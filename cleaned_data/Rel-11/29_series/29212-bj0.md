# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
**Application detection filter:** A logic used to detect packets generated by
an application based on extended inspection of these packets, e.g., header
and/or payload information, as well as dynamics of packet flows. The logic is
entirely internal to a TDF or a PCEF enhanced with ADC, and is out of scope of
this specification.
**Application identifier:** An identifier, referring to a specific application
detection filter.
**ADC decision:** A decision consists of references to ADC rules, associated
enforcement actions (for dynamic ADC rules) and TDF session attributes and is
provided by the PCRF to the TDF for application detection and control.
**ADC rule:** A set of information enabling the detection of application
traffic and associated enforcement actions. ADC rules are directly provisioned
into the TDF and referenced by the PCRF.
**Detected application traffic:** An aggregate set of packet flows that are
generated by a given application and detected by an application detection
filter.
**IP-CAN bearer:** IP transmission path of defined capacity, delay and bit
error rate, etc.\ See 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] for the definition of bearer.
**IP-CAN session:** association between a UE and an IP network.\ The
association is identified by one or more UE Ipv4 addresses/ and/or Ipv6 prefix
together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN represented
by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or more IP-CAN
bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is IP-CAN
specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix are assigned and announced to the IP network.
**IP flow:** unidirectional flow of IP packets with the same source IP address
and port number and the same destination IP address and port number and the
same transport protocol.\ Port numbers are only applicable if used by the
transport protocol.
**Gateway Control Session:** An association between a BBERF and a PCRF (when
GTP is not used in the EPC), used for transferring access specific parameters,
BBERF events and QoS rules between the PCRF and BBERF. In the context of this
specification this is implemented by use of the Gxx procedures.
**Monitoring key** : Identifies a usage monitoring control instance.
**TDF session:** An association between an IP-CAN session and the assigned TDF
for the purpose of application detection and control by the PCRF. The
association is identified by one UE Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix together
with optionally a PDN represented by a PDN ID and a set of ADC rules to be
applied by the TDF.
**Usage monitoring control instance** : the monitoring and reporting of the
usage threshold for input, output or total data volume for the IP-CAN
session/TDF session or the service data flows/application\'s traffic
associated with the same monitoring key.
**Service data flow:** An aggregate set of packet flows carried through the
PCEF that matches a service data flow template (from 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]).
**Service data flow filter:** a set of packet flow header parameter
values/ranges used to identify one or more of the packet flows constituting a
service data flow (from 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]).
**Service data flow template:** The set of service data flow filters in a PCC
rule or an application identifier in a PCC rule referring to an application
detection filter, required for defining a service data flow (from 3GPP TS
23.203 [7]).

# 4 Gx reference point
## 4.1 Overview
The Gx reference point is located between the Policy and Charging Rules
Function (PCRF) and the Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF). The
Gx reference point is used for provisioning and removal of PCC rules from the
PCRF to the PCEF and the transmission of traffic plane events from the PCEF to
the PCRF. The Gx reference point can be used for charging control, policy
control or both by applying AVPs relevant to the application. The Gx reference
point can also be used for application\'s traffic detection and control.
The stage 2 level requirements for the Gx reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [7].
Signalling flows related to the both Rx and Gx interfaces are specified in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
The definition of case 1, case 2a and case 2b is specified in clause 4.0 in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
## 4.2 Gx Reference model
The Gx reference point is defined between the PCRF and the PCEF. The
relationships between the different functional entities involved are depicted
in figure 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.
Figure 4.2.1: Gx reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with SPR

## 4.3 PCC Rules
### 4.3.1 PCC Rule Definition
The purpose of the PCC rule is to:
\- Detect a packet belonging to a service data flow.
\- The service data flowtemplates within the PCC rule are used for the
selection of downlink IP CAN bearers.
\- The service data flow filters within the PCC rule are used for the
enforcement that uplink IP flows are transported in the correct IP CAN bearer.
NOTE 1: For a PCC rule that contains an application identifier referencing an
application detection filter, the PCRF can inspect traffic on multiple bearers
in the uplink direction. Such detected traffic counts as detection by that PCC
rule.
\- Identify the service the service data flow contributes to.
\- Provide applicable charging parameters for a service data flow.
\- Provide policy control for a service data flow.
The PCEF shall check each received packet against the service data flow
filters of each PCC rule in the order of the precedence of the PCC rules. When
a packet matches a service data flow filter, the packet matching process for
that packet is completed, and the corresponding PCC rule shall be applied. For
PCC rules that contain an application identifier referencing an application
detection filter, the precedence is only relevant for the rule enforcement,
i.e. when the detected application packet matches multiple PCC rules, only the
enforcement, reporting of application starts and stops, usage monitoring, and
charging actions of the PCC rule with the highest precedence shall be applied.
There are two different types of PCC rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]:
\- Dynamic PCC rules. Dynamically provisioned by the PCRF to the PCEF via the
Gx interface. These PCC rules may be either predefined or dynamically
generated in the PCRF. Dynamic PCC rules can be installed, modified and
removed at any time.
\- Predefined PCC rules. Preconfigured in the PCEF. Predefined PCC rules can
be activated or deactivated by the PCRF at any time. Predefined PCC rules
within the PCEF may be grouped allowing the PCRF to dynamically activate a set
of PCC rules over the Gx reference point.
NOTE 2: The operator may define a predefined PCC rule, to be activated by the
PCEF. Such a predefined rule is not explicitly known in the PCRF.
A PCC rule consists of:
\- a rule name;
\- service identifier;
\- service data flow filter(s);
\- application identifier;
\- precedence;
\- gate status;
\- QoS parameters;
\- indication for PS to CS session continuity;
\- charging key (i.e. rating group);
\- other charging parameters;
\- monitoring key;
\- sponsor identity;
\- application service provider identity;
\- indication of access network information reporting;
\- redirect.
The rule name shall be used to reference a PCC rule in the communication
between the PCEF and the PCRF.
The service identifier shall be used to identify the service or the service
component the service data flow relates to.
The service data flow filter(s) or the application detection filter shall be
used to select the traffic for which the rule applies. Either service data
flow filter(s) or application identifier shall exist in a PCC rule. It shall
be possible to define wildcarded service data flow filter(s), both for the
dynamic and predefined PCC rules.
The application identifier shall be used to reference an application detection
filter, which is predefined in the PCEF. The same application identifier value
can occur in more than one PCC rule. If so, the PCRF shall ensure that there
is at most one PCC rule active per application identifier value and IP CAN
session at any time.
NOTE 3: The application identifier can only be used for PCEF enhanced with
ADC. The same application identifier value could be used for a dynamic PCC
rule and a pre-defined PCC rule or for multiple pre-defined PCC rules.
The gate status indicates whether the service data flow may pass (gate is
open) or shall be discarded (gate is closed) in uplink and/or in downlink
direction.
The QoS information includes the QoS class identifier (authorized QoS class
for the service data flow), the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) and
authorized bitrates for uplink and downlink.
The PS to CS session continuity indicates that the service data flow may be
handed over to the CS domain as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [40].
The charging parameters define whether online and offline charging interfaces
are used, what is to be metered in offline charging, on what level the PCEF
shall report the usage related to the rule, etc.
For different PCC rules with overlapping service data flow filter, the
precedence of the rule determines which of these rules is applicable. For PCC
rules with application detection filter, the precedence of the rule is only
relevant for the enforcement or charging of the detected application. When a
dynamic PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same precedence, the
dynamic PCC rule takes precedence. For dynamic PCC rules that contain an
application identifier, the precedence shall be either preconfigured at the
PCEF or provided dynamically by the PCRF within the PCC Rules.
NOTE 4: Whether precedence for dynamic PCC rules that contain an application
identifier is preconfigured in PCEF or provided in the PCC rule from the PCRF
depends on network configuration.
PCC rule also includes Application Function record information for enabling
charging correlation between the application and bearer layer if the AF has
provided this information via the Rx interface. For IMS this includes the IMS
Charging Identifier (ICID) and flow identifiers.
The monitoring key for a PCC rule identifies a monitoring control instance
that shall be used for usage monitoring control of the service data flows
controlled by the predefined PCC rule or dynamic PCC rule.
If sponsored data connectivity is supported, the sponsor identity for a PCC
rule identifies the 3^rd^ party organization (the sponsor) willing to pay for
the operator\'s charge for connectivity required to deliver a service to the
end user.
If sponsored data connectivity is supported, the application service provider
identity for a PCC rule identifies the 3^rd^ party organization (the ASP) that
is delivering the service to the end user.
If Access Network Information Reporting is supported, the value of Required-
Access-Info AVP for a PCC rule identifies the Access Network Information
parameters requested by the AF.
The redirect indicates whether the uplink part of the detected application
traffic shall be redirected to a controlled address. The target redirect
address may also be included.
NOTE 5: The redirect is applicable when application identifier exists in the
PCC rule.
### 4.3.2 Operations on PCC Rules
For dynamic PCC rules, the following operations are available:
Installation: to provision a PCC rules that has not been already provisioned.
Modification: to modify a PCC rule already installed.
Removal: to remove a PCC rule already installed.
For predefined PCC rules, the following operations are available:
Activation: to allow the PCC rule being active.
Deactivation: to disallow the PCC rule.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4.5.2.0.
## 4.3a IP flow mobility routing rules
### 4.3a.1 Functional entities
The PCEF shall provide IP flow mobility routing rules and report IP flow
mobility routing rules related events to the PCRF via the Gx reference point.
The PCRF shall select either the PCEF or any applicable BBERF as the bearer
binding function for each service data flow based on the Routing Address
included in the IP flow mobility routing rules received from the PCEF.
### 4.3a.2 IP flow mobility routing rule definition
The IP flow mobility routing rule is used by the PCRF to select the applicable
BBF (BBERF or PCEF) for a service data flow in flow mobility scenarios and in
turn provision QoS rules related to the service data flow to the selected
BBERF.
The PCRF shall evaluate the service data flow filters against the routing
filter contained in the IP flow mobility routing rule in the order of the
precedence of the IP flow mobility routing rules. When a routing filter
matches the service data flow filter, the routing address contained in the
matching IP flow mobility routing rule shall be applied to the service data
flow.
An IP flow mobility routing rule consists of:
\- a rule identifier;
\- routing filter(s);
\- precedence;
\- routing address.
The rule identifier is assigned by the PCEF and shall be unique within an IP-
CAN session. It is used to reference an IP flow mobility routing rule in the
communication between the PCEF and the PCRF.
The IP flow mobility routing rule shall comprise one or more routing filters,
containing information for matching service data flows. A default packet
filter is specified by using wild card filters. The default packet filter is
used to indicate the default route for service data flows without explicit
route assignment. An IP flow mobility routing rule containing a default packet
filter shall not contain any other packet filters.
The precedence defines in what order the IP flow mobility routing rules are
used by the PCRF to determine where to route a service data flow. The
precedence of the IP flow mobility routing rules not containing the default
packet filter is derived from the priority assigned to the routing filters
included in the Binding Update as specified in 3GPP TS 23.261 [35]. The PCEF
shall assign the lowest evaluation precedence to the IP flow mobility routing
rule containing the default packet filter.
The routing address identifies the IP address and thus the BBF to be used for
all service data flows matching the routing filters contained in IP flow
mobility routing rules. The routing address can be equal to a care-of address
or to the home address of the UE. In case 1 and case 2b the routing address
contains the home address and in case 2a the routing address contains the
care-of address.
NOTE: IP flow mobility routing rules can be defined in case 1 only for 3GPP
access where GTP-based S5/S8 are employed or case 2b only for PMIP-based 3GPP
accesses.
### 4.3a.3 Operations on Routing rules
If IP flow mobility is supported as specified in 3GPP TS 23.261 [35], the PCEF
shall derive IP flow mobility routing rules based on the IP flow mobility
binding information provided by the UE. The rule contains information required
by the PCRF to install the PCC/QoS rules for a service data flow at the
correct BBF in flow mobility scenarios.
For IP flow mobility routing rules, the following operations are available:
\- Installation: the PCEF provides a new IP flow mobility routing rule to the
PCRF.
\- Modification: the PCEF modifies an existing IP flow mobility routing rule
already installed at the PCRF.
\- Removal: the PCEF removes an IP flow mobility routing rule already
installed at the PCRF.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4.3a.4.
### 4.3a.4 PCC procedures for IP flow mobility routing rule over Gx reference
point
#### 4.3a.4.1 Provisioning of IP flow mobility routing rules
When provisioning IP flow mobility routing rules, the PCEF executes the same
procedure as for a Request for PCC Rules as described in clause 4.5.1.
The PCEF may install IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-CAN session
establishment.
NOTE: PCEF installs IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-CAN session
establishment only in case 2a.
If the PCEF installs IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-CAN session
establishment:
\- In addition to the parameters defined in clause 4.5.1, the PCEF shall also
include in the CC-Request, IP flow mobility routing rules within the Routing-
Rule-Install AVP with one ore more Routing-Rule-Definition AVPs.
\- the PCEF shall include a default route within the Routing-Rule-Definition
AVP by including wildcarded filters within Routing-Filter AVP.
The PCEF may install, modify, and remove IP flow mobility routing rules at IP-
CAN session modification.
\- In such a case in addition to the parameters defined in clause 4.5.1, for
IP flow mobility routing rule installation and modification, the PCEF shall
include in the CC-Request the Routing-Rule-Install AVP with one or more
Routing-Rule-Definition AVPs containing the new and updated IP flow mobility
routing rules.
\- For IP flow mobility routing rule removal, the PCEF shall include the
Routing-Rule-Remove AVP with the Routing-Rule-Identifier of the rules to be
removed.
\- The PCEF shall also include the Event-Trigger AVP set to
ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE
At IP-CAN session termination as described in 4.5.7, the PCRF removes
instantly all IP flow mobility routing rules related to the terminated IP-CAN
session.
To install a new or modify an already installed IP flow mobility routing rule,
the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If an IP flow mobility routing
rule with the same rule identifier, as supplied in the Routing-Rule-Identifier
AVP within the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP, already exists at the PCRF, the
new IP flow mobility routing rule shall update the currently installed rule.
If the existing IP flow mobility routing rule already has attributes also
included in the new IP flow mobility routing rule definition, the existing
attributes shall be overwritten. Any attribute in the existing IP flow
mobility routing rule not included in the new IP flow mobility routing rule
definition shall remain valid.

## 4.4 Functional elements
### 4.4.1 PCRF
The PCRF (Policy Control and Charging Rules Function) is a functional element
that encompasses policy control decision and flow based charging control
functionalities. These 2 functionalities are the heritage of the release 6
logical entities PDF and CRF respectively. The PCRF provides network control
regarding the service data flow detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging
(except credit management) towards the PCEF. The PCRF receives session and
media related information from the AF and informs AF of traffic plane events.
The PCRF shall provision PCC Rules to the PCEF via the Gx reference point.
Particularities for the Gxx reference point are specified in clause 4a.4.1.
Particularities for the Sd reference point are specified in clause 4b.4.1.
If IP flow mobility applies, the PCRF shall, based on IP flow mobility routing
rules received from the PCEF, provide the authorized PCC/QoS rules to the
applicable BBF.
The PCRF PCC Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- Information obtained from the AF via the Rx reference point, e.g. the
session, media and subscriber related information.
\- Information obtained from the PCEF via the Gx reference point, e.g. IP-CAN
bearer attributes, request type, subscriber related information, IP flow
mobility routing rules (if IP flow mobility is supported) and detected
application\'s traffic information, if the PCEF supports Application Detection
and Control feature.
\- Information obtained from the SPR via the Sp reference point, e.g.
subscriber and service related data.
\- Information obtained from the TDF via the Sd reference point, e.g. report
on application\'s traffic detection start/stop.
NOTE: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in
this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
\- Information obtained from the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
\- Own PCRF pre-configured information.
If the information from the PCEF contains traffic mapping information not
matching any service data flow filter known to the PCRF, and the PCRF allows
the UE to request enhanced QoS for services not known to the PCRF, the PCRF
shall add this traffic mapping information as service data flow filters to the
corresponding authorized PCC Rule. The PCRF may wildcard missing filter
parameters, e.g. missing uplink TFT address and port information in case of
GPRS.
The PCRF shall report events to the AF via the Rx reference point.
The PCRF shall inform the PCEF through the use of PCC rules on the treatment
of each service data flow that is under PCC control, in accordance with the
PCRF policy decisions.
The PCRF shall be able to select the bearer control mode that will apply for
the IP-CAN session and provide it to the PCEF via the Gx reference point.
Upon subscription to loss of AF signalling bearer notifications by the AF, the
PCRF shall request the PCEF to notify the PCRF of the loss of resources
associated to the PCC Rules corresponding with AF Signalling IP Flows, if this
has not been requested previously.
If permitted by the subscriber\'s profile configuration received from the SPR,
the PCRF may invoke the application\'s traffic detection and control at the
PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, by providing the
corresponding PCC Rules.
### 4.4.2 PCEF
The PCEF (Policy and Charging Enforcement Function) is the functional element
that encompasses policy enforcement and flow based charging functionalities.
These 2 functionalities are the heritage of the release 6 logical entities PEP
and TPF respectively. This functional entity is located at the Gateway (e.g.
GGSN in the GPRS case, P-GW in the EPS case and PDG in the WLAN case). It
provides control over the user plane traffic handling at the Gateway and its
QoS, and provides service data flow detection and counting as well as online
and offline charging interactions.
For a service data flow that is under policy control the PCEF shall allow the
service data flow to pass through the Gateway if and only if the corresponding
gate is open.
For a service data flow that is under charging control the PCEF shall allow
the service data flow to pass through the Gateway if and only if there is a
corresponding active PCC rule and, for online charging, the OCS has authorized
the applicable credit with that Charging key. The PCEF may let a service data
flow pass through the Gateway during the course of the credit re-authorization
procedure.
If requested by the PCRF, the PCEF shall report to the PCRF when the status of
the related service data flow changes. This procedure can be used to monitor
an IP-CAN bearer dedicated for AF signalling traffic.
In case the SDF is tunnelled at the BBERF, the PCEF shall inform the PCRF
about the mobility protocol tunnelling header of the service data flows at IP-
CAN session establishment or IP-CAN session modification when the tunnelling
header information is changed.
If requested by PCRF, a PCEF, which supports Application Detection and Control
feature, shall:
\- Perform application\'s traffic detection and control
\- Report the detected application\'s traffic start/stop events to the PCRF
along with TDF application instance identifier and service data flow
descriptions when service data flow descriptions are deducible.
A PCEF shall ensure that an IP packet, which is discarded at the PCEF as a
result of PCC rule enforcement, is neither reported for offline charging nor
cause credit consumption for online charging.
## 4.5 PCC procedures over Gx reference point
### 4.5.1 Request for PCC rules
The PCEF shall indicate, via the Gx reference point, a request for PCC rules
in the following instances.
1) At IP-CAN session establishment:
\- The PCEF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\". The PCEF shall supply user identification within the
Subscription-Id AVP and other attributes to allow the PCRF to identify the
rules to be applied. The other attributes shall include the type of IP-CAN
within the IP-CAN-Type AVP, the type of the radio access technology, if
available, within the RAT-Type AVP, the PDN information, if available, within
the Called-Station-Id AVP, the PDN connection identifier, if available, within
the PDN-Connection-ID AVP, the UE Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address
and/or the UE Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP and the UE time
zone information within 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available. The PCEF may also
include the Access‑Network-Charging-Address and Access‑Network-Charging-
Identifier-Gx AVPs, the SGSN address within either 3GPP-SGSN-Address AVP or
3GPP-SGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP, the user location information within 3GPP-User-
Location-Info, the Routing Area Identity within RAI AVP, the PLMN id within
the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP, the information about the user equipment within
User-Equipment-Info AVP in the CC-Request. Furthermore, if applicable for the
IP-CAN type, the PCEF may indicate the support of network-initiated bearer
request procedures by supplying the Network-Request-Support AVP. The PCEF
shall also include the APN-AMBR if available using the APN-Aggregate-Max-
Bitrate-DL/UL AVPs. If available, the PCEF shall also provide an indication if
the default bearer is requested to be used for IMS signalling using the
Bearer-Usage AVP. If UE provides information of IP flow mobility change, the
PCEF includes IP flow mobility routing rules as defined in clause 4.3a.4 . The
PCEF may provide TDF-Information AVP, if available.
For IP-CAN types that support multiple IP-CAN bearers, the PCEF may provide
the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the ARP and QCI values corresponding
to the Default EPS Bearer QoS.
For 3GPP-EPS and 3GPP2 accesses, the PCEF shall provide the IP address(es)
(Ipv4 or Ipv6, if available) of the SGW/AGW within the AN-GW-Address AVP.
For xDSL IP-CAN Type the PCEF may provide the Subscription-Id AVP and shall
not provide the RAT Type AVP, The Logical-Access-ID AVP and the Physical-
Access-ID AVP shall be provided.
2) At IP-CAN session modification:
\- IP-CAN session modification with PCEF-requested rules can occur for various
reasons, e.g. when:
\- a request to establish or terminate an IP-CAN bearer occurs;
\- a request for resource modification occurs;
\- an Event trigger is met.
The PCEF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\". The PCEF may include the Access‑Network-Charging-Address
and Access‑Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVPs in the CC-Request. For an IP-
CAN Session modification where an existing IP-CAN Bearer is modified, the PCEF
shall supply within the PCC rule request the specific event which caused the
IP-CAN session modification (within the Event-Trigger AVP) and any related
data affected by the IP-CAN session modification. Any change in PCC rule
status shall be supplied to PCRF within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP. If UE
provides information of IP flow mobility change, the PCEF includes IP flow
mobility routing rules to the PCRF as specified in clause 4.3a.4.
In the case that the UE initiates a resource modification procedure, the PCEF
shall include within the CC-Request the Event-Trigger AVP set to
RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST and shall include the Packet-Filter-Operation
AVP set as follows, with the amendments as specified in Annex A and Annex B:
\- When the UE requests to add filters without any link to existing bearer or
existing packet filter, the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to
\"ADDITION\", and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter requested for
addition;
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the new packet
filters.
\- When the UE requests to add filters, including a link to an existing packet
filter, the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"ADDITION\",
and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter requested for
addition; and
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP, set to the value for the linked existing filter; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the new packet
filters and the PCC rule containing the linked packet filter.
\- When the UE requests to modify existing packet filter the PCEF shall set
the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP, including its Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP
value, for each modified packet filter; and
\- if the UE request includes modified QoS information the PCEF shall also
include the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the updated QoS for the affected
PCC rule(s).
\- When the UE requests to modify the QoS associated with existing packet
filter(s), without modifying the filter(s), the PCEF shall set the Packet-
Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include:
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP, set to the value for each of the affected packet filter(s); and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the updated QoS for the affected PCC
rule(s).
\- When the UE requests to delete existing packet filter the PCEF shall set
the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\", and shall include:
\- a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter deleted by the UE.
Each Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include a packet filter identifier as
provided by the PCRF in the PCC rule within the Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP
identifying the previously requested packet filter being deleted; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the updated QoS for the affected PCC
rule(s).
The PCEF shall calculate the requested GBR, for a GBR QCI, as the sum of the
previously authorized GBR for the set of affected PCC rules, containing one or
more affected packet filter, adjusted with the difference between the
requested GBR for the bearer and previously negotiated GBR for the bearer. For
the UE request to add filters, without providing any link to an existing
filter, the GBR as requested by the UE for those filters shall be used.
If the request covers all the PCC rules with a bearer binding to the same
bearer, then the PCEF may request a change to the QCI for existing packet
filters.
A PCC rule is affected if one or more previously assigned packet filter
identifiers for filters within the rule are included with the Packet-Filter-
Identifier AVP within the request.
For the purpose of adding or modifying a packet filter, the Packet-Filter-
Information AVP shall include the packet filter precedence information within
the Precedence AVP and the Packet-Filter-Content, ToS-Traffic-Class, Security-
Parameter-Index, Flow-Label and Flow-Direction AVPs set to the value(s)
describing the packet filter provided by the UE.
PCC rules can also be requested as a consequence of a failure in the PCC rule
installation/activation or enforcement without requiring an Event-Trigger. See
clause 4.5.12.
NOTE 1: The UE signalling with the network is governed by the applicable NAS
signalling TS. The NAS 3GPP TS for a specific access may restrict the UE
possibilities to make requests compared to what is stated above.
If the PCRF is, due to incomplete, erroneous or missing information (e.g. QoS,
SGSN address, RAT type, TFT, subscriber information) not able to provision a
policy decision as response to the request for PCC rules by the PCEF, the PCRF
may reject the request using a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140). If the PCEF receives a CC Answer
with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session establishment or
modification that initiated the CC Request.
If the PCRF detects that the packet filters in the request for new PCC rules
received from the PCEF is covered by the packet filters of outstanding PCC
rules that the PCRF is provisioning to the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the
request using a CC-Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFLICTING_REQUEST (5147). If the PCEF receives a CC-Answer
with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session modification that
initiated the CC-Request.
If the PCRF does not accept one or more of the traffic mapping filters
provided by the PCEF in a CC Request (e.g. because the PCRF does not allow the
UE to request enhanced QoS for services not known to the PCRF), the PCRF shall
reject the request using a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144). If the PCEF receives a CC
Answer with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session establishment
or modification that initiated the CC Request.
The PCRF shall not combine a rejection with provisioning of PCC rule
operations in the same CC Answer.
### 4.5.2 Provisioning of PCC rules
#### 4.5.2.0 Overview
The PCRF shall indicate, via the Gx reference point, PCC rules to be applied
at the PCEF. This may be using one of the following procedures:
\- PULL procedure (Provisioning solicited by the PCEF): In response to a
request for PCC rules being made by the PCEF, as described in the preceding
clause, the PCRF shall provision PCC rules in the CC-Answer; or
\- PUSH procedure (Unsolicited provisioning): The PCRF may decide to provision
PCC rules without obtaining a request from the PCEF, e.g. in response to
information provided to the PCRF via the Rx reference point, or in response to
an internal trigger within the PCRF. To provision PCC rules without a request
from the PCEF, the PCRF shall include these PCC rules in an RA-Request
message. No CCR/CCA messages are triggered by this RA-Request. The PCRF should
NOT send a new RA-Request command to the PCEF until the previous RA-Request
has been acknowledged for the same IP-CAN session.
For each request from the PCEF or upon the unsolicited provision the PCRF
shall provision zero or more PCC rules. The PCRF may perform an operation on a
single PCC rule by one of the following means:
\- To activate or deactivate a PCC rule that is predefined at the PCEF, the
PCRF shall provision a reference to this PCC rule within a Charging-Rule-Name
AVP and indicate the required action by choosing either the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP or the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- To install or modify a PCRF-provisioned PCC rule, the PCRF shall provision
a corresponding Charging-Rule-Definition AVP within a Charging-Rule-Install
AVP.
\- To remove a PCC rule which has previously been provisioned by the PCRF, the
PCRF shall provision the name of this PCC rule as value of a Charging-Rule-
Name AVP within a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- If, for certain accesses, the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF
may move previously installed or activated PCC rules from one IP CAN bearer to
another IP CAN bearer. See annex A for further details.
As an alternative to providing a single PCC rule, the PCRF may provide a
Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP or the
Charging-Rule-Remove AVP as a reference to a group of PCC rules predefined at
the PCEF. With a Charging-Rule-Install AVP, a predefined group of PCC rules is
activated. With a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP, a predefined group of PCC rules is
deactivated.
The PCRF may combine multiple of the above PCC rule operations in a single
command.
When the UE initiates a resource modification procedure, the PCRF shall
provision PCC rule(s) that are only related to the UE\'s resource modification
in the corresponding CCA command.
To activate a predefined PCC rule at the PCEF, the rule name within a
Charging-Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP as
a reference to the predefined rule. To activate a group of predefined PCC
rules within the PCEF (e.g. gold users or gaming services) a Charging-Rule-
Base-Name AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP as a
reference to the group of predefined PCC rules.
To install a new or modify an already installed PCRF defined PCC rule, the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If a PCC rule with the same rule
name, as supplied in the Charging-Rule-Name AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP, already exists at the PCEF, the new PCC rule shall update the
currently installed rule. If the existing PCC rule already has attributes also
included in the new PCC rule definition, the existing attributes shall be
overwritten. Any attribute in the existing PCC rule not included in the new
PCC rule definition shall remain valid.
If no PCC rule(s) with uplink packet filters that are provided to the UE are
bound to a bearer which requires traffic mapping information (according to the
rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]), the PCEF shall derive traffic
mapping information based on implementation specific logic (e.g. traffic
mapping information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in
uplink direction as described in clause 15.3.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]) and
shall provide it to the UE.
NOTE 1: For GPRS and EPS, the state of TFT packet filters, as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.060 [17], for an IP-CAN session requires that there is at most one
bearer with no traffic mapping information for the uplink direction.
NOTE 2: For a default bearer, the PCEF will not add traffic mapping
information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink
direction on its own.
Upon installation or activation of a PCC rule, the PCEF shall then perform the
bearer binding according to clause 5.4 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] and use the
select IP CAN bearer for the new PCC rule.
Upon the same modification of the QCI and/or ARP of all the PCC rules bound to
the same bearer, the PCEF should modify the QCI and/or ARP for that bearer.
Provisioning of predefined PCC rules upon invocation/revocation of an MPS
service shall be done according to clause 5.3 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
Further details of the binding mechanism can be found in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
For deactivating single predefined or removing PCRF-provided PCC rules, the
Charging-Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
For deactivating a group of predefined PCC rules, the Charging-Rule-Base-Name
AVP shall be supplied within a Charging-Rule-Remove AVP.
NOTE 3: When deactivating a predefined PCC rule that is activated in more than
one IP-CAN bearers, the predefined PCC rule is deactivated simultaneously in
all the IP-CAN bearers where it was previously activated.
The PCRF may request the PCEF to confirm that the resources associated to a
PCC rule are successfully allocated. To do so the PCRF shall provide the
Event-Trigger AVP with the value SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (22) if the
event trigger is not previously set. In addition the PCRF shall install the
rules that need resource allocation confirmation by including the Resource-
Allocation-Notification AVP with the value ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (0) within the
corresponding Charging-Rule-Install AVP. If a Charging-Rule-Install AVP does
not include the Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP, the resource allocation
shall not be notified by the PCEF even if this AVP was present in previous
installations of the same rule.
NOTE 4: The PCEF reporting the successful installation of PCC rules using RAA
command means that the PCC rules are installed but the bearer binding or QoS
resource reservation may not yet be completed, see 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
If the provisioning of PCC rules fails, the PCEF informs the PCRF as described
in clause 4.5.12 PCC Rule Error Handling. Depending on the cause, the PCRF may
decide if re-installation, modification, removal of PCC rules or any other
action applies.
If the PCRF is unable to create a PCC rule for the response to the CC Request
by the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the request as described in clause 4.5.1.
If the PCRF receives a request for PCC rules for an IP-CAN session from the
PCEF, or a request for QoS rules for a gateway control session from the BBERF,
while no suitable authorized PCC rules are configured in the PCRF or can be
derived from service information provisioned by an AF, the PCRF shall check
the set of services the user is allowed to access.
If the user is not allowed to access AF session based services, the PCRF shall
check whether the user is allowed to request resources for services not known
to the PCRF and whether the requested QoS and/or packet filters can be
authorized. If this is the case, the PCRF shall provide a PCC rule to
authorize the UE requested QoS and packet filters that were received as part
of the request for PCC/QoS rules. The service data flow description shall be
derived from the packet filter information. If the user is not allowed to
request resources for services not known to the PCRF, the PCRF shall reject
the request.
If the user is allowed to access AF session based services, the PCRF may,
depending e.g. on the user\'s subscription details or operator policy,
authorise the requested QoS for a timer supervised grace period (the timer
started by the PCRF either by the request from the PCEF or from the BBERF) to
wait for AF service information. If an AF session bound to the same IP-CAN
session is ongoing and only preliminary service information was received
within this AF session, the PCRF shall base the authorization of the requested
QoS on the preliminary service information.
NOTE 5: This scenario may for instance be encountered for a UE terminated IMS
session establishment or modification with UE initiated resource reservation,
refer to 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]. If the PCRF does not authorize a request for
PCC/QoS rules in this scenario, the IMS session setup may fail.
NOTE 6: During the grace period, the QoS and packet filters requested by the
UE need to be authorized even if the user is not allowed to request for
resources for services not known to the PCRF or if the requested QCI is not
allowed for services not known to the PCRF as it is not clear at this point in
time whether the UE resource request belongs to an AF session or to a service
not known to the PCRF.
If the preliminary service information is insufficient to construct
appropriate PCC rules or no preliminary service information is available, the
PCRF shall provide preliminary PCC rules to authorize the UE requested QoS and
packet filters. Therefore, the preliminary PCC rules shall contain wildcarded
flow description or flow description derived from possible packet filters
received as part of the request for PCC/QoS rules. The PCRF may apply a
dedicated charging key value to indicate to the charging subsystem that the
charging key is preliminary and may be corrected later on.
NOTE 7: With the dedicated charging key, the PCRF instructs the charging
subsystem to recalculate the applicable charge for the time when the dedicated
charging key value was applied once the dedicated charging key value is
replaced with some other value in a new provisioning of PCC rules. For
example, if online charging applies, Session Charging with Unit Reservation
(SCUR) can be used .When the charging key changes, the PCEF will return
initially reserved credit units and the OCS then can recalculate the consumed
credit units applying the rate derived from the new other charging key value
and update the user\'s credit accordingly.
NOTE 8: A preliminary PCC rule is a normal PCC rule containing preliminary
information.
If the PCRF receives AF service information while the timer-supervised grace
period is running, the PCRF shall stop the timer and may derive authorized PCC
rules from this service information and update or replace the preliminary PCC
rules that were previously provided for the UE requested QoS and packet
filters, for instance by choosing service specific QoS parameters and charging
keys.
NOTE 9: The dedicated preliminary charging key value that was previously
provided by the PCRF instructs the charging subsystem to recalculate the
applicable charge when the new service specific charging key is provided. The
recalculation covers the time when the previous dedicated charging key value
was active. The new service specific charging key is applied from that time
onwards.
If the timer expires and the PCRF has not received any AF service information,
the PCRF should apply the policy for services not known to the PCRF and may
downgrade or revoke the authorization for the preliminary PCC/QoS rules
(previously provided for the UE requested QoS and packet filters) in
accordance with the policy for services not known to the PCRF. The PCRF should
adjust the charging keys within the PCC rules and should downgrade the
authorized QoS to the allowed value for the services not known to the PCRF, if
required.
For the case where the BBERF requests QoS rules from the PCRF, the PCRF
derives the QoS rules from the PCC rules and provisions the QoS rules to the
BBERF according to clause 4a.5.2.
If the IP flow mobility is supported and the tariff depends on what access
network is in use for the sevice data flow, then the PCRF may set the charging
key of the PCC rule in accordance with the access network in use.
#### 4.5.2.1 Selecting a PCC rule for Uplink IP packets
If PCC is enabled, the PCEF shall select the applicable PCC rule for each
received uplink IP packet within an IP CAN bearer by evaluating the packet
against uplink service data flow template of PCRF-provided or predefined
active PCC rules assigned to this IP CAN bearer.
PCC rules shall be assigned to an IP CAN bearer via bearer binding; PCC Rules
that contain an application identifier may be assigned to other bearer(s) with
non-GBR QCI (e.g. the default bearer) in addition to the bearer where the PCC
rule is bound to.
NOTE 1: The PCEF uses implementation specific logic to assign PCC Rules that
contain an application identifier to additional bearer(s) for uplink bearer
binding verification, i.e. to determine for what bearers the uplink service
data flow detection applies. When PCC rules with application detection filters
cannot be used to generate traffic mapping information for the UE, the
application detection may need to inspect traffic on multiple bearers. The
uplink traffic will get the QoS of the bearer carrying the traffic. The QCI of
the bearer may therefore be different than the QCI of the PCC rule detecting
the service data flow. The charging and other enforcement functions performed
by the PCEF will still be carried out based on parameters of the PCC rule
detecting the service data flow. In case the PCC rule contains a GBR QCI, the
GBR resource reservation will only apply on the bearer where the PCC rule is
bound to. The PCRF can prevent that uplink GBR resources are reserved by
providing an uplink GBR value of zero in the PCC rule.
For PCC rules that contain service data flow filters, the evaluation of
packets against the service data flow templates shall be done in the order of
the precedence of the PCC rules. When a packet matches a service data flow
template, the packet matching process for that packet is completed, and the
PCC rule for that template shall be applied.
For PCC rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an
application detection filter), the order and the details of the application
detection are implementation specific. Once an application has been detected,
the PCC rule shall however be applied under consideration of the PCC rule
precedence, i.e. when multiple PCC rules overlap (regardless of whether they
contain service data flow filters or an application identifier), only the PCC
rule with the highest precedence shall be applied and the packet matching
process for that packet is completed.
When a PCRF-provided PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same
precedence, the uplink service data flow template of the PCRF-provided PCC
rule shall be applied.
Uplink IP packets which do not match any PCC rule assigned to the
corresponding IP CAN bearer shall be silently discarded.
#### 4.5.2.2 Selecting a PCC rule and IP CAN Bearer for Downlink IP packets
If PCC is enabled, the PCEF shall select a PCC rule for each received downlink
IP packet within an IP CAN session by evaluating the packet against downlink
service data flow templates of PCRF-provided or predefined active PCC rules of
all IP CAN bearers of the IP CAN session.
For PCC rules that contain service data flow filters, the evaluation of
packets against the service data flow templates shall be done in the order of
the precedence of the PCC rules. When a packet matches a service data flow
template, the packet matching process for that packet is completed, and the
PCC rule for that template shall be applied.
For PCC rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an
application detection filter), the order and the details of the application
detection are implementation specific. Once an application has been detected,
the PCC rule shall however be applied under consideration of the PCC rule
precedence, i.e. when multiple PCC rules overlap (regardless of whether they
contain service data flow filters or an application identifier), only the PCC
rule with the highest precedence shall be applied and the packet matching
process for that packet is completed.
When a PCRF-provided PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same
precedence, the downlink service data flow template of the PCRF-provided PCC
rule shall be applied.
The Downlink IP Packet shall be transported within the IP CAN bearer where the
selected PCC rule is mapped.
Downlink IP packets which do not match any PCC rule of the IP CAN session
shall be silently discarded.
#### 4.5.2.3 Gate function
The Gate Function represents a user plane function enabling or disabling the
forwarding of IP packets belonging to a service data flow. A gate is described
within a PCC rule. If the PCC rule contains Flow-Information AVP(s) applicable
for uplink IP flows, it shall describe a gate for the corresponding uplink IP
flows. If the PCC rule contains Flow-Information AVP(s) applicable for
downlink IP flows, it shall describe a gate for the corresponding downlink IP
flows. If the PCC rule contains the application identifier, it shall describe
a gate for the corresponding detected application traffic. The Flow-Status AVP
of the PCC rule shall describe if the possible uplink and possible downlink
gate is opened or closed.
The commands to open or close the gate shall lead to the enabling or disabling
of the passage for corresponding IP packets. If the gate is closed all packets
of the related IP flows shall be dropped. If the gate is opened the packets of
the related IP flows are allowed to be forwarded.
#### 4.5.2.4 Policy enforcement for \"Authorized QoS\" per PCC Rule
The PCRF can provide the authorized QoS for a PCC rule to the PCEF. The
Provisioning of authorized QoS per PCC Rule shall be performed using the PCC
rule provisioning procedure. For a PCRF-provided PCC rule, the \"Authorized
QoS\" shall be encoded using a QoS-Information AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP of the PCC rule. If \"Authorized QoS\" is provided for a PCC
rule, the PCEF shall enforce the corresponding policy.
See also Clause 4.5.5.
#### 4.5.2.5 Usage Monitoring Control
Usage monitoring may be performed for service data flows associated with one
or more PCC rules.
The provisioning of usage monitoring control per PCC rule shall be performed
using the PCC rule provisioning procedure. For a PCRF-provided PCC rule, the
monitoring key shall be set using the Monitoring-Key AVP within the Charging-
Rule-Definition AVP of the PCC rule. For a predefined PCC rule, the monitoring
key shall be included in the rule definition at the PCEF. Usage monitoring
shall be activated both for service data flows associated with predefined PCC
rules and dynamic PCC rules, including rules with deferred activation and/or
deactivation times while those rules are active.
NOTE: It is recommended that the same traffic is not monitored by both PCC
rules in the PCEF and ADC rules in the TDF with active usage monitoring at the
same time. This avoids double counting.
#### 4.5.2.6 Redirect function
The PCRF may provide the redirect instruction for a dynamic PCC rule to the
PCEF enhanced with ADC. The Provisioning shall be performed using the PCC rule
provisioning procedure. The redirect instruction shall be encoded using a
Redirect-Information AVP within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP of the
dynamic PCC rule.
For a dynamic PCC rule, the redirect address may be provided as part of the
dynamic PCC rule or may be preconfigured in the PCEF. A redirect destination
provided within the Redirect-Server-Address AVP in a dynamic PCC Rule shall
override the redirect destination preconfigured in the PCEF for this PCC rule.
NOTE: The PCEF uses the preconfigured redirection address only if it can be
applied to the application traffic being detected, e.g. the redirection
destination address could be preconfigured on a per application identifier
basis.
If Redirect-Information AVP is provided for a dynamic PCC rule, the PCEF shall
implement the redirection for the detected application\'s uplink traffic. If
the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is provided within the Redirect-Information
AVP and the Redirect-Support AVP is not set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED, the PCEF
shall redirect the detected application\'s uplink traffic to this address. In
this case, the redirect address type (e.g. Ipv4, Ipv6 or URL) shall be defined
by the Redirect-Address-Type AVP. If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not
provided, the redirection address preconfigured in the PCEF shall be used
instead. If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not provided and the
redirection address is not preconfigured in the PCEF for this PCC rule, the
PCEF shall perform PCC Rule Error Handling as specified in clause 4.5.12.
When the PCRF wants to disable the redirect function for an already installed
PCC Rule, the PCRF shall update the PCC rule including the Redirect-
Information AVP with Redirect-Support AVP set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED.
### 4.5.3 Provisioning of Event Triggers
The PCRF may provide one or several event triggers within one or several
Event-Trigger AVP to the PCEF using the PCC rule provision procedure. Event
triggers may be used to determine which IP-CAN session modification or
specific event causes the PCEF to re-request PCC rules. Although event trigger
reporting from PCEF to PCRF can apply for an IP CAN session or bearer
depending on the particular event, provisioning of event triggers will be done
at session level. The Event-Trigger AVP may be provided in combination with
the initial or subsequent PCC rule provisioning.
NOTE 1: There are event triggers that will only take effect when additional
information is provided. The PCRF may provide the additional information
together with the event trigger or in subsequent PCC rule provisioning.The
PCEF will only report those event triggers when the related data is available.
The PCRF may add new event triggers or remove the already provided ones at
each request from the PCEF or upon the unsolicited provision from the PCRF. In
order to do so, the PCRF shall provide the new complete list of applicable
event triggers including the needed provisioned Event-Trigger AVPs in the CCA
or RAR commands.
The PCRF may remove all previously provided event triggers by providing the
Event-Trigger AVP set to the value NO_EVENT_TRIGGERS. When an Event-Trigger
AVP is provided with this value, no other Event-Trigger AVP shall be provided
in the CCA or RAR command. Upon reception of an Event-Trigger AVP with this
value, the PCEF shall not inform PCRF of any event except for those events
that are always reported and do not require provisioning from the PCRF.
If no Event-Trigger AVP is included in a CCA or RAR operation, any previously
provisioned event trigger will be still applicable. Unless otherwise stated
for a certain event trigger, the PCRF shall be able to modify the data related
to an event trigger without providing again a previously provisioned event
trigger if such event trigger is still armed.
There are event triggers that are required to be unconditionally reported from
the PCEF to the PCRF as specified in clause 5.3.7 even though the PCRF has not
provisioned them to the PCEF.
### 4.5.4 Provisioning of charging related information for the IP-CAN session
#### 4.5.4.1 Provisioning of Charging Addresses
In combination with the initial PCC rule provisioning only, the PCRF may
provide OFCS and/or OCS addresses within a Charging-Information AVP to the
PCEF defining the offline and online charging system addresses respectively.
These shall overwrite any predefined addresses at the PCEF. Both primary and
secondary addresses for OFCS and/or OCS shall be provided simultaneously.
Provisioning OFCS or OCS addresses without PCC rules for offline or online
charged service data flows, respectively, shall not be considered as an error
since such PCC rules may be provided in later provisioning.
#### 4.5.4.2 Provisioning of Default Charging Method
The default charging method indicates what charging method shall be used for
every PCC rule where the charging method is omitted. The PCEF may have a pre-
configured Default charging method.
Upon the initial interaction with the PCRF, the PCEF shall provide the pre-
configured Default charging method if available within the Online AVP and/or
Offline AVP embedded directly within the CCR command to the PCRF.
Upon the initial interaction with the PCEF, the PCRF may provide default
charging method within the Online AVP or Offline AVP embedded directly within
the CCA command to the PCEF. The default charging method provided by the PCRF
shall overwrite any predefined default charging method at the PCEF.
#### 4.5.4.3 Void
#### 4.5.4.4 Provisioning of Access Network Charging Identifier
When the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP is unknown to the PCRF, the
PCRF may request the PCEF to provide the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx
AVP associated to dynamic PCC rules. To do so, the PCRF shall provide the
Event-Trigger AVP with the value CHARGING_CORRELATION_EXCHANGE (28) if the
event trigger is not previously set and the Charging-Correlation-Indicator AVP
indicating CHARGING_IDENTIFIER_REQUIRED within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
If the Event-Trigger AVP with the value CHARGING_CORRELATION_EXCHANGE (28) has
been provided to the PCEF, the PCEF shall include the access network charging
identifier that the PCEF has assigned for the dynamic PCC Rules within the
Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx where the Charging-Correlation-Indicator
AVP indicated CHARGING_IDENTIFIER_REQUIRED.
NOTE: The PCRF indicates CHARGING_IDENTIFIER_REQUIRED in the Charging-
Correlation-Indicator AVP for the dynamic PCC rules related to the flows for
which the AF has requested a notification about Access Network Charging
Information, according to 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].
### 4.5.5 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
#### 4.5.5.0 Overview
The PCRF may provide authorized QoS to the PCEF.
The authorized QoS shall be provisioned within a CCA or RAR Diameter message
as QoS-Information AVP. The provisioning of the authorized QoS (which is
composed of QCI, ARP and bitrates) is performed from the PCRF to the PCEF. The
authorized QoS can refer to a PCC rule, to an IP CAN bearer, to a QCI or to an
APN.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to an IP CAN bearer, it shall be
provisioned outside a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and it shall also include
the Bearer-Identifier AVP to indicate what bearer it applies to.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to a PCC rule, it shall be provisioned
within the corresponding PCC rule by including the QoS-Information AVP within
the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP. The QoS-Information AVP shall not contain a
Bearer-Identifier AVP.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to QCI, authorised MBR per QCI is supplied.
In such a case the authorized QoS shall be provisioned outside a Charging-
Rule-Definition AVP at the command level. This case applies only for IP-CAN
types that support non-GBR bearers that have a separate MBR (i.e. 3GPP-GPRS
access). Its applicability is specified in annex A.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to an APN, authorised APN-Aggregate-Max-
Bitrate UL/DL is supplied. In such a case the authorized QoS shall be
provisioned outside a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP at command level.
\- When the authorized QoS applies to the default EPS bearer it shall be
provisioned within the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP.
Authorized QoS at IP-CAN bearer level is access specific. See Annex A for
further details.
The authorized QoS provides appropriate values for the resources to be
enforced.
The authorized QoS for a PCC rule is a request for allocating the
corresponding resources, and the authorized QoS for a QCI is a request for an
upper limit for the MBR that the PCEF assigns to non-GBR bearers with that
QCI.
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per PCC rule is a part of PCC rule
provisioning procedure.
If the PCEF cannot allocate any of the resources as authorized by the PCRF,
the PCEF informs the PCRF and acts as described in Clause 4.5.12 PCC Rule
Error handling.
The PCEF is responsible for enforcing the policy based authorization.
QoS authorization information may be dynamically provisioned by the PCRF or it
can be a pre-defined PCC rule in the PCEF. Moreover, all the parameters of the
authorized QoS can be changed, but no order is defined for QCI.
NOTE 1: A change of QCIs cannot be described as an upgrade or downgrade and
also no QCI can be referred to as the higher or lower.Whether the QCI is
permitted to be changed or not is subject to both operator policies and normal
restrictions on changing from a non-GBR QCI value to GBR QCI value on a
default bearer.
NOTE 2: All attributes of the ARP QoS parameter can be changed but only the
ARP priority level represents an ordered range of values. The ARP priority
level attribute represents the actual priority for the service/user with the
value 1 as the highest and can thus be upgraded and downgraded.
The PCEF shall make sure that the total QoS information of the PCC rules for
one IP-CAN bearer does not exceed the authorized QoS information, i.e. the
information received from the PCRF.
If the PCRF is unable to make a decision for the response to the CC-Request by
the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the request as described in clause 4.5.1.
#### 4.5.5.0a Provisioning of authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is used if the bearer binding is
performed by the PCRF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]). Provisioning of
authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is access specific. See Annex A for further
details.
#### 4.5.5.1 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The PCEF is responsible for enforcing the policy based authorization, i.e. to
ensure that the requested QoS is in-line with the \"Authorized QoS\" per IP
CAN Bearer. Policy enforcement of authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is access
specific. See Annex A for further details.
#### 4.5.5.2 Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per service data flow is a part of PCC rule
provisioning procedure, as described in clause 4.5.2.0.
The authorized QoS per service data flow shall be provisioned within the
corresponding PCC rule by including the QoS-Information AVP within the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA or RAR commands. This QoS-Information
AVP shall not contain a Bearer-Identifier AVP.
#### 4.5.5.3 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per service data flow
If an authorized QoS is defined for a PCC rule, the PCEF shall limit the data
rate of the service data flow corresponding to that PCC rule not to exceed the
maximum authorized bandwidth for the PCC rule by discarding packets exceeding
the limit.
The PCEF shall reserve the resources necessary for the guaranteed bitrate for
the PCC rule upon receipt of a PCC rule provisioning including QoS
information. For GBR bearers the PCEF should set the bearer\'s GBR to the sum
of the GBRs of all PCC rules that are active/installed and bound to that GBR
bearer. For GBR bearers the PCEF should set the bearer\'s MBR to the sum of
the MBRs of all PCC rules that are active/installed and bound to that GBR
bearer.
NOTE 1: Since the PCRF controls the GBR value in the PCC rule, the PCRF can
prevent that uplink GBR resources are reserved by providing an uplink GBR
value of zero for that PCC rule This may be useful e.g. for a PCC rule with
application identifier as the uplink traffic can be received in other bearers
than the one the PCC rule is bound to.
For non-GBR bearers, when the IP-CAN type supports non-GBR bearers that have a
separate MBR (i.e. 3GPP-GPRS), the PCEF may also set the bearer\'s MBR to the
sum of the MBRs of all PCC rules that are active and bound to that non-GBR
bearer unless that sum exceeds a possibly provisioned authorized QoS per QCI
for the bearer\'s QCI (see clause 4.5.5.6). If an authorized QoS per QCI has
been provisioned for the bearer\'s QCI, the PCEF should set the bearer\'s MBR
to the corresponding MBR. The access-specific BS Manager (as included in 3GPP
TS 29.213 [8]) within the PCEF receives the authorised access-specific QoS
information from the Translation/mapping function. Then the PCEF shall start
the needed procedures to ensure that the provisioned resources are according
to the authorized values. This may imply that the PCEF needs to request the
establishment of new IP CAN bearer(s) or the modification of existing IP CAN
bearer(s). If the enforcement is not successful, the PCEF shall inform the
PCRF as described in clause 4.5.5.0.
Upon deactivation or removal of a PCC rule, the PCEF shall free the resources
reserved for that PCC rule.
#### 4.5.5.4 Coordination of authorized QoS scopes in mixed mode
Coordination of authorized QoS scopes in mixed mode is access specific. See
Annex A for further details.
#### 4.5.5.5 Provisioning of authorized QoS per QCI
When the IP-CAN type supports non-GBR bearers that have a separate MBR (i.e.
3GPP-GPRS) the PCRF may provision an authorized QoS per QCI for non-GBR bearer
QCI values. The PCRF shall not provision an authorized QoS per QCI for GBR
bearer QCI values.
The authorized QoS per QCI shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA command level
using the QoS-Information AVP with the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and the
Maximum-Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVP and/or the Maximum-Requested-Bandwidth-DL
AVP. The Guaranteed Bitrate values shall not be filled up. Multiple QoS-
Information AVPs can be used for assigning authorized QoS for several QCIs
with one command. The authorized QoS per QCI may be provisioned before or in
connection with the activation of the first PCC rule with a certain QCI. The
PCRF may also provision a changed authorized QoS per QCI at any time.
#### 4.5.5.6 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per QCI
The PCEF can receive an authorized QoS per QCI for non GBR-bearer QCI values
for those IP-CAN types that support non-GBR bearers that have a separate MBR
(i.e. 3GPP-GPRS). It sets an upper limit for the MBR that the PCEF may assign
to a non-GBR bearer with that QCI. If the PCEF receives an authorized QoS per
QCI for a non-GBR bearer QCI value, it shall not set a higher MBR for that
bearer than the provisioned MBR. The PCEF should assign the authorized MBR per
QCI to a non-GBR bearer with that QCI to avoid frequent IP-CAN bearer
modifications as PCC rules can be dynamically activated and deactivated.
If multiple IP-CAN bearers within the same IP-CAN session are assigned the
same QCI, the authorized MBR per QCI applies independently to each of those
IP-CAN bearers.
The access-specific BS Manager (as included in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]) within the
PCEF receives the authorized access-specific QoS information from the
Translation/mapping function.
#### 4.5.5.7 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS per APN as part of the IP-CAN
session establishment procedure and may be modified at any time as long as
there is an IP-CAN session active for that APN. The authorized QoS per APN may
be modified as part of the IP-CAN session establishment or modification of any
of the IP-CAN sessions active for a UE within that APN. To do so, the PCRF
shall provision the authorized QoS per APN for each IP-CAN session for that
APN. .
The authorized QoS per APN shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA command level
using the QoS-Information AVP including the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL AVP
and/or the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP. When APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL
AVP and/or the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP are provided, the Max-
Requested-Bandwidth values, and the Guaranteed Bitrate values shall not be
included.
NOTE: The QoS per APN limits the aggregate bit rate of all Non‑GBR bearers of
the same APN, i.e. the GBR bearers are outside the scope of QoS per APN.
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS per APN, based on information
obtained from the SPR or internal policies.
For the case that BBF is located at the PCEF, if the modification of the QoS
per APN fails, the PCEF shall retain the existing QoS per APN without any
modification and send to the PCRF a new CCR command with the Event Trigger set
to APN-AMBR_MODIFICATION_FAILURE providing the retained value within the APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL AVP and/or APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP included
in QoS-Information AVP.
NOTE: The access network can reject the modification of the bearer if the APN-
AMBR does not comply with the roaming agreement. Refer to 3GPP TS 23.401 [32].
#### 4.5.5.8 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per APN
The PCEF shall be able to enforce the AMBR per APN.
The PCEF may receive an authorized QoS per APN at IP-CAN session establishment
and also at IP-CAN session modification. It sets an upper limit for the
bandwidth usage for all the non-GBR bearers for that APN. The PCEF shall limit
to that value the aggregated traffic of all SDFs of the same APN that are
associated with Non-GBR QCIs.
#### 4.5.5.9 Provisioning of authorized QoS for the Default EPS Bearer
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS for the default EPS bearer. The
authorized QoS may be obtained upon interaction with the SPR.
The default EPS bearer QoS information shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA
command level using the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the QoS-Class-
Identifier AVP and the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP. The provided QoS-
Class-Identifier AVP shall include a non-GBR corresponding value.
If the modification of the default EPS bearer QoS information fails, the PCEF
shall retain the existing default EPS bearer QoS without any modification and
send the PCRF a new CCR command and include with Event Trigger set to DEFAULT-
EPS-BEARER-QOS _MODIFICATION_FAILURE providing the retained values within the
Allocation-Retention-PriorityAVP and QoS-Class-Identifier AVP included in
Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP.
NOTE: The access network can reject the modification of the default bearer if
the default beaer QoS does not comply with the roaming agreement. Refer to
3GPP TS 23.401 [32].
#### 4.5.5.10 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS of the Default EPS Bearer
The PCEF may receive the authorized QoS for the default bearer over Gx
interface. The PCEF enforces it which may lead to the change of the subscribed
default EPS Bearer QoS.
### 4.5.6 Indication of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications
This procedure applies to those IP-CAN networks that support multiple bearers.
This procedure applies only to dedicated bearers. For 3GPP-GPRS IP-CAN
network, see annex A.
If the last IP CAN bearer within an IP CAN session is being terminated, the
PCEF shall apply the procedures in clause 4.5.7 to indicate the IP CAN session
termination.
When the PCEF detects that a dedicated IP-CAN bearer could not be activated or
has been terminated it shall remove the affected PCC rules and send a CCR
command to the PCRF with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\", including the Charging-Rule-Report AVP specifying the
affected PCC rules with the PCC-Rule-Status set to inactive and including the
Rule-Failure-Code AVP assigned to the value RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_FAILURE (10).
This shall be done whenever one of these conditions applies:
\- The PCEF is requested by the IP-CAN to initiate the deactivation of a
bearer,
\- PCC rule(s) are removed/deactivated by the PCEF without PCRF request (e.g.
due to unsuccessful reservation of resources to satisfy the bearer binding).
NOTE: The PCEF will not initiate the deactivation of the bearer upon reception
of the UE-initiated resource modification procedure indicating packet filter
deletion. If all the PCC rules associated to a bearer have been deleted as a
consequence of the PCRF interaction, the PCEF will initiate the bearer
termination procedure towards the IP-CAN network.
Signalling flows for the IP-CAN bearer termination and details of the binding
mechanism are presented in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
### 4.5.7 Indication of IP-CAN Session Termination
The PCEF shall contact the PCRF when the IP-CAN session is being terminated.
The PCEF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\".
If the PCEF needs to send an IP-CAN session termination request towards a PCRF
which is known to have restarted since the IP-CAN session establishment, the
PCEF should not send CC-Request to inform the PCRF.
NOTE: When a PCRF is known to have restarted, the PCC contexts and Diameter
sessions affected by the failure are lost in the PCRF, the PCEF does not need
to inform the PCRF for this case.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the PCEF.
NOTE: According to DCC procedures, the Diameter Credit Control session is
being terminated with this message exchange.
Signalling flows for the IP-CAN session termination are presented in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
### 4.5.8 Request of IP-CAN Bearer Termination
This procedure applies to those IP-CAN networks that support multiple bearers.
This procedure applies only to dedicated bearers. For 3GPP-GPRS IP-CAN
network, see annex A.
As a consequence of the removal of PCC rules initiated by the PCRF, the PCEF
may require the termination of an existing bearer. The PCRF may not be aware
that it requests the termination of an IP-CAN bearer by removing certain PCC
rules.
The PCRF may request the removal of the PCC rules by using the PCC rule
provisioning procedures in clause 4.5.2 to remove all PCRF-provisioned PCC
rules and deactivate all PCC rules predefined within the PCEF. The PCRF may
either completely remove these PCC rules from the IP CAN session or reinstall
them (e.g. by changing the QoS or charging information) within the IP CAN
session. When all the PCC rules applied to one bearer have been deleted and/or
deactivated, the PCEF will instantly start the bearer termination procedure.
If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-only, and the PCRF receives a
trigger for the removal of all PCC rules from the AF, the following steps
apply. In order to avoid race conditions, the PCRF should start a timer to
wait for the UE-initiated resource release message. If a UE-initiated resource
release is performed before timer expiry, the PCRF will receive an Indication
of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications according to clause 4.5.6 and shall
then not perform the removal of the PCC rules. Otherwise, if the timer
expires, the PCRF shall remove/deactivate the affected PCC rules that have
been previously installed/activated.
If the selected BCM is UE-only, and the PCRF decides to remove one or more PCC
rules due to an internal trigger or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall
instantly remove/deactivate the affected PCC rules that have been previously
installed/activated.
If the selected BCM is UE/NW, and the PCRF removes/deactivates at the PCEF,
all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN bearer (due to any trigger), the PCEF shall
instantly start the procedures to terminate the related IP-CAN bearer.
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN bearer, the PCEF shall apply IP
CAN specific procedures to terminate the IP CAN bearer, if such procedures
exist for this IP CAN type.
### 4.5.9 Request of IP-CAN Session Termination
If the PCRF decides to terminate an IP CAN session due to an internal trigger
or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall send an RAR command including the
Session-Release-Cause AVP to the PCEF. The PCEF shall acknowledge the command
by sending an RAA command to the PCRF and instantly remove/deactivate all the
PCC rules that have been previously installed or activated on that IP-CAN
session.
The PCEF shall apply IP CAN specific procedures to terminate the IP CAN
session. Furthermore, the PCEF shall apply the indication of IP CAN Session
Termination procedure in clause 4.5.7.
See Annex A for 3GPP-GPRS access type.
### 4.5.10 Bearer Control Mode Selection
The PCEF may indicate, via the Gx reference point, a request for Bearer
Control Mode (BCM) selection at IP-CAN session establishment or IP-CAN session
modification (e.g. as a consequence of an SGSN change). It will be done using
the PCC rule request procedure.
NOTE 1: For the cases where Gxx is deployed in the network, the Bearer Control
Mode selection may occur either in the Gxx reference point or Gx reference
point, depending on the IP-CAN type. See access specific annexes.
When applicable for the IP-CAN type, if information about the support of
network-initiated procedures is available, the PCEF shall supply at IP-CAN
Session Establishment, the Network-Request-Support AVP in the CC-Request with
a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\". At IP-CAN Session
Modification, the PCEF shall supply, if available, the Network-Request-Support
AVP in the CC-Request with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\". The Network-Request-Support AVP indicates the access
network support of the network requested bearer control.
The PCRF derives the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy. If the selected bearer control mode is UE_NW,
the PCRF shall decide what mode (UE or NW) shall apply for every PCC rule.
NOTE 2: For operator-controlled services, the UE and the PCRF may be
provisioned with information indicating which mode is to be used.
When applicable for the IP-CAN type, the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP
shall be provided to the PCEF using the PCC Rules provision procedure at IP-
CAN session establishment. The selected value will be applicable for the whole
IP-CAN session.
When the bearer binding function is changed from the BBERF to the PCEF, the
PCEF may indicate, via the Gx reference point, a request for Bearer Control
Mode (BCM) selection at IP-CAN session modification as described above.
NOTE 3: The bearer binding function can be changed from the BBERF to the PCEF
when the UE moves from a case 2a) system or a case 2b) system to a case 1)
system (see 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]).
### 4.5.11 Provisioning of Event Report Indication
For the cases where Gxa and/or Gxc are deployed in the network, the PCEF may
indicate the PCRF to be informed about specific changes occurred in the access
network. In this case, the PCRF shall subscribe to the appropriate event
triggers in the BBERF according to clause 4a.5.8. After receiving the reply of
the event subscription from the BBERF, the PCRF shall send the event related
information to the PCEF by using a RAR command. The Event Report concept is
defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] clause 3.1.
When PCRF is notified that an event is triggered in the BBERF, if the PCEF has
previously requested to be informed of the specific event, the PCRF shall
notify the PCEF about the event occurred together with additional related
information. This notification will be done by using the Event-Report-
Indication AVP. There may be neither PCC Rule provisioning nor Event Trigger
provisioning together with event report indication in this message.
Whenever the PCEF subscribes to an event report indication by using the CCR
command, the PCRF shall only send the corresponding currently applicable
values which have been updated (e.g. 3GPP-User-Location-Info, 3GPP2-BSID,
etc.) to the PCEF in the CCA if available. In this case, the Event-Trigger
AVPs shall not be included.
NOTE: The PCRF can get the currently applicable values during the IP-CAN
session establishment procedure or during the information reporting from the
BBERF when the BBERF gets event subscription from the PCRF as defined in
clause 5.3.7.
When multiple BBERFs exist as in flow mobility case, the PCEF may subscribe to
different event triggers at different BBERFs. In this case, the PCEF shall
include the Routing-IP-Address AVP within the Event-Report-Indication AVP to
identify the BBERF for which the event triggers are to be installed. If the
PCEF did not include Routing-IP-Address AVP within the Event-Report-Indication
AVP, then the Event-Report-Indication AVP applies to all the BBERFs and the
same event triggers will be installed on all of them.
### 4.5.12 PCC Rule Error Handling
If the installation/activation of one or more PCC rules fails, the PCEF shall
include one or more Charging-Rule-Report AVP(s) in either a CCR or an RAA
command as described below for the affected PCC rules. Within each Charging-
Rule-Report AVP, the PCEF shall identify the failed PCC rule(s) by including
the Charging-Rule-Name AVP(s) or Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP(s), shall
identify the failed reason code by including a Rule-Failure-Code AVP, and
shall include the PCC-Rule-Status AVP as described below:
\- If the installation/activation of one or more PCC rules fails using a PUSH
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using RAR command), the PCEF
shall communicate the failure to the PCRF in the RAA response to the RAR if
the validation of the PCC Rule was unsuccessful or in a CCR command if the
resource allocation for the PCC Rule was unsuccessful.
\- If the installation/activation of one or more PCC rules fails using a PULL
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using a CCA command) the PCEF
shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and include the Rule-Failure-Code AVP.
If the installation/activation of one or more new PCC rules (i.e., rules which
were not previously successfully installed) fails, the PCEF shall set the PCC-
Rule-Status to INACTIVE for both the PUSH and the PULL modes.
The removal of a PCC rule shall not fail, even if the IP-CAN session
procedures with the UE fail. The PCEF shall retain information on the removal
and conduct the necessary IP-CAN session procedures with the UE when it is
possible.
If the modification of a currently active PCC rule using PUSH mode fails, the
PCEF shall retain the existing PCC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing PCC rule.
The PCEF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the RAA
command when the validation of the PCC Rule installation was unsuccessful or
using the CCR command when the resource allocation for the corresponding PCC
Rule was unsuccessful.
If the modification of a currently active PCC rule using PULL mode fails, the
PCEF shall retain the existing PCC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing PCC rule.
The PCEF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the CCR
command.
Depending on the value of the Rule-Failure-Code for PULL and PUSH mode, the
PCRF may decide whether retaining of the old PCC rule, re-installation,
modification, removal of the PCC rule or any other action applies.
If a PCC rule was successfully installed/activated, but can no longer be
enforced by the PCEF, the PCEF shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and
include a Charging-Rule-Report AVP. The PCEF shall include the Rule-Failure-
Code AVP within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP and shall set the PCC-Rule-Status
to INACTIVE.
NOTE: When the PCRF receives PCC-Rule-Status set to INACTIVE, the PCRF does
not need request the PCEF to remove the inactive PCC rule.
### 4.5.13 Time of the day procedures
PCEF shall be able to perform PCC rule request as instructed by the PCRF. To
do so, the PCRF shall provide the Event-Trigger AVP with the value
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT (17) if the event trigger is not previously set, and in
addition the Revalidation-Time AVP when set by the PCRF. This shall cause the
PCEF to trigger a PCRF interaction to request PCC rules from the PCRF for an
established IP CAN session. The PCEF shall stop the timer once the PCEF
triggers an REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event. The PCEF should send the PCC rule
request during a preconfigured period before the indicated revalidation time.
NOTE 1: The PCRF is expected to be prepared to provide a new policy, as
desired for the revalidation time, during a preconfigured period before the
revalidation time.The preconfigured periods in the PCEF and PCRF need to be
alignedPCRF shall be able to provide a new value for the revalidation timeout
by including Revalidation-Time AVP in CCA or RAR. The PCRF may provide the
Revalidation-Time AVP together with the event trigger REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT or
in a subsequent PCC rule provisioning.
PCRF shall be able to stop the revalidation timer by disabling the
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event trigger.
NOTE 2: By disabling the REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT the revalidation time value
previously provided to the PCEF is not applicable anymore.
The PCRF may control at what time the status of a PCC rule changes.
1) If Rule-Activation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the PCEF shall set the PCC rule inactive and make it active at that time. If
Rule-Activation-Time has passed, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC
rule active.
2) If Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the PCEF shall set the PCC rule active and make it inactive at that time. If
Rule-Deactivation-Time has passed, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC
rule inactive.
3) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, and also
when the PCC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, the PCEF shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then as
defined in 2).
4) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, and also
when the PCC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Activation-Time, the PCEF shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as
defined in 1).
5) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has already occurred for both, and the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before
the Rule-Deactivation-Time, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC rule
inactive.
6) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the
Rule-Activation-Time, then the PCEF shall immediately set the PCC rule active.
PCC Rule Activation or Deactivation will not generate any CCR commands with
Charging-Rule-Report since PCRF is already aware of the state of the rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified in the
Charging-Rule-Install then it will replace the previously set values for the
specified PCC rules. If Rule-Activation-Time AVP, Rule-Deactivation-Time AVP
or both AVPs are omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is no
longer valid.
The 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available, may be used by the PCRF to derive the
Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time.
If the PCC rule(s) that include the Rule-Activation-Time AVP are bound to a
bearer that will require traffic mapping information to be sent to the UE, the
PCEF shall report the failure to the PCRF by including the Charging-Rule-
Report AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code set the value \"NO_BEARER_BOUND (15)\"
for the affected PCC rule(s) identified by the Charing-Rule-Name AVP in either
a CCR or an RAA command.
NOTE 3: This limitation prevents dependencies on the signalling of changed
traffic mapping information towards the UE.
The PCC rules including Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time shall
not be applied for changes of the QoS or service data flow filter information.
The PCRF may modify a currently installed PCC rule, including setting,
modifying or clearing its deferred activation and/or deactivation time. When
modifying a dynamic PCC rule with a prior and/or new deferred activation
and/or deactivation time, the PCRF shall provide all attributes of that rule
in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP, including attributes that have not
changed.
NOTE 4: In this case, the PCRF omission of an attribute that has a prior value
will erase that attribute from the PCC rule.
### 4.5.14 Trace activation/deactivation
Trace activation/deactivation at the P-GW takes place via the PCRF and is
3GPP-EPS access specific. See Annex B for further information.
### 4.5.15 IMS Emergency Session Support
#### 4.5.15.1 Functional Entities
The PCRF shall store a configurable list of Emergency APNs that are valid for
the operator to which the PCRF belongs to.
For emergency APNs, the IMSI may not be present. The PCEF, BBERF and PCRF
shall support request for PCC/QoS Rules that do not include an IMSI.
#### 4.5.15.2 PCC procedures for Emergency services over Gx reference point
##### 4.5.15.2.1 Request for PCC Rules for Emergency services
The PCEF executes the same procedure as for a Request for PCC Rules unrelated
to Emergency Services described in clause 4.5.1.
A PCEF that requests PCC Rules at IP-CAN Session Establishment shall send a
CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the
Called-Station-Id AVP including the Emergency APN. The PCEF may include the
IMSI within the Subscription-Id AVP and if the IMSI is not available the PCEF
shall include the IMEI within the User-Equipment-Info AVP. The PCEF may
include the rest of the attributes described in clause 4.5.1.
Any PCEF-initiated requests for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service that
include the \"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\" Event-Trigger AVP shall be
rejected by the PCRF with the error
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
If the PCRF detects that the initial or subsequent CCR command shall be
rejected, it shall execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental
result code described in clause 4.5.1.
##### 4.5.15.2.2 Provisioning of PCC Rules for Emergency services
###### 4.5.15.2.2.1 Provisioning of PCC Rules at Gx session establishment
The PCRF shall detect that a Gx session is restricted to IMS Emergency
services when a CCR command is received with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the Called-Station-Id AVP includes a PDN
identifier that matches one of the Emergency APNs from the configurable list.
The PCRF:
\- shall provision PCC Rules restricting the access to Emergency Services
(e.g. P-CSCF(s), DHCP(s) and DNS (s) and SUPL(s) addresses) as required by
local operator policies in a CCA command according to the procedures described
in clause 4.5.2.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to the default EPS bearer
within the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP in a CCA command according to the
procedures described in clause 4.5.5.10 except for obtaining the authorized
QoS upon interaction with the SPR. The value for the Priority-Level AVP shall
be assigned as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an IMS Emergency
session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a value that is
reserved for an operator domain use of IMS Emergency sessions). If the IP-CAN-
Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" or \"3GPP-GPRS\" the values for Pre-
emption-Capability AVP and the Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall be assigned
as required by local operator policies.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to an APN within the APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate UL/DL in a CCA command according to the procedures
described in clause 4.5.5.7.
\- shall always assign NW mode to the PCC Rules that are bound to an IP-CAN
session restricted to Emergency services.
When the PCEF detects that the provisioning of PCC Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4.5.2.
###### 4.5.15.2.2.2 Provisioning of PCC Rules for Emergency Services
When the PCRF receives IMS service information from the AF for an Emergency
service and derives authorized PCC Rules from the service information, the
Priority-Level AVP in the QoS information within the PCC Rule shall be
assigned a priority as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an IMS
Emergency session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a value
that is reserved for an operator domain use of IMS Emergency session). If the
IP-CAN Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" or \"3GPP-GPRS\" and the Pre-
emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP were received within
the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP in the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP in the
initial CCR command, the values of the Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-
emption-Vulnerability AVP shall also be assigned as required by local operator
policies.
The PCRF shall immediately initiate a PUSH procedure as described in clause
4.5.2.0 to provision PCC Rules and the procedures described in clause 4.5.5.2
to provision the authorized QoS per service data flow.
The provisioning of PCC Rules at the PCEF that require the establishment of a
dedicated bearer for emergency services shall cancel the inactivity timer in
the PCEF, if running.
Any PCEF-initiated request for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service
triggered by Event-Trigger AVP assigned to \"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\"
(i.e. UE-initiated resource reservation) shall be rejected by the PCRF with
the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED. If the Bearer Control
Mode is assigned to \"UE_ONLY\" and the PCRF receives a request for PCC Rules
that are associated with an Emergency service, it shall provision PCC Rules as
described in clause 4.5.2 and the authorized QoS per service data flow as
described in clause 4.5.2.2.
The PCEF shall execute the procedures described in clause 4.5.2.0 and clause
4.5.5.3 to ensure that a new IP-CAN bearer is established for the Emergency
service.
When the PCEF detects that the provisioning of PCC Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4.5.12.
##### 4.5.15.2.3 Removal of PCC Rules for Emergency Services
The reception of a request to terminate an AF session for an IMS Emergency
service by the PCRF triggers the removal of PCC Rules assigned to the
terminated IMS Emergency Service from the PCEF by using a RAR command with
Charging-Rule-Remove AVP including the removed PCC Rules.
At reception of a RAR that removes one or several PCC Rules from an IP-CAN
Session restricted to emergency services the PCEF shall:
\- when all PCC Rules bound to an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer termination procedure as defined in clause 4.5.8.
\- when not all PCC Rule bound an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer modification procedure as defined in clause 4.5.2 and clause
4.5.5.1.
In addition, the PCEF shall initiate an inactivity timer if all PCC Rules with
a QCI other than the default bearer QCI or the QCI used for IMS signalling
were removed from the IP-CAN session restricted to Emergency Services. When
the inactivity timer expires the PCEF shall initiate an IP-CAN session
termination procedure as defined in clause 4.5.7.
##### 4.5.15.2.4 Removal of PCC Rules at Gx session termination
The reception of a request to terminate the IP-CAN session restricted to IMS
Emergency session shall trigger the termination of the Gx session for IMS
Emergency session as defined in clause 4.5.7.
### 4.5.16 Requesting Usage Monitoring Control
The PCRF may indicate, via the Gx reference point, the need to apply
monitoring control for the accumulated usage of network resources on an IP-CAN
session basis. Usage is defined as volume of user plane traffic. The data
collection for usage monitoring control shall be performed per monitoring key,
which may apply for a single Service Data Flow, a set of Service Data Flows or
for all the traffic in an IP-CAN session.
If the PCRF requests usage monitoring control and if at this time, the PCRF is
not subscribed to the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger, the PCRF shall include
the Event-Trigger AVP, set to the value \"USAGE_REPORT\", in a CC-Answer or
RA-Request. The PCRF shall not remove the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger AVP
while usage monitoring is still active in the PCEF.
At IP-CAN session establishment and modification, the PCRF may provide the
applicable thresholds for usage monitoring control to the PCEF, together with
the respective monitoring keys. To provide the initial threshold for one or
more monitoring key(s), the PCRF may include the threshold in either RA-
Request or in the response of a CC-Request initiated by the PCEF.
During the IP-CAN session establishment, the PCRF may receive information
about total allowed usage per PDN and/ or per UE from the SPR, i.e. the
overall amount of allowed traffic volume that are to be monitored for the PDN
connections of a user and/or total allowed usage for Monitoring key(s) per PDN
and UE.
NOTE: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in
this Release.
In order to provide the applicable threshold for usage monitoring control, the
PCRF shall include a Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key. The
threshold level shall be provided in its Granted-Service-Unit AVP. Threshold
levels may be defined for:
\- the total volume only; or
\- the uplink volume only; or
\- the downlink volume only; or
\- the uplink and downlink volume.
The PCRF shall provide the applicable threshold(s) in the CC-Total-Octets, CC-
Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVPs of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP. The
monitoring key shall be provided in the Monitoring-Key AVP. The PCRF may
provide multiple usage monitoring control instances. The PCRF shall indicate
if the usage monitoring instance applies to the IP-CAN session or to one or
more PCC rules. For this purpose, the Usage-Monitoring-Level AVP may be
provided with a value respectively set to SESSION_LEVEL or PCC_RULE_LEVEL. The
PCRF may provide one usage monitoring control instance applicable at IP-CAN
session level and one or more usage monitoring instances applicable at PCC
Rule level.
The PCRF may provide a Monitoring-Time AVP to the PCEF for the monitoring
keys(s) in order to receive reports for the accumulated usage before and after
the monitoring time occurs within the report triggered by the events defined
in 4.5.17.1-4.5.17.5. In such a case, there may be two instances of Granted-
Service-Unit AVP within Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key.
One of them indicates the threshold levels before the monitoring time occurs,
and the other one, which includes Monitoring-Time AVP, indicates the
subsequent threshold levels after the monitoring time occurs. The detailed
functionality in such a case is defined by 4.5.17.6.
If the PCRF wishes to modify the threshold level for one or more monitoring
keys, the PCRF shall provide the thresholds for all the different levels
applicable to the corresponding monitoring key(s).
If the PCRF wishes to modify the monitoring key for the session level usage
monitoring instance, it shall disable the existing session level monitoring
usage instance following the procedures defined in 4.5.17.3 and shall provide
a new session level usage monitoring instance following the procedures defined
in this clause. The PCRF may enable the new session level usage monitoring
instance and disable the existing session level usage monitoring instance in
the same command.
When the accumulated usage is reported in a CCR command, the PCRF shall
indicate to the PCEF if usage monitoring shall continue for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as follows:
\- If monitoring shall continue for specific level(s), the PCRF shall provide
the new thresholds for the level(s) in the CC-Answer using the same AVP as
before (CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVP within the
Granted-Service-Unit AVP); - otherwise, if the PCRF wishes to stop monitoring
for specific level(s) the PCRF shall not include an updated usage threshold in
the CCA command for the stopped level(s) i.e. the corresponding CC-Total-
Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVPs shall not be included within
Granted-Service-Units AVP.
When usage monitoring is enabled, the PCRF may request the PCEF to report
accumulated usage for one or more enabled monitoring keys regardless if a
usage threshold has been reached by sending to the PCEF within the Usage-
Monitoring-Information AVP the Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to the value
USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED. The PCRF shall only require PCEF to report
accumulated usage for one or more monitoring keys in a CC-Answer when the PCEF
has not provided accumulated usage in the CC-Request for the same monitoring
key(s).
To specify the usage monitoring key for which usage is requested the PCRF
shall include the usage monitoring key within the Monitoring-Key AVP within
the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. To request usage be reported for all
enabled usage monitoring keys the PCRF shall omit the Monitoring-Key.
The PCRF shall process the usage reports and shall perform the actions as
appropriate for each report.
### 4.5.17 Reporting Accumulated Usage
#### 4.5.17.0 General
When usage monitoring is enabled, the PCEF shall measure the volume of the IP-
CAN session or the volume of the applicable service data flows and report
accumulated usage to the PCRF in the following conditions:
\- when a usage threshold is reached;
\- when all PCC rules for which usage monitoring is enabled for a particular
usage monitoring key are removed or deactivated;
\- when usage monitoring is explicitly disabled by the PCRF;
\- when an IP-CAN session is terminated;
\- when requested by the PCRF;
To report accumulated usage for a specific monitoring key the PCEF shall send
a CC-Request with the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
accumulated usage since the last report. For each of the enabled monitoring
keys to be reported, the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP shall include the
monitoring key in the Monitoring-Key AVP and the accumulated volume usage in
the Used-Service-Unit AVP. Accumulated volume reporting shall be done for the
total volume, the uplink volume or the downlink volume as requested by the
PCRF, and set in CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVPs of
Used-Service-Unit AVP respectively. The PCEF shall continue to perform volume
measurement after the report until instructed by the PCRF to stop the
monitoring.
In case a Monitoring-Time AVP was provided by the PCRF within one instance of
the Granted-Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information
AVP for the usage monitoring control request, the PCEF shall report as defined
in 4.5.17.6.
For cases where the PCRF indicates in a CC-Answer command whether the usage
monitoring shall continue as a response to the reporting of accumulated usage
in a CCR command, the PCEF shall behave as follows
\- if the PCRF provisions an updated usage threshold in the CCA command, the
monitoring continues using the updated threshold value provisioned by the
PCRF;
\- otherwise, if the PCRF does not include an updated usage threshold in the
CCA command, the PCEF shall not continue usage monitoring for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as applicable.
NOTE: When the PCRF indicates that usage monitoring shall not continue in the
CCA, the PCEF does not report usage which has accumulated between sending the
CCR and receiving the CCA.
Upon receiving the reported usage from the PCEF, the PCRF shall deduct the
value of the usage report from the total allowed usage for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as applicable, and the PCRF may also
derive the PCC rules based on the remaining allowed usage or reported usage
and provision them to the PCEF.
Additional procedures for each of the scenarios above are described in the
following clauses of 4.5.17.
#### 4.5.17.1 Usage Threshold Reached
When usage monitoring is enabled for a particular monitoring key, the PCEF
shall measure the volume of all traffic for the IP-CAN session or the
corresponding service data flows and notify the PCRF when a usage threshold
for that monitoring key is reached and report the accumulated usage for that
monitoring key and include the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger in a CCR command
with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\" by following the
procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause 4.5.17.
#### 4.5.17.2 PCC Rule Removal
When the PCRF removes or deactivates the last PCC rule associated with a usage
monitoring key in an RAR or CCA command in response to a CCR command not
related to reporting usage for the same monitoring key, the PCEF shall send a
new CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\"
including the Event-Trigger set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report accumulated
usage for the usage monitoring key within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP
using the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause 4.5.17.
When the PCEF reports that the last PCC rule associated with a usage
monitoring key is inactive, the PCEF shall report the accumulated usage for
that monitoring key within the same CCR command if the Charging-Rule-Report
AVP was included in a CCR command; otherwise, if the Charging-Rule-Report AVP
was included in an RAA command, the PCEF shall send a new CCR command to
report accumulated usage for the usage monitoring key.
#### 4.5.17.3 Usage Monitoring Disabled
Once enabled, the PCRF may explicitly disable usage monitoring as a result of
receiving a CCR from the PCEF which is not related to reporting usage, other
external triggers (e.g., receiving an AF request, subscriber profile update),
or a PCRF internal trigger. When the PCRF disables usage monitoring, the PCEF
shall report the accumulated usage which has occurred while usage monitoring
was enabled since the last report.
To disable usage monitoring for a monitoring key, the PCRF shall send the
Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including only the applicable monitoring key
within the Monitoring-Key AVP and the Usage-Monitoring-Support AVP set to
USAGE_MONITORING_DISABLED.
When the PCRF disables usage monitoring in a RAR or CCA command, the PCEF
shall send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report
accumulated usage for the disabled usage monitoring key(s).
#### 4.5.17.4 IP-CAN Session Termination
At IP-CAN session termination the PCEF shall send the accumulated usage
information for all monitoring keys for which usage monitoring is enabled in
the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" using the procedures to report accumulated usage
defined in clause 4.5.17.
If all IP-CAN sessions of a user to the same APN are terminated, the PCRF may
store the remaining allowed usage, i.e. the information about the remaining
overall amount of resources, in the SPR.
#### 4.5.17.5 PCRF Requested Usage Report
When the PCEF receives the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to the value USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED,
the PCEF shall send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the
value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to
report accumulated usage for the monitoring key received in the Usage-
Monitoring-Information AVP using the procedures to report accumulated usage
defined in clause 4.5.17. If the Monitoring-Key AVP was omitted in the
received Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP, the PCEF shall send the accumulated
usage for all the monitoring keys that were enabled at the time the Usage-
Monitoring-Information was received.
#### 4.5.17.6 Report in case of Monitoring Time provided
If Monitoring-Time AVP was provided within one instance of the Granted-
Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP by the
PCRF, and if the PCEF needs to report the accumulated usage when one of the
events defined in clause 4.5.17.1-4.5.17.5 occurs before the monitoring time,
the PCEF shall report the accumulated usage as defined in clause
4.5.17.1-4.5.17.5 and the PCEF shall not retain the monitoring time;
otherwise,
\- If two instances of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP are provided by the PCRF,
the PCEF shall reset the usage threshold to the value of the Granted-Service-
Unit AVP with the Monitoring-Time AVP.
\- If only one instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP is provided by the
PCRF, the PCEF shall reset the usage threshold to the remaining value of the
Granted-Service-Unit AVP previously sent by the PCRF (i.e. excluding the
accumulated volume usage).
\- For both cases, the usage report from the PCEF shall include two instances
of the Used-Service-Unit AVP, one of them to indicate the usage before the
monitoring time and the other one accompanied by the Monitoring-Time AVP under
the same Used-Service-Unit AVP to indicate the usage after the monitoring
time.
When the PCRF receives the accumulated usage report in a CCR command, the PCRF
shall indicate to the PCEF if usage monitoring shall continue as defined in
clause 4.5.16. The PCRF may provide the Monitoring-Time AVP again within one
instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP if reports for the accumulated usage
before and after the provided monitoring time are required.
### 4.5.18 IMS Restoration Support
In order to support IMS Restoration procedures (refer to 3GPP TS 23.380 [33]),
PCRF needs to convey the AF address to the PCEF. In order to do so, in case AF
provisions information about the AF signalling flows between the UE and the
AF, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] Section 4.4.5a, the PCRF shall install
the corresponding dynamic PCC rules (if not installed before) by triggering a
RAR message. The PCRF shall provide the Charging-Rule-Install AVP including
the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP(s). The Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall
include in the Flow-Information AVP the signalling flows between UE and the
AF. The Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall also include the AF-Signalling-
Protocol AVP set to the value corresponding to the signalling protocol used
between the UE and the AF.
The PCEF shall acknowledge the command by sending an RAA command to the PCRF
and shall initiate the corresponding bearer procedure if required. The PCEF
shall extract the AF address from the PCC rules and use it for the monitoring
procedure as defined for the different access types. See Annex A & B.
NOTE: The PCEF will use the AF-Signalling-Protocol AVP to check if, for the
applicable protocol, monitoring procedure has to be started for the AF address
included in the PCC Rules.
In case AF de-provisions information about the AF signalling flows between the
UE and the AF, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] Section 4.4.5a, the PCRF
shall remove the corresponding dynamic PCC rules by triggering a RAR message.
The PCRF shall provide the Charging-Rule-Remove AVP including the
corresponding Charging-Rule-Name AVP(s).
The PCEF shall acknowledge the command by sending a RAA command to the PCRF.
The PCEF shall stop the monitoring procedure for the AF address included in
the removed PCC rule.
### 4.5.19 Multimedia Priority Support
#### 4.5.19.1 PCC Procedures for Multimedia Priority services over Gx
reference point
##### 4.5.19.1.1 Provisioning of PCC Rules for Multimedia Priority Services
The provision of PCC Rules corresponding to both MPS and non-MPS service shall
be performed as described in clause 4.5.2.0.
When the PCRF derives PCC Rules corresponding to MPS service, the ARP and QCI
shall be set as appropriate for the prioritized service, e.g. an IMS
Multimedia Priority Service.
When the PCRF derives PCC Rules corresponding to non-MPS service, the PCRF
shall generate the PCC Rules as per normal procedures. At the time the
Priority EPS Service is invoked (i.e.MPS EPS Priority and MPS Priority Level
are set), the PCRF shall upgrade the ARP and/or change QCI also for the PCC
Rules corresponding to non-MPS service. The PCRF shall change the ARP and/or
QCI modified for the Priority EPS Bearer service to an appropriate value
according to PCRF decision.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the PCRF shall check whether any of these parameters is
stored in the SPR: MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling
Priority. The PCRF shall derive the applicable PCC rules and default bearer
QoS based on that information. If the IMS Signalling Priority is set and the
Called-Station-Id AVP corresponds to an APN dedicated for IMS, the PCRF shall
assign an ARP corresponding to MPS for the default bearer and for the PCC
Rules corresponding to the IMS signalling bearer. If the Called-Station-Id AVP
does not correspond to an APN dedicated for IMS, the ARP shall be derived
without considering IMS Signalling Priority.
NOTE: Subscription data for MPS is provided to PCRF through the Sp reference
point.
Once the PCRF receives a notification of a change in MPS EPS Priority, MPS
Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling Priority from the SPR, the PCRF shall
make the corresponding policy decisions (i.e. ARP and/or QCI change) and, if
applicable, shall initiate a RAR command to provision the modified data.
NOTE 1: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 2: The MPS Priority Level is one among other input data such as operator
policy for the PCRF to set the ARP.
##### 4.5.19.1.2 Invocation/Revocation of Priority EPS Bearer Services
When a Priority EPS Bearer Service is invoked, the PCRF shall
\- Derive the corresponding PCC Rules with the ARP and QCI set as appropriate
for a prioritized service.
\- Set the ARP and QCI of the default bearer as appropriate for a Priority EPS
Bearer Service.
\- Set the ARP and QCI of PCC Rules installed before the activation of the
Priority EPS Bearer Service to the ARP and QCI as appropriate for the Priority
EPS Bearer Service.
When a Priority EPS Bearer Service is revoked, the PCRF shall
\- Delete the PCC Rules corresponding to the Priority EPS Bearer Service if
they were previously provided.
\- Set the ARP and QCI of the default bearer to the normal ARP and QCI.
\- Set the ARP and QCI of all active PCC Rules as appropriate for the PCRF.
NOTE: The activation/deactivation of a Priority EPS Bearer Service requires
explicit invocation/revocation via SPR MPS user profile (MPS EPS Priority, MPS
Priority Level). An AF for MPS Priority Service can also be used to provide
Priority EPS Bearer Services using network-initiated resource allocation
procedures (via interaction with PCC) for originating accesses.
The PCRF shall provision the PCEF with the applicable PCC Rules upon Priority
EPS Bearer Service activation and deactivation as described in clause 4.5.2.0.
The provision of the QoS information applicable for the PCC Rules shall be
performed as described in clause 4.5.5.2. The provision of QoS information for
the default bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4.5.5.9.
##### 4.5.19.1.3 Invocation/Revocation of IMS Multimedia Priority Services
If the PCRF receives service information including an MPS session indication
and the service priority level from the P-CSCF or at reception of the
indication that IMS Signalling Priority is active for the IP-CAN session, the
PCRF shall:
\- set the ARP of the default bearer as appropriate for the prioritized
service;
\- if required, set the ARP of all PCC rules assigned to the IMS signalling
bearer as appropriate for IMS Multimedia Priority Services;
\- derive the PCC Rules corresponding to the IMS Multimedia Priority Service
and set the ARP of these PCC Rules based on the information received over Rx.
If the PCRF detects that the P-CSCF released all the MPS session and the IMS
Signalling Priority has been deactivated for the IP-CAN session the PCRF shall
\- delete the PCC Rules corresponding to the IMS Multimedia Priority Service;
\- set the ARP of the default bearer as appropriate for the IMS Multimedia
Priority set to inactive;
\- replace the ARP of all PCC Rules assigned to the IMS signalling bearer as
appropriate when the IMS Multimedia Priority is inactive.
The PCRF shall provision the PCEF with the applicable PCC Rules upon MPS
session initiation and release as described in clause 4.5.2.0. The provision
of the QoS information applicable for the PCC Rules shall be performed as
described in clause 4.5.5.2. The provision of QoS information for the default
bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4.5.5.9.
### 4.5.20 Sponsored Data Connectivity
Sponsored data connectivity may be performed for service data flows associated
with one or more PCC rules if the information about the sponsor, the
application service provider and optionally the threshold values are provided
by the AF.
The provisioning of sponsored data connectivity per PCC rule shall be
performed using the PCC rule provisioning procedure. The sponsor identity
shall be set using the Sponsor-Identity AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Definition AVP of the PCC rule. The application service provider identity
shall be set using the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP within the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP of the PCC rule. Sponsor-Identity AVP and
Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP shall be included if the Reporting-
Level AVP is set to the value SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL.
When receiving the usage thresholds from the AF, the PCRF shall use the
sponsor identity to generate a monitoring key and request usage monitoring
control for the monitoring key by following the procedures specified in
subclauses 4.5.2.5 and 4.5.16.
### 4.5.21 PCRF Failure and Restoration
If the PCEF needs to send an IP-CAN session modification request towards a
PCRF which is known to have restarted since the IP-CAN session establishment,
the PCEF should not send the IP-CAN session modification request towards a
PCRF and the PCEF may tear down the associated PDN connection based on
operator policy, by initiating PDN connection deactivation procedure.
Emergency and eMPS sessions should not be torn down.
NOTE 1: This mechanism enables the clean up of PDN connections affected by the
PCRF failure and leads the UE to initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure for the same APN.
NOTE 2: The method the PCEF uses to determine that a PCRF has restarted is not
specified in this release.
### 4.5.22 Reporting Access Network Information
If the AF requests the PCRF to report the access network information and if
the PCRF cannot determine that access network information cannot be provided
as described in clause 5.5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall provide
the requested access network information indication (e.g. user location and/or
user timezone information) to the PCEF as follows:
\- If the PCRF is installing or modifying a PCC rule, the PCRF shall include
the Required-Access-Info AVP within the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP of an
appropriate installed or modified PCC rule;
\- Otherwise, if the PCRF is removing PCC rules based on the AF requests, the
PCRF shall include the Required-Access-Info AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Remove AVP associated with the corresponding PCC rules being removed.
The PCRF shall also provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger
within Event-Trigger AVP (if this event trigger is not yet set).
For those PCC Rule(s) based on preliminary service information as described in
3GPP TS 29.214 [10] the PCRF may assign the QCI and ARP of the default bearer
to avoid signalling to the UE. These PCC Rules shall not include the Packet-
Filter-Usage AVP within the Flow-Information AVP included in the Charging-
Rule-Definition AVP.
NOTE: 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] provides further information about appropriate PCC
rules in clause 6.2.1.0.
If the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, upon installation,
modification and removal of any PCC rule(s) with the Required-Access-Info AVP
in a Gx RAR command, the PCEF shall determine if it can obtain the required
access network information for the used IP CAN type. If the PCEF determines
that the IP CAN type does not support such procedures, the PCEF shall
immediately inform the PCRF by including the NetLoc-Access-Support AVP with
the value of 0 (NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED) in the RAA command. Otherwise,
the PCEF shall apply appropriate IP CAN specific procedures to obtain this
information. When the PCEF then receives access network information through
those IP CAN specific procedures , the PCEF shall provide the required access
network information to the PCRF as follows:
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was provided
to the PCEF, the PCEF shall provide the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP and the time when it was last known within User-
Location-Info-Time AVP (if available).
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was not
provided to the PCEF, the PCEF shall provide the serving PLMN identifier
within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP.
\- If the time zone was requested by the PCRF, the PCEF shall provide it
within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
In addition, the PCEF shall provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event
trigger within Event-Trigger AVP. The kind of user location retrieved in the
access network is defined in the corresponding annex.
During bearer deactivation procedure, the PCEF shall provide the access
network information to the PCRF by including the user location information
within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if user location information was
requested by the PCRF and was provided to the PCEF), the information on when
the UE was last known to be in that location within User-Location-Info-Time
AVP (if user location information was requested by the PCRF and the
corresponding information was provided to the PCEF), the PLMN identifier
within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if the user location information was
requested by the PCRF but was not provided to the PCEF) and the timezone
information within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if requested by the PCRF).
During IP-CAN session termination procedure, the PCEF shall, if
ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, provide the access network
information to the PCRF by including the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if it was provided to the PCEF), the information
on when the UE was last known to be in that location within User-Location-
Info-Time AVP (if it was provided to the PCEF), the PLMN identifier within the
3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if the user location information was not provided to
the PCEF) and the timezone information within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
The PCEF shall not report any subsequent access network information updates
received from the IP-CAN without any previous provisioning or removal of
related PCC rules unless the associated IP-CAN bearer or connection has been
released.
### 4.5.23 Application Detection Information
The PCRF may instruct the PCEF to detect application (s) by providing the
Charging-Rule-Install AVP (s) with the corresponding parameters as follows:
the application to be detected is identified by the TDF-Application-Identifier
AVP, which is either provided under Charging-Rule-Definition AVP for dynamic
PCC Rules or pre-provisioned for the corresponding predefined PCC Rule, and in
such a case only Charging-Rule-Name/Charging-Rule-Base-Name is provided. If
the PCRF requires to be reported about when the application start/stop is
detected, it shall also subscribe to the APPLICATION_START and
APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers. The PCRF may also mute such a notification
about a specific detected application by providing Mute-Notification AVP
within the PCC Rule.
The PCEF applies the PCC rule to the whole IP-CAN session traffic for the
application detection and control. When the start or stop of the
application\'s traffic, identified by TDF-Application-Identifier, is detected,
if PCRF has previously subscribed to the APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP
Event-Triggers, unless a request to mute such a notification (Mute-
Notification AVP) is part of the corresponding PCC Rule, the PCEF shall report
the information regarding the detected application\'s traffic in the
Application-Detection-Information AVP in the CCR command.
The corresponding TDF-Application-Identifier AVP shall be included under
Application-Detection-Information AVP. When the Event trigger indicates
APPLICATION_START, the Flow-Information AVP for the detected application may
be included under Application-Detection-Information AVP, if deducible. The
Flow-Information AVP, if present, shall contain the Flow-Description AVP and
Flow-Direction AVP. The TDF-Application-Instance-Identifier, which is
dynamically assigned by the PCEF in order to allow correlation of
APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers to the specific Flow-
Information AVP, if service data flow descriptions are deducible, shall also
be provided when the Flow-Information AVP is included. Also, the corresponding
Event-Trigger (APPLICATION_START or APPLICATION_STOP) shall be provided to
PCRF. When the TDF-Application-Instance-Identifier is provided along with the
APPLICATION_START, it shall also be provided along with the corresponding
APPLICATION_STOP. The PCRF then may make policy decisions based on the
information received and send the corresponding updated or new PCC rules to
the PCEF, and corresponding QoS rules to the BBERF, if applicable.

# 4a Gxx reference points
## 4a.1 Overview
The Gxx reference point is located between the Policy and Charging Rules
Function (PCRF) and the Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF).
Gxc applies when the BBERF is located in the S-GW and Gxa applies when the
BBERF is located in a trusted non-3GPP access. The Gxx reference point is used
for:
\- Provisioning, update and removal of QoS rules from the PCRF to the BBERF.
\- Transmission of traffic plane events from the BBERF to the PCRF.
The stage 2 level requirements for the Gxx reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [23].
Signalling flows related to Rx, Gx and Gxx interfaces are specified in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
Gxx reference point does not apply for 3GPP-GPRS Access Type.
The definition of case 1, case 2a and case 2b is specified in clause 4.0 in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
## 4a.2 Gxx Reference model
The Gxx reference point is defined between the PCRF and the BBERF. The BBERF
is located in the AN-Gateway. The AN-Gateway is the S-GW when Gxc applies and
it is the trusted non-3GPP access gateway when Gxa applies. The relationships
between the different functional entities involved are depicted in figure
4a.2.1 and figure 4a.2.2.
Figure 4a.2.1: Gxx reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with SPR
NOTE 1: The PCEF may support Application Detection and Control feature.
With the UDC-based architecture, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.335 [38] and applied
in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7], the UDR replaces SPR and the Ud reference point
provides access to the subscription data in the UDR. The Ud interface as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.335 [39] is the interface between the PCRF and the UDR.
The relationships between the different functional elements are depicted in
figure 4a.2.2. When UDC architecture is used, SPR and Sp, whenever mentioned
in this document, is replaced by UDR and Ud.

architecture with UDR
NOTE 2: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 3: The UDC Application Informational Model related to the PCRF is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 4: The PCEF may support Application Detection and Control feature.
NOTE 5: PCEF is located in the Gateway node implementing the IP access to the
PDN. Refer to Annexes of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] for application to specific IP-CAN
types.
NOTE 6: Refer to Annexes A.5 and H.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] for application of
AN-Gateways.
## 4a.3 Quality of Service Control Rules
### 4a.3.1 Quality of Service Control Rule Definition
The purpose of the Quality of Service Control rule (QoS rule) for the BBERF is
to:
\- Detect a packet belonging to a service data flow.
\- The service data flow filters within the QoS rule are used for the
selection of downlink IP CAN bearers.
\- The service data flow filters within the QoS rule are used for the
enforcement that uplink IP flows are transported in the correct IP CAN bearer.
\- Identify the service the service data flow contributes to.
For an IP-CAN session, the QoS rules are derived from the PCC rules. The QoS
rule shall contain the same service data flow template, precedence and QoS
information as the corresponding PCC rule. For case 2a (as defined in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8]), the QoS rules that are derived from a PCC rule shall contain the
applicable tunnelling header information.
NOTE 1: During the course of a BBERF relocation procedure, the QoS rules in
the non-primary BBERF might not be consistent with the PCC rules in the PCEF.
For case 2a (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]) there can be also QoS rules
that do not apply to the IP-CAN session and that are local to the access
system, thus not having any corresponding PCC rule. These QoS rules shall not
have any associated tunnelling header information.
The BBERF shall select a QoS rule for each received packet by evaluating
received packets against in this order:
\- if present, the tunnelling header information
\- the service data flow filters of QoS rules, associated with the matching
tunnelling header information, in their order of the precedence.
\- service data flow filters of QoS rules not associated with any tunnelling
header info.
When a packet matches a service data flow filter, the packet matching process
for that packet is completed, and the QoS rule for that filter shall be
applied.
There are two different types of QoS rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]:
\- Dynamic Qos rules. Dynamically provisioned by the PCRF to the BBERF via the
Gxx interface. These QoS rules are dynamically generated in the PCRF according
to the corresponding PCC rules.
\- Predefined QoS rules. Preconfigured in the BBERF. Predefined QoS rules can
be activated or deactivated by the PCRF along with the corresponding
predefined PCC rules. Predefined QoS rules within the BBERF may be grouped
allowing the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of QoS rules over the Gxx
reference point.
NOTE 2: The mechanism for configuring pre-defined QoS rules at the BBERF and
PCRF and corresponding pre-defined PCC rules at the PCEF and PCRF are outside
the scope of this specification.
A QoS rule consists of:
\- a rule name;
\- service data flow filter(s);
\- precedence;
\- QoS parameters;
The rule name shall be used to reference a QoS rule in the communication
between the BBERF and the PCRF.
The service data flow filter(s) shall be used to select the traffic for which
the rule applies.
The QoS information includes the QoS class identifier (authorized QoS class
for the service data flow), the ARP and authorized bitrates for uplink and
downlink.
For different QoS rules with overlapping service data flow filter, the
precedence of the rule determines which of these rules is applicable. When a
dynamic QoS rule and a predefined QoS rule have the same precedence, the
dynamic QoS rule takes precedence.
### 4a.3.2 Operations on QoS Rules
For dynamic QoS rules, the following operations are available:
\- Installation: to provision a QoS rule that has not been already
provisioned.
\- Modification: to modify a QoS rule already installed.
\- Removal: to remove a QoS rule already installed.
For predefined QoS rules, the following operations are available:
\- Activation: to allow the QoS rule being active.
\- Deactivation: to disallow the QoS rule.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4a.5.2.
## 4a.4 Functional elements
### 4a.4.1 PCRF
The PCRF has been already specified in clause 4.4.1. Particularities for the
Gxx reference point are specified in this clause.
The PCRF shall provision QoS Rules to the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
The PCRF shall provide QoS rules with identical service data flow templates as
provided to the PCEF in the PCC rules. If the service data flow is tunnelled
at the BBERF, the PCRF shall provide the BBERF with mobility protocol
tunnelling header information received from the PCEF to enable the service
data flow detection in the mobility tunnel at the BBERF.
If IP flow mobility applies, the PCRF shall, based on IP flow mobility routing
rules received from the PCEF, provide the authorized QoS rules to the
applicable BBERF.
The PCRF QoS Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- Information obtained from the AF via the Rx reference point, e.g. the
session, media and subscriber related information.
\- Information obtained from the PCEF via the Gx reference point, e.g. IP-CAN
bearer attributes, request type, subscriber related information and IP flow
mobility routing rules (if IP flow mobility is supported).
\- Information obtained from the SPR via the Sp reference point, e.g.
subscriber and service related data.
\- Information obtained from the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
The PCRF shall inform the BBERF through the use of QoS rules on the treatment
of each service data flow that is under PCC control, in accordance with the
PCRF policy decision(s).
Upon subscription to loss of AF signalling bearer notifications by the AF, the
PCRF shall request to BBERF to be notified of the loss of resources associated
to the QoS Rules corresponding with AF Signalling IP Flows, if this has not
been requested previously to the BBERF. In this case, PCRF will not subscribe
to this event in the PCEF.
The PCRF shall, based on information reported from BBERF and PCEF, determine
the Gx session(s) that shall be linked with a Gateway Control session.
### 4a.4.2 BBERF
The BBERF (Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function) is a functional
element located in the S-GW when Gxc applies and in a trusted non-3GPP access
when Gxa applies. It provides control over the user plane traffic handling and
encompasses the following functionalities:
\- Bearer binding: For a service data flow that is under QoS control, the
Bearer Binding Function (BBF) within BBERF shall ensure that the service data
flow is carried over the bearer with the appropriate QoS class. The ARP, GBR,
MBR and QCI are used by the BBERF in the same way as in the PCEF for resource
reservation.
\- Uplink bearer binding verification.
\- Event reporting: The BBERF shall report events to the PCRF based on the
event triggers installed by the PCRF.
\- Service data flow detection for tunnelled and untunnelled SDFs: The BBERF
uses service data flow filters received from the PCRF for service data flow
detection.
\- Service data flow detection for tunnelled SDFs: For the selection of the
service data flow filters to apply the BBERF shall use a match with the
tunnelling associated tunnelling header information received from the PCRF as
a prerequisite.
If requested by the PCRF, the BBERF shall report to the PCRF when the status
of the related service data flow changes.
## 4a.5 PCC procedures over Gxx reference points
### 4a.5.1 Gateway control and QoS Rules Request
The BBERF shall indicate, via the Gxx reference point, a request for QoS rules
in the following instances:
1) At Gateway Control Session Establishment:
The BBERF shall send a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\". The CCR command shall include the IMSI within the
Subscription-Id AVP and the access network gateway address within the AN-GW-
Address AVP. If available and applicable, the BBERF shall supply one or more
of the following additional parameters to allow the PCRF to identify the rules
to be applied : the type of IP-CAN within the IP-CAN-Type AVP, the type of the
radio access technology within the RAT-Type AVP, the PDN information within
the Called-Station-Id AVP, the PDN connection identifier within the PDN-
Connection-ID AVP, if multiple PDN connections for the same APN are supported,
the PLMN id within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP, the UE Ipv4 address within the
Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or the UE Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix
AVP, information about the user equipment within User-Equipment-Info AVP, QoS
information within QoS-Information-AVP, user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP or 3GPP2-BSID AVP, the access network gateway
address, and the UE time zone information within 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
Furthermore, if applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF may indicate the
support of network-initiated bearer request procedures by supplying the
Network-Request-Support AVP. The BBERF shall also send the APN-AMBR if
available using the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL/UL AVPs.
For case 2b, the BBERF may provide the Session-Linking-Indicator AVP to
indicate whether the PCRF shall perform the linking of the new Gateway Control
Session with an existing Gx session immediately or not.
For IP-CAN types that support multiple IP-CAN bearers, the BBERF may provide
the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the ARP and QCI values corresponding
to the Default EPS Bearer QoS.
2) At Gateway Control Session Modification:
The BBERF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\". For a Gateway Control and QoS Rules request where an
existing IP-CAN resource is modified, the BBERF shall supply within the QoS
rule request the specific event which caused such request (within the Event-
Trigger AVP) and any previously provisioned QoS rule(s) affected by the
gateway control and QoS Rules request. The affected QoS Rules and their status
shall be supplied to the PCRF within the QoS-Rule-Report AVP.
In the case that the UE initiates a resource modification procedure, the BBERF
shall include within the CC-Request the Event-Trigger AVP set to
\"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\" and shall include the Packet-Filter-
Operation AVP set as follows:
\- When the UE requests to allocate new resources the BBERF shall set the
Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"ADDITION\", and shall include within the CC-
Request a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter requested by
the UE and the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the
affected packet filters. Each Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include the
packet filter precedence information within the Precedence AVP and the Packet-
Filter-Content AVP set to the value of the packet filter provided by the UE.
If the UE has specified a reference to an existing packet filter, the BBERF
shall include an additional Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the
Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP, set to the value for the referred existing
filter. If the QoS rule is generated for a GBR QCI, the PCRF shall update the
existing QoS rule by adding the new packet filter(s).
\- When the UE requests to modify existing resources the BBERF shall set the
Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include within the
CC-Request a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each affected packet filter. A
packet filter is affected by the modification if QoS associated with it is
modified or if its filter value or precedence is modified. If the UE request
includes modified QoS information the BBERF shall also include the QoS-
Information AVP within the CC-Request to indicate the updated QoS for the
affected packet filters. Each Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include a
packet filter identifier as provided by the PCRF in the QoS rule within the
Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP identifying the previously requested packet
filter being modified and, if the precedence value is changed, shall include
packet filter precedence information within the Precedence AVP. For each
packet filter that the UE has requested to modify the filter value (if any),
the BBERF shall provide the Packet-Filter-Content AVP set to the value of the
updated packet filter provided by the UE.
\- When the UE requests to delete resources the BBERF shall set the Packet-
Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\", and shall include within the CC-Request
a Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter deleted by the UE. Each
Packet-Filter-Information AVP shall include a packet filter identifier as
provided by the PCRF within the QoS rule within the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP identifying the previously requested packet filter being deleted. If the
deletion of the packet filters changes the QoS associated with the resource,
the BBERF shall include the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the QoS associated
with the deleted packet filters to allow the PCRF to modify the QoS
accordingly.
QoS rules can also be requested as a consequence of a failure in the QoS rule
installation or enforcement without requiring an Event-Trigger. See clause
4a.5.4.
If the PCRF is, due to incomplete, erroneous or missing information (e.g.
subscription related information not available or authorized QoS exceeding the
subscribed bandwidth) not able to provision a policy decision as response to
the request for QoS Rules by the BBERF, the PCRF may reject the request using
a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140). If the BBERF receives a CC Answer
with this code, the BBERF shall reject the access network specific request
that has resulted in this gateway control and QoS Rules request.
If the PCRF detects that the packet filters in the request for new QoS rules
by the BBERF is covered by the packet filters of outstanding PCC/QoS rules
that the PCRF is provisioning to the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF may reject the
request using a CC-Answer with the Gx experimental result code
DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFLICTING_REQUEST (5147). If the BBERF receives a CC-Answer
with this code, the BBERF shall reject the modification that initiated the CC-
Request.
### 4a.5.2 Gateway control and QoS Rules Provision
#### 4a.5.2.1 Overview
The PCRF may decide to operate on QoS Rules without obtaining a request from
the BBERF, e.g. in response to information provided to the PCRF via the Rx
reference point, or in response to an internal trigger within the PCRF, or
from a trigger by the SPR. To operate on QoS Rules without a request from the
BBERF, the PCRF shall include these QoS Rules in an RA-Request message within
either the QoS-Rule-Install AVP or the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP.
The BBERF shall reply with an RA-Answer. If the corresponding IP-CAN resource
cannot be established or modified to satisfy the bearer binding, then the
BBERF shall reject the activation of a QoS rule using the Gxx experimental
result code DIAMETER_BEARER_EVENT (4142) and a proper Event-Trigger value.
Depending on the cause, the PCRF can decide if re-installation, modification,
removal of QoS Rules or any other action apply.
The PCRF shall indicate, via the Gxx reference point, QoS rules to be applied
at the BBERF. This may be using one of the following procedures:
\- PULL procedure (Provisioning solicited by the BBERF): In response to a
request for QoS rules being made by the BBERF, as described in the preceding
clause, the PCRF shall provision QoS rules in the CC-Answer; or
\- PUSH procedure (Unsolicited provisioning): The PCRF may decide to provision
QoS rules without obtaining a request from the BBERF, e.g. in response to
information provided to the PCRF via the Rx reference point, or in response to
an internal trigger within the PCRF, or from a trigger by the SPR. To
provision QoS rules without a request from the BBERF, the PCRF shall include
these QoS rules in an RA-Request message. The PCRF should NOT send a new RA-
Request command to the PCEF until the previous RA-Request has been
acknowledged for the same IP-CAN session.
For each request from the BBERF or upon the unsolicited provision the PCRF
shall provision zero or more QoS rules. The PCRF may perform an operation on a
single QoS rule by one of the following means:
\- To activate or deactivate a QoS rule that is predefined at the BBERF, the
PCRF shall provision a reference to this QoS rule within a QoS-Rule-Name AVP
and indicate the required action by choosing either the QoS-Rule-Install AVP
or the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- To install or modify a PCRF-provisioned QoS rule, the PCRF shall provision
a corresponding QoS-Rule-Definition AVP within a QoS-Rule-Install AVP.
\- To remove a QoS rule which has previously been provisioned by the PCRF, the
PCRF shall provision the name of this rule as value of a QoS-Rule-Name AVP
within a QoS-Rule-Remove AVP.
As an alternative to providing a single QoS rule, the PCRF may provide a QoS-
Rule-Base-Name AVP within a QoS-Rule-Install AVP or the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP as
a reference to a group of QoS rules predefined at the BBERF. With a QoS-Rule-
Install AVP, a predefined group of QoS rules is activated or moved. With a
QoS-Rule-Remove AVP, a predefined group of QoS rules is deactivated.
The PCRF may combine multiple of the above QoS rule operations in a single CC-
Answer command or RA-Request command.
To install a new or modify an already installed PCRF defined QoS rule, the
QoS-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If a QoS rule with the same rule name,
as supplied in the QoS-Rule-Name AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP,
already exists at the BBERF, the new QoS rule shall update the currently
installed rule. If the existing QoS rule already has attributes also included
in the new QoS rule definition, the existing attributes shall be overwritten.
Any attribute in the existing QoS rule not included in the new QoS rule
definition shall remain valid.
If no QoS rule(s) with uplink packet filters that are provided to the UE that
are bound to a bearer which requires traffic mapping information (according to
the rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]), the BBERF shall derive traffic
mapping information based on implementation specific logic (e.g. traffic
mapping information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in
uplink direction as described in clause 15.3.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [17]) and
shall provide it to the UE.
NOTE 1: For GPRS and EPS, the state of TFT packet filters, as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.060 [17], for an IP-CAN session requires that there is at most one
bearer with no traffic mapping information for the uplink direction.
NOTE 2: For a default bearer, the BBERF will not add traffic mapping
information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink
direction on its own.
Upon the same modification of the QCI and/or ARP of all the QoS rules bound to
the same bearer, the BBERF should modify the QCI and/or ARP for that bearer.
Provisioning of predefined QoS rules upon invocation/revocation of an MPS
service shall be done according to clause 5.3 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
In case 2a, if the PCRF has received the access network charging identifier
information within Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Gx AVP from the PCEF,
the PCRF shall include the Access‑Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP within
the QoS-Rule-Install AVP to inform the BBERF about the charging identifier
information for the related QoS rules. The charging identifier information is
used by the BBERF for charging correlation.
The PCRF may request the BBERF to confirm that the resources associated to a
QoS rule are successfully allocated. To do so the PCRF shall provide the
Event-Trigger AVP with the value SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (22). In
addition the PCRF shall install the rules that need resource allocation
confirmation by including the Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP with the
value ENABLE_NOTIFICATION (0) within the corresponding Charging-Rule-Install
AVP. If a Charging-Rule-Install AVP does not include the Resource-Allocation-
Notification AVP, the resource allocation shall not be notified by the BBERF
even if this AVP was present in previous installations of the same rule.
NOTE 3: The BBERF reporting the successful installation of QoS rules using RAA
command means that the QoS rules are installed but the bearer binding or QoS
resource reservation may not yet be completed, see 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]. The
BBERF informs the PCRF about the successful resource reservation only if the
PCRF has provided the Event-Trigger AVP indicating
SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION (22).
If the provisioning of QoS rules fails or provisioning of QoS rules succeed
and then QoS resource reservation failed, the BBERF informs the PCRF as
described in clause 4a.5.4 QoS Rule Error Handling. Depending on the cause,
PCRF can decide if re-installation, modification, removal of QoS rules or any
other action apply.
If the PCRF is unable to create a QoS rule for the response to the CC Request
by the PCEF, the PCRF may reject the request as described in clause 4a5.1.
### 4a.5.3 Gateway Control Session Termination
The BBERF shall contact the PCRF when the gateway control session is being
terminated (e.g. detach). The BBERF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-
Type AVP set to the value \"TERMINATION_REQUEST\".
If the BBERF needs to send a Gateway Control Session termination request
towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the Gateway Control
Session establishment, the BBERF should not send CC-Request to inform the
PCRF.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the BBERF.
### 4a.5.4 Request of Gateway Control Session Termination
The PCRF may request the termination of a gateway control session.
If the PCRF decides to terminate a gateway control session due to an internal
trigger or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall send an RAR command including
the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the BBERF. When the BBERF receives the RAR
Command, it shall acknowledge the command by sending an RAA command to the
PCRF and instantly remove/deactivate all the QoS rules that have been
previously installed or activated on that gateway control session. And then
the BBERF shall apply the gateway control session termination procedure in
Clause 4a.5.3.
### 4a.5.5 QoS Control Rule error handling
The same error handling behaviour as defined in clause 4.5.12 shall apply for
QoS control rules. However, QoS-Rule-Report AVP shall be used to report the
affected QoS rules instead of Charging-Rule-Report AVP.
### 4a.5.6 Gateway Control session to Gx session linking
For the cases where Gxx is deployed in the network, the PCRF shall determine
at IP-CAN session establishment, which open Gateway Control session applies to
the new established IP-CAN session.
If the already established Gateway Control session for that subscriber is not
related with a PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP was not received
at Gateway Control Session Establishment), the PCRF shall determine that the
IP-CAN session being established corresponds to that Gateway Control Session
if the following conditions are fulfilled:
\- The CoA-IP-Address AVP received in the IP-CAN session establishment matches
the Framed-IP-Address or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix received during the Gateway
Control Session Establishment and
\- Optionally, the Subscription-Id AVP received in the IP-CAN session
establishment matches the Subscription-Id AVP received during the Gateway
Control Session Establishment.
In this case, the PCRF may have more than one IP-CAN Gx session linked to the
Gateway Control session.
If the already established Gateway Control session for that subscriber is
related with a PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP was received
during the Gateway Control Session Establishment), the PCRF shall determine
that the IP-CAN session being established corresponds to that Gateway Control
Session if the following conditions are fulfilled:
\- The Called-Station-Id AVP received in the IP-CAN session establishment
matches the Called-Station-Id AVP received during the Gateway Control Session
Establishment and
\- The Subscription-Id AVP received in the IP-CAN session establishment
matches the Subscription-Id AVP received during the Gateway Control Session
Establishment and
\- If received, the PDN-Connection-ID AVP received in the IP-CAN session
establishment matches the PDN-Connection-ID AVP received during the Gateway
Control Session Establishment.
In this case, the PCRF shall have only one IP-CAN Gx session linked to the
Gateway Control session.
Upon reception of a Gateway Control Session Establishment where there are
already active Gx sessions for that UE in the PCRF (i.e. BBERF relocation,
BBERF pre-registration and flow mobility), the PCRF may be able to determine
the Gx session(s) that apply to the new established Gateway Control session as
follows:
\- If the new Gateway Control session for that subscriber is not related with
a PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP was not received at Gateway
Control Session Establishment), the PCRF shall determine the Gx session(s)
that correspond to that Gateway Control Session upon reception of IP-CAN
session modification. In this case, the same conditions as for the IP-CAN
session establishment must be fulfilled.
\- If the new Gateway Control session for that subscriber is related with a
PDN identifier (i.e. the Called-Station-Id AVP is received) the PCRF shall
check the Session-Linking-Indicator AVP. If it is not received, or it
indicates SESSION_LINKING_IMMEDIATE the PCRF shall determine the Gx session
that corresponds to the Gateway Control Session as follows:
If multiple PDN connections for the same APN are not supported:
\- The Called-Station-Id AVP is received in the Gateway Control Session
Establishment and it matches the APN of the Gx session and
\- The Subscription-Id AVP received in the Gateway Control Session
Establishment matches the Subscription-Id for the IP-CAN session(s) and
\- If received, the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP
included in the Gateway Control Session Establishment matches the Framed-IP-
Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, of the Gx session. If both Framed-
IP-Address AVP and Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are present in the Gateway Control
Session Establishment, both of them must also be present in the Gx session.
NOTE: The Subscription-Id AVP used for the session linking may be in the form
IMSI or IMSI based NAI as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [25].
If multiple PDN connections for the same APN are supported:
\- If the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are received
during the Gateway Control Session Establishment, the PCRF links the Gateway
Control Session to the existing Gx session where Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or
Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are equal and the PDN ID are matched.
\- If the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP are not received
during the Gateway Control Session Establishment, the PCRF has to defer the
linking with existing Gx session until an IP-CAN Session modification is
received with matching UE Identity, PDN Connection ID, and PDN ID.
In this case, the PCRF shall link the Gateway Control Session to the Gx
session.
When the Session-Linking-Indicator AVP is received and indicates
SESSION_LINKING_DEFERRED, the PCRF shall keep the new Gateway Control Session
pending and shall defer linking until an IP-CAN Session Establishment or
Modification is received including the Subscription-Id AVP, Called-Station-Id
AVP and IP-CAN-Type AVP with the same values as those received during the
Gateway Control Session establishment.
### 4a.5.7 Multiple BBF support
#### 4a.5.7.1 General
After the PCRF has linked the new established Gateway Control session with the
active Gx session as specified in clause 4a.5.6, if the PCRF receives the
indication of IP flow mobility applying (e.g. ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE (37) event
trigger) from the active Gx session, then the clause 4a.5.7.3 will apply,
otherwise the clause 4a.5.7.2 will apply.
#### 4a.5.7.2 Handling of two BBFs associated with the same IP-CAN session
during handover
This procedure takes place during the handover situations where one or more
BBF can be part of a pre-registration procedure. The two BBFs can be located
in two separate BBERFs, or one BBF is located in the PCEF and the other one in
a BBERF.
The PCRF, based on IP-CAN type information received from the BBERF and PCEF,
shall identify the BBERF as primary or non-primary.
Upon receiving a Gateway Control Session Establishment request from a new
BBERF and if the PCRF identifies multiple Gateway Control sessions involved
for a particular IP-CAN session (i.e. multiple BBERF connections during
handovers) the PCRF shall carry out the following procedures:
\- The PCRF shall identify the Gateway Control session that reported the same
IP-CAN type as reported by PCEF and classify the BBERF that initiated that
Gateway Control session as \"primary\".
\- In the case where more that one Gateway Control sessions reported the same
IP-CAN type as reported by PCEF the PCRF shall classify the BBERF that
initiated the last Gateway Control session as \"primary\".
\- The remaining BBERF connections shall be classified by the PCRF as \"non-
primary\".
Additionally, the PCRF may update the PCC rules, derive corresponding QoS
rules and provide the updated QoS rules to the new BBERF to accommodate the
capabilities of the target access network (e.g. based on RAT and IP-CAN
types).
During the Gateway Control and QoS Rule Request, the PCRF shall act as follows
with regards to the Gxx reference point:
\- In the response to a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\", if the BCM selected by the PCRF for that BBERF
(primary/non-primary) indicates UE_NW, the PCRF shall provision the applicable
active QoS rules for the linked IP-CAN session in the QoS-Rule-Install AVP in
the CC-Answer command. In the case of non-primary BBERF, only those that do
not require any modification for the active PCC rules will be provided.
\- In the response of a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", if the BCM selected by the PCRF for that BBERF
(primary/non-primary) that initiated the Gateway Control session indicates
UE_ONLY, the PCRF shall only include QoS rules applicable to the default
bearer in the CC-Answer command.
\- In the response to a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" initiated by a BBERF that the PCRF has classified as non-
primary, indicating UE-initiated resource modification request as described in
clause 4a.5.1, the PCRF shall create the QoS rules based on the traffic
mapping information received in the request and check whether there are
aligned PCC rules installed in the PCEF. If the aligned PCC rules active in
the PCEF require no modification, the PCRF shall provision the QoS rules
within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP to the non-primary BBERF that created the
request. Otherwise, the PCRF shall reject the request using the Gxx
experimental result code DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144).
\- In the response to a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" initiated by a BBERF including any other event trigger
within the Event-Trigger AVP, the PCRF shall provision/modify/remove the
applicable QoS rules in the CC-Answer command when the BBERF is selected as
primary. Otherwise, only QoS rules with aligned active PCC rules will be
provided.
NOTE: The PCRF operates on the PCC rules towards the PCEF when the CCR command
was received from a primary BBERF.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" initiated by a BBERF, the PCRF shall apply the
procedure described in clause 4a.5.3.
For unsolicited provisioning of QoS rules, the PCRF shall provision the
applicable QoS rules (those that are Nw-init) to those BBERFs where the Bearer
Control Mode is UE_NW.
For the case where the primary BBERF rejects the installation of one or more
QoS rule(s) in a RA-Answer command, the PCRF shall remove the impacted QoS
rules from all the non-primary BBERFs in a RAR message including the removed
QoS rules in the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP. If a non-primary BBERF rejects the
installation of one or more QoS rules the PCRF shall not take any action
towards the PCEF and BBERFs regarding the rejected rules.
If a primary BBERF reported the failure in a new CC-Request command, the PCRF
shall remove the impacted QoS rules in the CC-Answer command and shall
initiate a RA-Request command towards all the non-primary BBERFs including the
removed QoS rules in the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP. If the BBERF that reported the
failure is a non-primary BBERF, the PCRF shall acknowledge the Diameter CCR
with a CCA command and shall not take further action towards the PCEF and
BBERFs regarding the failed rules.
Upon reception of a CCR command over the Gx interface indicating
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" with Event-Trigger AVP value indicating IP-CAN_CHANGE and
AN_GW_CHANGE, the PCRF shall reclassify the BBERFs based on the classification
procedures described above. After re-classification of the BBERFs, the PCRF
shall perform necessary update to the QoS rules in the new primary BBERF based
on the status of the PCC rules and the Bearer Control Mode supported.
When the PCEF subscribes to events by using the Event-Report-Indication AVP,
the PCRF shall provision those events only in the primary BBERF.
#### 4a.5.7.3 Handling of multiple BBFs with flow mobility within IP-CAN
session
This procedure takes place during flow mobility situations where more than one
BBF exist within the same IP-CAN session. The multiple BBFs can be located in
separate BBERFs, or one BBF is located in the PCEF and the other one in
separate BBERFs.
For flow mobility within IP-CAN session, the PCRF does not differentiate
between primary and non-primary BBFs. Based on the IP flow mobility routing
rule information received from the PCEF, the PCRF may associate the default
route with one of the BBFs. The default route is identified by the IP flow
mobility routing rule containing a wild card routing filter.
Upon an IP-CAN Session Establishment or IP-CAN Session Modification that
includes one or more Routing‑Rule- Definition AVP(s), the PCRF shall store the
IP flow mobility routing rule information.
Upon an IP-CAN Session Modification that includes one or more Routing-Rule-
Definition AVP(s), the PCRF shall check whether there are service data flow(s)
for active PCC Rules that can be associated with one BBF based on the routing
information by comparing the Flow-Information AVP of the PCC Rules with the
Routing-Filter AVP of the Routing‑Rule‑Definition AVP. If they match, the PCRF
determines that the bearer binding for a service data flow is located in a BBF
comparing the Routing-IP-address AVP contained in the IP flow mobility routing
rule against the Framed-IP-Address/Framed-Ipv6-Prefix and CoA-IP-Address
received during the IP-CAN session establishment/modification. The matching IP
address will identify the BBF to be used for the related service data flows.
When the BBF corresponds to a BBERF, the PCRF shall, if required, create the
QoS rules, and provide the QoS rules to the identified BBERF.
If the PCRF creates new PCC Rules or modifies the Flow-Information AVP of an
existing one (e.g. as a consequence of an AF interaction, or Bearer Resource
Modification Request), the PCRF shall check if the new service data flow
information matches any of the IP flow mobility routing rule information. If
they match, the PCRF determines that the bearer binding for a service data
flow is located in a BBF comparing the Routing-IP-address AVP contained in the
IP flow mobility routing rule against the Framed-IP-Address/Framed-Ipv6-Prefix
and CoA-IP-Address received during the IP-CAN session
establishment/modification. The matching IP address will identify the BBF to
be used for the related service data flows. If the PCRF determines that the
bearer binding for a service data flow is located in the BBERF, the PCRF
shall, if required, create the QoS rules, and provide the QoS rules to the
identified BBERF.
NOTE: For IP flow mobility, the address/prefix contained in the CoA-IP-Address
AVP identifies the BBERF set up for case 2a; the address/prefix contained in
the Framed-IP-Address or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP identifies the BBF located in
the PCEF or in the BBERF of the 3GPP access.
The PCRF may select different bearer control mode for different BBFs based on
the procedures described in clause 4.5.10 for PCEF and clause 4a.5.9 for
BBERF. Provision of PCC/QoS rules to a specific BBF follows the rule provision
procedures based on the bearer control mode selected for that BBF.
When the route of a service data flow changes from one source BBF to another
target BBF, the PCRF shall:
\- if the source BBF is located in a BBERF, remove the QoS rules related to
the service data flow from the source BBERF following the Gateway control and
QoS rules provision procedures described in clause 4a.5.2;
\- if the target BBF is located in a BBERF, and the BCM is NW_UE, provision
the QoS rules related to the service data flow to the target BBERF following
the Gateway control and QoS rules provision procedures described in clause
4a.5.2
The PCRF supporting IFOM that has received an IP-CAN type associated to an
established IP-CAN session, upon reception of an IP-CAN type AVP from a PCEF
as part of an IP-CAN session modification procedure, if the IP-CAN type is
different from the one stored for that IP-CAN session and the IP-CAN session
modification contains the ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE event trigger, shall associate
the new received IP CAN type to the IP-CAN session (i.e. multiple IP-CAN types
are associated to the IP-CAN session).
### 4a.5.8 Provisioning of Event Triggers
The PCRF may provide one or several event triggers within one or several
Event-Trigger AVP to the BBERF using the Gateway Control and QoS rule
provision procedure. Event triggers may be used to determine which specific
event causes the BBERF to re-request QoS rules. Provisioning of event triggers
will be done at Gateway Control session level. The Event-Trigger AVP may be
provided either in combination with the initial or subsequent QoS rule
provisioning.
The PCEF may request the PCRF to be informed about specific changes occurred
in the access network as indicated in clause 4.5.11. In this case, the PCRF
shall additionally subscribe to the corresponding event triggers at the BBERF.
The PCRF may add new event triggers or remove the already provided ones at
each request from the BBERF or upon the unsolicited provision from the PCRF.
In order to do so, the PCRF shall provide the new complete list of applicable
event triggers related to the Gateway Control session including the needed
provisioned Event-Trigger AVPs in the CCA or RAR commands.
The BBERF shall include the initial information related to the event trigger
that has been provisioned in the Event-Trigger AVP in the response to the
Gateway Control and QoS rule provisioning procedure. The initial information
related to the event trigger is included within a RAA command.
The PCRF may remove all previously provided event triggers by providing the
Event-Trigger AVP set to the value NO_EVENT_TRIGGERS. When an Event-Trigger
AVP is provided with this value, no other Event-Trigger AVP shall be provided
in the CCA or RAR command. Upon reception of an Event-Trigger AVP with this
value, the BBERF shall not inform PCRF of any event that requires to be
provisioned from the PCRF except for those events that are always reported and
do not require provisioning from the PCRF.
If no Event-Trigger AVP is included in a CCA or RAR operation, any previously
provisioned event trigger will be still applicable.
### 4a.5.9 Bearer Control Mode Selection
When bearer binding is performed at the BBERF, the BBERF may indicate, via the
Gxx reference point, a request for Bearer Control Mode (BCM) selection at
Gateway Control session establishment. It will be done using the Gateway
Control and QoS rule request procedure.
When applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF shall supply at Gateway Control
Session Establishment, if information about the support of network initiated
procedures is available, the Network-Request-Support AVP in the CC-Request
with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\". The Network-
Request-Support AVP indicates the access network support of the network
requested bearer control.
The PCRF derives the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy. If the selected bearer control mode is UE_NW,
the PCRF shall decide what mode (UE or NW) shall apply for every QoS rule.
NOTE: For operator-controlled services, the UE and the PCRF may be provisioned
with information indicating which mode is to be used.
The selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP shall be provided to the BBERF using the
Gateway Control and QoS Rules provision procedure at Gateway Control session
establishment. The selected value will be applicable for the whole Gateway
Control session.
When the bearer binding function is changed from the PCEF to the BBERF, the
BBERF may indicate, via the Gxx reference point, a request for Bearer Control
Mode (BCM) selection at Gateway Control Session Establishment as described
above.
In multiple BBERFs case, each BBERF may indicate a request for Bearer Control
Mode selection independently and the BCM selected for each BBERF may be
different.
### 4a.5.10 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
#### 4a.5.10.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS for the Default EPS Bearer
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS for the default EPS bearer. The
authorized QoS may be obtained upon interaction with the SPR.
The default EPS bearer QoS information shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA
command level using the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP including the QoS-Class-
Identifier AVP and the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP. The provided QoS-
Class-Identifier AVP shall include a non-GBR corresponding value.
#### 4a.5.10.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS of the Default EPS Bearer
The BBERF may receive the authorized QoS for the default bearer over Gxx
interface. The BBERF enforces it which may lead to the change of the
subscribed default EPS Bearer QoS.
#### 4a.5.10.3 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
The PCRF may provision the authorized QoS per APN as part of the Gateway
Control and QoS rules provision procedure.
The authorized QoS per APN may be modified at Gateway Control session
establishment and also at Gateway Control session modification. To do so, the
PCRF shall provision the authorized QoS per APN for each IP-CAN session for
that APN.
The authorized QoS per APN shall be provisioned at RAR or CCA command level
using the QoS-Information AVP including the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL AVP
and/or the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP. When APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL
AVP and/or the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL AVP are provided, the Max-
Requested-Bandwidth values, and the Guaranteed Bitrate values shall not be
included.
NOTE: The QoS per APN limits the aggregate bit rate of all Non‑GBR bearers of
the same APN, i.e. the GBR bearers are outside the scope of QoS per APN.
Upon receiving the subscribed AMBR per APN from the BBERF, the PCRF shall be
able to provision the AMBR per APN to the PCEF for enforcement using the
provisioning of authorized QoS per APN procedure specified in clause 4.5.5.7.
#### 4a.5.10.4 Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per service data flow is a part of QoS rule
provisioning procedure, as described in Clause 4a.5.2.
The authorized QoS per service data flow shall be provisioned within the
corresponding QoS rule by including the QoS-Information AVP within the QoS-
Rule-Definition AVP in the CCA or RAR commands. This QoS-Information AVP shall
not contain a Bearer-Identifier AVP.
#### 4a.5.10.5 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per service data flow
The BBERF shall reserve the resources necessary for the guaranteed bitrate for
the QoS rule upon receipt of a QoS rule provisioning including QoS
information. The BBERF shall start the needed procedures to ensure that the
provisioned resources are according to the authorized values. This may imply
that the BBERF needs to request the establishment of new IP CAN bearer(s) or
the modification of existing IP CAN bearer(s). If the enforcement is not
successful, the BBERF shall inform the PCRF as described in clause 4a.5.5.
Upon deactivation or removal of a QoS rule, the BBERF shall free the resources
reserved for that QoS rule.
### 4a.5.11 Trace activation/deactivation
Trace activation/deactivation at the P-GW takes place via the PCRF and is
3GPP-EPS access specific. See Annex B for further information.
### 4a.5.12 IMS Emergency Session Support
#### 4a.5.12.1 PCC procedures for Emergency services over Gxx reference point
##### 4a.5.12.1.1 Gateway control and QoS Rules request for Emergency services
The BBERF executes the same procedure as for a Gateway control and QoS Rules
request unrelated to Emergency Services described in clause 4a.5.1.
A BBERF that requests QoS Rules at Gateway Control Session Establishment shall
send a CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\".
For case 2b the BBERF shall send the Called-Station-Id AVP including the
Emergency APN. The BBERF may include the IMSI within the Subscription-Id AVP
and if the IMSI is not available the BBERF shall include the IMEI within the
User-Equipment-Info AVP. The BBERF may include the rest of the attributes
described in clause 4a.5.1.
If the PCRF detects that the initial or subsequent CCR command shall be
rejected, it shall execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental
result code described in clause 4a.5.1.
##### 4a.5.12.1.2 Provisioning of QoS Rules for Emergency services
###### 4a.5.12.1.2.1 Provisioning of QoS Rules at Gxx session establishment
The PCRF shall detect that a Gxx session is restricted to IMS Emergency
services when a CCR command is received with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the Called-Station-Id AVP includes a PDN
identifier that matches one of the Emergency APNs from the configurable list.
The PCRF:
\- shall provision QoS Rules restricting the access to Emergency Services
(e.g. P-CSCF(s), DHCP(s) and DNS (s) and SUPL(s) addresses) as required by
local operator policies in a CCA command according to the procedures described
in clause 4a.5.2.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to the default EPS bearer
within the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP in a CCA command according to the
procedures described in clause 4a.5.10.1 except for obtaining the authorized
QoS upon interaction with the SPR. The value for the Priority-Level AVP shall
be assigned as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an IMS Emergency
session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a value that is
reserved for an operator domain use of IMSEmergency sessions). If the IP-CAN
Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" the values for Pre-emption-Capability AVP
and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall be assigned as required by local
operator policies.
\- may provision the authorized QoS that applies to an APN within the APN-
Aggregate-Max-Bitrate UL/DL in a CCA command according to the procedures
described in clause 4a.5.10.3.
When the PCEF detects that the provisioning of QoS Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4a.5.5.
###### 4a.5.12.1.2.2 Provisioning of QoS Rules for Emergency services
When the PCRF receives IMS service information from the AF for an Emergency
service and derives authorized QoS Rules from the service information, the
priority in the Priority-Level AVP in the QoS information within the QoS Rule
shall be assigned a value as required by local operator policies (e.g. if an
IMS Emergency session is prioritized the Priority-Level AVP may contain a
value that is reserved for an operator domain use of IMSEmergency sessions).
If the IP-CAN Type AVP is assigned to \"3GPP-EPS\" the values for the Pre-
emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall also be
assigned as required by local operator policies.
The PCRF shall derive authorized QoS Rules from the PCC Rules that are bound
to an IP-CAN session restricted to Emergency services and immediately initiate
a PUSH procedure as described in clause 4a.5.2.1 to provision QoS Rules and
the procedures described in clause 4.5.5.2 to provision the authorized QoS per
service data flow.
Any BBERF-initiated request for QoS Rules for an IMS Emergency service
triggered by Event-Trigger AVP assigned to \"RESOURCE_MODIFICATION_REQUEST\"
(i.e. UE-initiated resource reservation) shall be rejected by the PCRF, with
the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
The BBERF shall execute the procedures described in clause 4a.5.2.1 and clause
4.5.5.3 to ensure that a new IP-CAN bearer is established for the Emergency
service.
When the BBERF detects that the provisioning of QoS Rules failed, it shall
execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental result code described in
clause 4a.5.5.
#### 4a.5.12.2 Gateway Control Session to Gx session linking
If the Subscription-Id AVP was not received, the PCRF shall perform Gateway
Control Session to Gx session linking by using the User-Equipment-Info AVP.
#### 4a.5.12.3 Removal of QoS Rules for Emergency Services
The reception of a request to terminate an AF session for an IMS Emergency
service by the PCRF triggers the removal of QoS Rules assigned to the
terminated IMS Emergency Service from the BBERF by using the clause 4a.5.2.1
to provision QoS Rules.
At reception of a RAR that removes one or several QoS Rules from an IP-CAN
Session restricted to emergency services the BBERF shall:
\- when all QoS Rules bound to an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer termination procedure.
\- when not all QoS Rules bound an IP-CAN bearer are removed, initiate an IP-
CAN bearer modification procedure.
#### 4a.5.12.4 Termination of Gateway Control session for Emergency Services
The procedure to terminate a Gateway Control Session defined for case 2b) in
4a.5.3 and for case 2a) in 4a.5.4 applies.
### 4a.5.13 Time of the day procedures
BBERF shall be able to perform PCC rule request as instructed by the PCRF. To
do so, the PCRF shall provide the Event-Trigger AVP with the value
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT (17) if the event trigger is not previously set, and in
addition the Revalidation-Time AVP when set by the PCRF. This shall cause the
BBERF to trigger a PCRF interaction to request QoS rules from the PCRF for an
established gateway control session. The BBERF shall stop the timer once the
BBERF triggers a REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event. The BBERF should send the PCC
rule request during a preconfigured period before the indicated revalidation
time.
NOTE 1: The PCRF is expected to be prepared to provide a new policy, as
desired for the revalidation time, during a preconfigured period before the
revalidation time.The preconfigured periods in the BBERF and PCRF need to be
aligned.
PCRF shall be able to provide a new value for the revalidation timeout by
including Revalidation-Time AVP in CCA or RAR. The PCRF may provide the
Revalidation-Time AVP together with the event trigger REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT or
in a subsequent QoS rule provisioning.
PCRF shall be able to stop the revalidation timer by disabling the
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event trigger.
NOTE 2: By disabling the REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT the revalidation time value
previously provided to the BBERF is not applicable anymore.
If the PCRF includes the activation time in Rule-Activation-Time and/or the
deactivation time in Rule-Deactivation-Time when the PCRF provision the PCC
rules to the PCEF, the PCRF shall set the same activation time in Rule-
Activation-Time and/or the deactivation time in Rule-Deactivation-Time when
the PCRF provision the corresponding QoS rules to the BBERF.
The PCRF may control at what time the status of a QoS rule changes.
1) If Rule-Activation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the BBERF shall set the QoS rule inactive and make it active at that time. If
Rule-Activation-Time has passed, then the BBERF shall immediately set the QoS
rule active.
2) If Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the BBERF shall set the QoS rule active and make it inactive at that time. If
Rule-Deactivation-Time has passed, then the BBERF shall immediately set the
QoS rule inactive.
3) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, and also
when the QoS rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, the BBERF shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then
as defined in 2).
4) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, and also
when the QoS rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Activation-Time, the BBERF shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as
defined in 1).
5) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has already occurred for both, and the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before
the Rule-Deactivation-Time, then the BBERF shall immediately set the QoS rule
inactive.
6) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the
Rule-Activation-Time, then the BBERF shall immediately set the QoS rule
active.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified in the QoS-
Rule-Install then it will replace the previously set values for the specified
QoS rules. If Rule-Activation-Time AVP, Rule-Deactivation-Time AVP or both
AVPs are omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is no longer
valid.
The 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available, may be used by the PCRF to derive the
Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time.
If the QoS rule(s) that include the Rule-Activation-Time AVP are bound to a
bearer that will require traffic mapping information to be sent to the UE, the
BBERF shall report the failure to the PCRF by including the QoS-Rule-Report
AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code set the value \"NO_BEARER_BOUND (15)\" for the
affected QoS rule(s) identified by the QoS-Rule-Name AVP in either a CCR or an
RAA command.
NOTE 3: This limitation prevents dependencies on the signalling of changed
traffic mapping information towards the UE.
The QoS rules including Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time shall
not be applied for changes of the QoS or service data flow filter information.
### 4a.5.14 Multimedia Priority Support
#### 4a.5.14.1 PCC Procedures for Multimedia Priority services over Gxx
reference point
##### 4a.5.14.1.1 Provisioning of QoS Rules for Multimedia Priority Services
The provision of QoS Rules corresponding to both MPS and non-MPS services
shall be performed as described in clause 4a.5.2.
The QoS Rules applicable for MPS and non-MPS services shall be derived from
the PCC Rules generated as described in clause 4.5.191.2.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the PCRF shall check whether any of these parameters are
stored in the SPR: MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling
Priority. The PCRF shall derive the QoS Rules from the generated PCC Rules and
default bearer QoS based on that information. If the IMS Signalling Priority
is set and the Called-Station-Id AVP is received and corresponds to an APN
dedicated for IMS, the PCRF shall assign an ARP corresponding to MPS for the
default bearer and for the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding to the IMS signalling
bearer. If the Called-Station-Id AVP does not correspond to an APN dedicated
for IMS, the ARP shall be derived without considering IMS Signalling Priority.
NOTE 0: Subscription data for MPS is provided to PCRF through the Sp reference
point.
Once the PCRF receives a notification of a change in MPS EPS Priority, MPS
Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling Priority from the SPR, the PCRF shall
make the corresponding policy decisions (i.e. ARP and/or QCI change) and, if
applicable, shall initiate a RAR command to provision the modified data.
NOTE 1: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 2: The MPS Priority Level is one among other input data such as operator
policy for the PCRF to set the ARP.
##### 4a.5.14.1.2 Invocation/Revocation of Priority EPS Bearer Services
When a Priority EPS Bearer Service is invoked or revoked, the PCRF shall
behave as described in clause 4.5.19.1.2. The PCRF shall derive the QoS Rules
from the applicable PCC Rules.
The PCRF shall provision the BBERF with the applicable QoS Rules upon Priority
EPS Bearer Service activation and deactivation as described in clause 4a.5.2.
The provision of the QoS information applicable for the QoS Rules shall be
performed as described in clause 4a.5.10.4. The provision of QoS information
for the default bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4a.5.10.1.
##### 4a.5.14.1.3 Invocation/Revocation of IMS Multimedia Priority Services
If the PCRF receives service information including an MPS session indication
and the service priority level from the P-CSCF or detects that the P-CSCF
released all the MPS Session, the PCRF shall behave as described in clause
4.5.19.1.3. The PCRF shall derive the QoS Rules from the applicable PCC Rules.
The PCRF shall provision the BBERF with the applicable QoS Rules upon MPS
session initiation and release as described in clause 4a.5.2. The provision of
the QoS information applicable for the QoS Rules shall be performed as
described in clause 4a.5.10.4. The provision of QoS information for the
default bearer shall be performed as described in clause 4a.5.10.1.
### 4a.5.15 PCRF Failure and Restoration
If the BBERF needs to send a Gateway Control Session modification request
towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the Gateway Control
Session establishment, the BBERF should not send the Gateway Control Session
modification request towards a PCRF and the BBERF may tear down the associated
PDN connection based on operator policy, by initiating PDN connection
deactivation procedure. Emergency and eMPS sessions should not be torn down.
NOTE 1: This mechanism enables the clean up of PDN connections affected by the
PCRF failure and leads the UE to initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure for the same APN.
NOTE 2: The method the BBERF uses to determine that a PCRF has restarted is
not specified in this release.
### 4a.5.16 Reporting Access Network Information
If the AF requests the PCRF to report the access network information and if
the PCRF cannot determine that access network information cannot be provided
as described in clause 5.5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall provide
the requested access network information indication (e.g. user location and/or
user timezone information) to the BBERF as follows:
\- If the PCRF is installing or modifying a QoS rule, the PCRF shall include
the Required-Access-Info AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP of an
appropriate installed or modified QoS rule;
\- Otherwise, if the PCRF is removing QoS rules based on the AF requests, the
PCRF shall include the Required-Access-Info AVP within the QoS-Rule-Remove AVP
associated with the corresponding QoS rules being removed.
The PCRF shall also provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger
within Event-Trigger AVP (if this event trigger is not yet set).
For the QoS Rule(s) based on preliminary service information as described in
3GPP TS 29.214 [10] the PCRF may assign the QCI and ARP of the default bearer
to avoid signalling to the UE. These QoS Rules shall not include the Packet-
Filter-Usage AVP within the Flow-Information AVP included in the QoS-Rule-
Definition AVP. These QoS rule(s) may be provisioned by the PCRF without
corresponding PCC rule(s).
NOTE: 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] provides further information about appropriate QoS
rules in clause 6.2.1.0.
If the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, upon installation,
modification and removal of any QoS rule(s) with the Required-Access-Info AVP
in a Gxx RAR command, the BBERF shall determine if it can obtain the required
location information for the used IP CAN type. If the BBERF determines that
the IP CAN type does not support such procedures, the BBERF shall immediately
inform the PCRF by including the NetLoc-Access-Support AVP with the value of 0
(NETLOC_ACCESS_NOT_SUPPORTED) in the RAA command. Otherwise, the BBERF shall
apply appropriate IP CAN specific procedures to obtain this information. When
the BBERF then receives access network information through those IP CAN
specific procedures, the BBERF shall provide the corresponding access network
information to the PCRF as follows:
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was provided
to the BBERF, the BBERF shall provide the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP and the time when it was last known within User-
Location-Info-Time AVP (if available).
\- If the user location information was requested by the PCRF and was not
provided to the BBERF, the BBERF shall provide the serving PLMN identifier
within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP.
\- If the time zone was requested by the PCRF, the BBERF shall provide it
within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
In addition, the BBERF shall provide the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event
trigger within Event-Trigger AVP.
During bearer deactivation procedure, the BBERF shall provide the access
network information to the PCRF by including the user location information
within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if user location information was
requested by the PCRF and was provided to the BBERF), the information on when
the UE was last known to be in that location within User-Location-Info-Time
AVP (if user location information was requested by the PCRF and the
corresponding information was provided to the BBERF), the PLMN identifier
within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if the user location information was
requested by the PCRF but was not provided to the BBERF) and the timezone
information within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP (if requested by the PCRF).
During IP-CAN session termination procedure, the BBERF shall, if
ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, provide the access network
information to the PCRF by including the user location information within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP (if it was provided to the BBERF), the information
on when the UE was last known to be in that location within User-Location-
Info-Time AVP (if it was provided to the BBERF), the PLMN identifier within
the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP (if the user location information was not provided
to the BBERF) and the timezone information within the 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP.
The BBERF shall not report any subsequent access network information updates
received from the IP-CAN without any previous provisioning or removal of
related QoS rules unless the associated IP-CAN bearer or connection has been
released.
# 4b Sd reference point
## 4b.1 Overview
The Sd reference point is located between the Policy and Charging Rules
Function (PCRF) and the Traffic Detection Function (TDF). For the solicited
application reporting, the Sd reference point is used for establishment and
termination of TDF session between PCRF and TDF, provisioning of Application
Detection and Control rules from the PCRF for the purpose of traffic detection
and enforcement at the TDF, usage monitoring control of TDF session and of
detected applications and reporting of the start and the stop of a detected
applications\'s traffic and transfer of service data flow descriptions for
detected applications, ifdeducible, from the TDF to the PCRF. For the
unsolicited reporting, the Sd reference point is used for establishment and
termination of TDF session between PCRF and TDF, reporting of the start and
the stop of a detected application\'s traffic and transfer of service data
flow descriptions for detected applications, if deducible, and transfer of
Application instance identifier, if service data flow descriptions are
deducible, from the TDF to the PCRF.
The stage 2 level requirements for the Sd reference point are defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [7].
Signalling flows related to the Sd, Rx, Gxx and Gx interfaces are specified in
3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
## 4b.2 Sd Reference model
The Sd reference point is defined between the PCRF and the TDF. The
relationships between the different functional entities involved are depicted
in figure 4b.2.1 and 4b.2.2.
Figure 4b.2.1: Sd reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with SPR
NOTE: The PCEF may support Application Detection and Control feature.
With the UDC-based architecture, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.335 [38] and applied
in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7], the UDR replaces SPR and the Ud reference point
provides access to the subscription data in the UDR. The Ud interface as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.335 [39] is the interface between the PCRF and the UDR
The relationships between the different functional elements are depicted in
figure 4b.2.2. When UDC architecture is used, SPR and Sp, whenever mentioned
in this document, is replaced by UDR and Ud.
Figure 4b.2.2: Sd reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with UDR
NOTE 1: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 2: The UDC Application Informational Model related to the PCRF is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 3: The PCEF may support Application Detection and Control feature.
## 4b.3 Application Detection and Control Rules
### 4b.3.1 Functional entities
The PCRF may provide ADC Rules to the TDF by using Sd interface.
Once the start or stop of the application\'s traffic, matching one of those
ADC Rules, is detected, if PCRF has previously subscribed to the
APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, unless a request to mute
such a notification (Mute-Notification AVP) is part of the corresponding ADC
Rule, the TDF shall report the information regarding the detected
application\'s traffic to the PCRF and apply the enforcement actions, if
defined within the corresponding ADC Rule.
### 4b.3.2 Application Detection and Control Rule Definition
The purpose of the ADC rule is to apply the detection and enforcement actions
for the specified application traffic.
The TDF shall select an ADC rule for the traffic, matching the application
definition. When the traffic matches an application definition, the matching
process for that traffic is completed, and the ADC rule for that application
shall be applied.
There are two different types of ADC rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]:
\- Dynamic ADC rules. The PCRF can however provide and modify some parameters
via the Sd reference point, respectively. These ADC rules can be installed,
modified and removed at any time. The dynamic ADC rules are applicable only in
case of solicited application reporting.
\- Predefined ADC rules. Preconfigured in the TDF. In the case of solicited
reporting, the Predefined ADC rules can be activated or deactivated by the
PCRF at any time. Predefined ADC rules within the TDF may be grouped allowing
the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of ADC rules.
An ADC rule consists of:
\- a rule identifier;
\- TDF application identifier;
\- monitoring key;
\- gate status;
\- UL maximum bit rate;
\- DL maximum bit rate;
\- redirect.
The rule identifier shall be used to reference an ADC rule in the
communication between the TDF and the PCRF.
NOTE 1: The PCRF has to ensure that there is no dynamically provided ADC rule
that has the same rule identifier value as any of the predefined ADC rules.
The TDF application identifier shall be used to reference the corresponding
application, for which the rule applies during reporting to the PCRF. The same
application identifier value can occur in more than one ADC rule. If so, the
PCRF shall ensure that there is at most one ADC rule active per application
identifier value at any time.
NOTE 2: The same application identifier value could be used for a dynamic ADC
rule and a pre-defined ADC rule or for multiple pre-defined ADC rules.
The monitoring key for an ADC rule identifies a monitoring control instance
that shall be used for usage monitoring control of a particular application or
a group of applications (as identified by the predefined or dynamic ADC
rule(s)) or all detected traffic belonging to a specific TDF session.
The gate status indicates whether the application, identified by the TDF
application identifier, may pass (gate is open) or shall be blocked (gate is
closed) in uplink and/or in downlink direction.
The UL maximum bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the uplink
component of the detected application traffic.
The DL maximum bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the
downlink component of the detected application traffic.
The Redirect indicates whether the uplink part of the detected application
traffic should be redirected to another controlled address. The target
redirect address may also be included.
One or more of the following parameters can be modified for a dynamic ADC
rule:
\- monitoring key;
\- gate status;
\- UL maximum bit rate;
\- DL maximum bit rate;
\- redirect.
### 4b.3.3 Operations on ADC Rules
For dynamic ADC rules, the following operations are available:
\- Installation: to provision an ADC rules that has not been already
provisioned.
\- Modification: to modify an ADC rule already installed.
\- Removal: to remove an ADC rule already installed.
For predefined ADC rules, the following operations are available:
\- Activation: to allow the ADC rule being active.
\- Deactivation: to disallow the ADC rule.
The procedures to perform these operations are further described in clause
4b.5.
## 4b.4 Functional elements
### 4b.4.1 PCRF
The PCRF (Policy Control and Charging Rules Function) is a functional element
that encompasses policy control decision. The PCRF provides network control
regarding the application detection, gating, bandwidth limitation and
redirection towards the TDF.
The PCRF may provision ADC Rules to the TDF via the Sd reference point.
The PCRF ADC Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- Information obtained from the PCEF via the Gx reference point, e.g. request
type, subscriber/device related information, location information.
\- Information obtained from the SPR via the Sp reference point, e.g.
subscriber related data. The subscription information may include user profile
configuration indicating whether application detection and control should be
enabled.
NOTE: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in
this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
\- Information obtained from the TDF via the Sd reference point, e.g. detected
application, usage monitoring report.
\- Information obtained from the BBERF via the Gxx reference point.
\- Own PCRF pre-configured information.
The PCRF shall inform the TDF through the use of ADC rules, if applicable, on
the treatment of applications, in accordance with the PCRF policy decisions.
It is PCRF\'s responsibility to coordinate the PCC rules and QoS rules, if
applicable, with ADC rules in order to ensure consistent service delivery.
### 4b.4.2 TDF
The TDF (Traffic Detection Function) is a functional entity that performs
application\'s traffic detection and reporting of the detected application by
using TDF application identifier and its TDF application instance identifier
and its service data flow descriptions to the PCRF when service data flow
descriptions are deducible. The TDF shall support solicited application
reporting and/or unsolicited application reporting.
The TDF shall detect start and stop of the application traffic for the ADC
rules that the PCRF has activated at the TDF (solicited application reporting)
or which are pre-provisioned at the TDF (unsolicited application reporting).
When the APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP event trigger are subscribed,
the TDF shall report, unless the notification is muted for the specific ADC
rule in case of solicited application reporting, to the PCRF:
\- For the APPLICATION_START event trigger: the application identifier and,
when service data flow descriptions are deducible, the application instance
identifier and the service data flow descriptions to use for detecting that
application traffic with a dynamic PCC rule.
\- For the APPLICATION_STOP event trigger: the application identifier and if
the application instance identifier was reported for the start, also the
application instance identifier.
For the solicited application reporting, the TDF shall perform the following
enforcement actions to the detected application traffic, if requested by PCRF:
\- Gating;
\- Redirection;
\- Bandwidth limitation.
For the solicited application reporting, the TDF shall support usage
monitoring as specified in clauses 4b.5.6 and 4b.5.7.
For unsolicited application reporting, the TDF shall only perform application
detection and reporting functionality.
NOTE: For unsolicited application reporting, the TDF does not perform
enforcement actions and usage monitoring.
## 4b.5 ADC procedures over Sd reference point for solicited application
reporting
### 4b.5.1 Provisioning of ADC rules
#### 4b.5.1.1 General
If PCRF decides, based on subscriber\'s profile configuration, that the TDF
session should be established with the TDF per corresponding IP-CAN session,
during the IP-CAN session establishment or at any point of time when the PCRF
decides that the session with TDF is to be established (e.g. subscriber
profile changes), the PCRF shall indicate via the Sd reference point, the ADC
rules to be applied at the TDF. The TDF-Information AVP shall be either
received over Gx within initial CC-Request received from PCEF or pre-
provisioned at PCRF. Each ADC rule shall include TDF-Application-Identifier
AVP which references the corresponding application for which the rule applies.
When establishing the session with the TDF, the PCRF shall send a TS-Request
with the PDN information, if available, within the Called-Station-Id AVP, the
UE Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address and/or the UE Ipv6 prefix within
the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP. These parameters shall uniquely identify the
session between the PCRF and the TDF. Additionally, if available (i.e.
received from the PCEF or the BBERF), the PCRF may include the following
information: the user identification within the Subscription-Id AVP, the type
of IP-CAN within the IP-CAN-Type AVP, the type of the radio access technology
within the RAT-Type AVP if applicable, the device information within User-
Equipment-Info AVP, the SGSN address within either 3GPP-SGSN-Address AVP or
3GPP-SGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP, the user location information within 3GPP-User-
Location-Info or within 3GPP2-BSID, the Routing Area Identity within RAI AVP,
the Ipv4 and/ or Ipv6 address(es) of the access node gateway (SGW for 3GPP and
AGW for non-3GPP networks) in the AN-GW-Address AVPs, the MCC and the MNC of
the SGSN/S-GW in the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP, and the UE time zone information
within 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP. For xDSL IP-CAN Type, the Logical-Access-ID AVP
and the Physical-Access-ID AVP may be provided.
NOTE: For PDN type Ipv4v6, in case the UE Ipv4 address is not available in the
PCRF , the PCRF initiates the TDF session establishment providing the UE Ipv6
prefix, and will subsequently provide UE Ipv4 address to the TDF using Event-
Report-Indication AVP (as specified in clause 4b.5.8) to the TDF.
The ADC rules may be transferred to the TDF by using one of the following
procedures:
\- PUSH procedure (Unsolicited provisioning): The PCRF may decide to provision
ADC rules at TDF session establishment within TS-Request or at any point of
time within active TDF session by using RA-Request. To provision ADC rules,
the PCRF shall include those ADC rules in either TS-Request or RA-Request
message; or
\- PULL procedure (Provisioning solicited by the TDF): In response to a
request for ADC rules being made by the TDF, as described in the clause
4b.5.2, the PCRF shall provision ADC rules in the CC-Answer.
For each request from the TDF or upon the unsolicited provision, the PCRF
shall provision zero or more ADC rules. The PCRF may perform an operation on a
single ADC rule by one of the following means:
\- To activate or deactivate an ADC rule that is predefined at the TDF, the
PCRF shall provision a reference to this ADC rule within an ADC-Rule-Name AVP
and indicate the required action by choosing either the ADC-Rule-Install AVP
or the ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
\- To install or modify a PCRF-provisioned ADC rule, the PCRF shall provision
a corresponding ADC-Rule-Definition AVP within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP.
\- To remove an ADC rule which has previously been provisioned by the PCRF,
the PCRF shall provision the name of this ADC rule as value of an ADC-Rule-
Name AVP within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
As an alternative to providing a single ADC rule, the PCRF may provide an ADC-
Rule-Base-Name AVP within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP or the ADC-Rule-Remove AVP
as a reference to a group of ADC rules predefined at the TDF. With an ADC-
Rule-Install AVP, a predefined group of ADC rules is activated. With an ADC-
Rule-Remove AVP, a predefined group of ADC rules is deactivated.
The PCRF may combine multiple of the above ADC rule operations in a single
command.
To activate a predefined ADC rule at the TDF, the rule name within an ADC-
Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Install AVP as a reference
to the predefined rule. To activate a group of predefined ADC rules within the
TDF, an ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Install
AVP as a reference to the group of predefined ADC rules.
To install a new or modify an already installed PCRF defined ADC rule, the
ADC-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used. If an ADC rule with the same rule name,
as supplied in the ADC-Rule-Name AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP,
already exists at the TDF, the new ADC rule shall update the currently
installed rule. If the existing ADC rule already has attributes also included
in the new ADC rule definition, the existing attributes shall be overwritten.
Any attribute in the existing ADC rule not included in the new ADC rule
definition shall remain valid.
For deactivating single predefined or removing PCRF-provided ADC rules, the
ADC-Rule-Name AVP shall be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP. For
deactivating a group of predefined ADC rules, the ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP shall
be supplied within an ADC-Rule-Remove AVP.
The TDF shall apply the ADC rules to the user plane traffic with the IP
address(es) matching the UE Ipv4 address within the Framed-IP-Address and/or
the UE Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP received over Sd
interface and report the detected 74ultiple74n74 information via the
corresponding TDF session.
If the provisioning of ADC rules fails, the TDF informs the PCRF as described
in Clause 4b.5.5 ADC Rule Error Handling. Depending on the cause, the PCRF may
decide if re-installation, modification, removal of ADC rules or any other
action applies.
#### 4b.5.1.2 Gate function
The Gate Function represents a user plane function enabling or disabling the
forwarding of application\'s traffic. A gate is applicable to the detected
application\'s traffic. The Flow-Status AVP of the ADC rule shall describe if
the possible uplink and possible downlink gate for the detected application\'s
traffic is opened or closed.
The commands to open or close the gate shall lead to the enabling or disabling
of the passage for corresponding detected application\'s traffic
uplink/downlink. If the corresponding uplink and/or downlink gate is closed,
all packets belonging to the detected application\'s traffic uplink and/or
downlink shall be dropped. If the corresponding uplink and/or downlink gate is
opened, all packets belonging to the detected application\'s traffic uplink
and/or downlink are allowed to be forwarded.
#### 4b.5.1.3 Bandwidth limitation function
The PCRF can provide the maximum allowed bit rate (QoS) for an ADC rule to the
TDF. The Provisioning shall be performed using the ADC rule provisioning
procedure. The allowed QoS shall be encoded using a QoS-Information AVP within
the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP of the ADC rule. If QoS-Information is provided
for an ADC rule, the TDF shall enforce the corresponding policy for the
detected application\'s traffic. Only the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVP and
the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-DL AVP shall be used.
#### 4b.5.1.4 Redirect function
The PCRF may provide the redirect instruction (e.g. redirect the detected
application\'s traffic to another controlled address) for a dynamic ADC rule
to the TDF. The Provisioning shall be performed using the ADC rule
provisioning procedure. The redirect instruction shall be encoded using a
Redirect-Information AVP within the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP of the dynamic ADC
rule.
For a dynamic ADC rule, the redirect address may be provided as part of the
dynamic ADC rule or may be preconfigured in the TDF. A redirect destination
provided within the Redirect-Server-Address AVP in a dynamic ADC Rule shall
override the redirect destination preconfigured in the TDF for this ADC Rule.
NOTE: The TDF uses the preconfigured redirection address only if it can be
applied to the application traffic being detected, e.g. the redirection
destination address could be preconfigured on a per application identifier
basis.
If Redirect-Information AVP is provided for a dynamic ADC rule, the TDF shall
implement the redirection for the detected application\'s uplink traffic. If
the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is provided within.the Redirect-Information
AVP and the Redirect-Support AVP is not set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED, the TDF
shall redirect the detected application\'s uplink traffic to this address. In
this case, the redirect address type (e.g. Ipv4, Ipv6, URL) shall be defined
by the Redirect-Address-Type AVP. If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not
provided, the redirection address preconfigured in the TDF shall be used
instead. .If the Redirect-Server-Address AVP is not provided and the
redirection address is not preconfigured in the TDF for the ADC rule, the TDF
shall perform ADC Rule Error Handling as specified in clause 4b.5.5.
When the PCRF wants to disable the redirect function for an already installed
ADC Rule, the PCRF shall update the ADC rule including the Redirect-
Information AVP with Redirect-Support AVP set to REDIRECTION_DISABLED.
#### 4b.5.1.5 Usage Monitoring Control
Usage monitoring may be performed for application (s) associated with one or
more ADC rules.
The provisioning of usage monitoring control per ADC rule shall be performed
using the ADC rule provisioning procedure. For a dynamic ADC rule, the
monitoring key shall be set using the Monitoring-Key AVP within the ADC-Rule-
Definition AVP of the ADC rule. For a predefined ADC rule, the monitoring key
shall be included in the rule definition at the TDF.
### 4b.5.2 Request for ADC rules
The TDF shall indicate, via the Sd reference point, a request for ADC rules
during the active TDF session established with PCRF, when a provisioned Event
trigger is met. The TDF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set
to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\". Additionally, the TDF shall supply the
specific event which caused the request (within the Event-Trigger AVP) and any
previously provisioned affected ADC rule(s) The ADC rules and their status
shall be supplied to PCRF within the ADC-Rule-Report AVP.
ADC rules can also be requested as a consequence of a failure in the ADC rule
installation/activation or enforcement without requiring an Event-Trigger. For
the additional information see clause 4b.5.5.
### 4b.5.3 Provisioning of Event Triggers
The PCRF may provide one or several event triggers within one or several
Event-Trigger AVP to the TDF using the ADC rule provision procedure. Event
triggers may be used to determine which event causes the TDF to inform PCRF
once occur. Provisioning of event triggers from the PCRF to the TDF shall be
done at TDF session level. The Event-Trigger AVP may be provided in
combination with the initial or subsequent ADC rule provisioning in TSR, RAR
or CCA message.
The PCRF may add new event triggers or remove the already provided ones. In
order to do so, the PCRF shall provide the new complete list of applicable
event triggers including the needed provisioned Event-Trigger AVPs in the CCA
or RARcommands.
The PCRF may remove all previously provided event triggers by providing the
Event-Trigger AVP set to the value NO_EVENT_TRIGGERS. When an Event-Trigger
AVP is provided with this value, no other Event-Trigger AVP shall be provided
in the CCA or RAR command. Upon reception of an Event-Trigger AVP with this
value, the TDF shall not inform PCRF of any event.
If no Event-Trigger AVP is included in a CCA or RAR operation, any previously
provisioned event trigger shall still be applicable.
### 4b.5.4 Request of TDF Session Termination
When the corresponding IP-CAN session is terminated or at any point of time
when the PCRF decides that the session with TDF is to be terminated (e.g.
subscriber profile changes), the PCRF shall send a RAR command including the
Session-Release-Cause AVP to the TDF. The TDF shall acknowledge the command by
sending a RAA command to the PCRF and instantly remove/deactivate all the ADC
rules that have been previously installed or activated on that TDF session.
The TDF shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" to PCRF to terminate the TDF session.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the TDF.
NOTE 1: According to DCC procedures, the Diameter Credit Control session is
being terminated with this message exchange, as specified in IETF RFC 4006
[9].
Signalling flows for the TDF session termination are presented in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
### 4b.5.5 ADC Rule Error Handling
If the installation/activation of one or more ADC rules fails, the TDF shall
include one or more ADC-Rule-Report AVP(s) in either a TSA, a CCR or an RAA
command as described below for the affected ADC rules. Within each ADC-Rule-
Report AVP, the TDF shall identify the failed ADC rule(s) by including the
ADC-Rule-Name AVP(s) or ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP(s), shall identify the failed
reason code by including a Rule-Failure-Code AVP, and shall include the PCC-
Rule-Status AVP as described below:
\- If the installation/activation of one or more ADC rules fails using a PUSH
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using TSR or RAR command), the
TDF shall communicate the failure to the PCRF in the corresponding TSA/RAA
response.
\- If the installation/activation of one or more ADC rules fails using a PULL
mode (i.e., the PCRF installs/activates a rule using a CCA command), the TDF
shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and include the Rule-Failure-Code AVP.
If the installation/activation of one or more new ADC rules (i.e., rules which
were not previously successfully installed) fails, the TDF shall set the PCC-
Rule-Status to INACTIVE for both the PUSH and the PULL modes.
If the modification of a currently active ADC rule using PUSH mode fails, the
TDF shall retain the existing ADC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing ADC rule.
The TDF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the TSA/RAA
command.
If the modification of a currently active ADC rule using PULL mode fails, the
TDF shall retain the existing ADC rule as active without any modification
unless the reason for the failure has an impact also on the existing ADC rule.
The TDF shall report the modification failure to the PCRF using the CCR
command.
Depending on the value of the Rule-Failure-Code for PULL and PUSH mode, the
PCRF may decide whether retaining of the old ADC rule, re-installation,
modification, removal of the ADC rule or any other action applies.
If an ADC rule was successfully installed/activated, but can no longer be
enforced by the TDF, the TDF shall send the PCRF a new CCR command and include
an ADC-Rule-Report AVP. The TDF shall include the Rule-Failure-Code AVP within
the ADC-Rule-Report AVP and shall set the PCC-Rule-Status to INACTIVE.
### 4b.5.6 Requesting Usage Monitoring Control
The PCRF may indicate, via the Sd reference point, the need to apply
monitoring control for the accumulated usage of network resources on a per TDF
session basis. Usage is defined as volume of user plane traffic. The data
collection for usage monitoring control shall be performed per monitoring key,
which may apply to one application (i.e. the monitoring key is used by a
single ADC rule), or to several applications (i.e., the monitoring key is used
by many ADC rules), or all detected traffic belonging to a specific TDF
session.
If the PCRF requests usage monitoring control and if at this time, the PCRF is
not subscribed to the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger, the PCRF shall include
the Event-Trigger AVP, set to the value \"USAGE_REPORT\", in a TS-Request, CC-
Answer or RA-Request.
At TDF session establishment and modification, the PCRF may provide the
applicable thresholds for usage monitoring control to the TDF, together with
the respective monitoring keys. To provide the initial threshold for one or
more monitoring key(s), the PCRF may include the threshold in either TSR, RAR
or in the response of a CCR, initiated by the TDF.
During the IP-CAN session establishment, the PCRF may receive information
about total allowed usage per PDN and/ or per UE from the SPR, i.e. the
overall amount of allowed traffic volume that are to be monitored for the PDN
connections of a user and/or total allowed usage for Monitoring key(s) per PDN
and UE and should use it when making a decisions about usage monitoring
control.
In order to provide the applicable threshold for usage monitoring control, the
PCRF shall include a Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key. The
threshold level shall be provided in its Granted-Service-Unit AVP. Threshold
levels may be defined for:
\- the total volume only; or
\- the uplink volume only; or
\- the downlink volume only; or
\- the uplink and downlink volume.
The PCRF shall provide the applicable threshold(s) in the CC-Total-Octets, CC-
Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVPs of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP. The
monitoring key shall be provided in the Monitoring-Key AVP. The PCRF may
provide multiple usage monitoring control instances. The PCRF shall indicate
if the usage monitoring instance applies to the TDF session or to one or more
ADC rules. For this purpose, the Usage-Monitoring-Level AVP may be provided
with a value respectively set to SESSION_LEVEL or ADC_RULE_LEVEL. The PCRF may
provide one usage monitoring control instance applicable at TDF session level
and one or more usage monitoring instances applicable at ADC Rule level.
The PCRF may provide a Monitoring-Time AVP to the TDF for the monitoring
keys(s) in order to receive reports for the accumulated usage before and after
the monitoring time occurs within the report triggered by the events defined
in 4b.5.7.2-4b.5.7.6. In such a case, there may be two instances of Granted-
Service-Unit AVP within Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP per monitoring key.
One of them indicates the threshold levels before the monitoring time occurs,
and the other one, which includes Monitoring-Time AVP, indicates the
subsequent threshold levels after the monitoring time occurs.The detailed
functionality in such a case is defined by 4b.5.7.7.
If the PCRF wishes to modify the threshold level for one or more monitoring
keys, the PCRF shall provide the thresholds for all the different levels
applicable to the corresponding monitoring key(s).
If the PCRF wishes to modify the monitoring key for the TDF session level
usage monitoring instance, it shall disable the existing session level
monitoring usage instance following the procedures defined in 4b.5.7.4 and
shall provide a new TDF session level usage monitoring instance following the
procedures defined in this clause. The PCRF may enable the new TDF session
level usage monitoring instance and disable the existing TDF session level
usage monitoring instance in the same command.
When the accumulated usage is reported in a CCR command, the PCRF shall
indicate to the TDF if usage monitoring shall continue for that TDF session,
usage monitoring key, or both as follows:
\- If monitoring shall continue for specific level(s), the PCRF shall provide
the new thresholds for the level(s) in the CC-Answer using the same AVP as
before (CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-Output-Octets AVP within the
Granted-Service-Unit AVP);
\- otherwise, if the PCRF wishes to stop monitoring for specific level(s) the
PCRF shall not include an updated usage threshold in the CCA command for the
stopped level(s) i.e. the corresponding CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets or
CC-Output-Octets AVPs shall not be included within Granted-Service-Units AVP.
When usage monitoring is enabled, the PCRF may request the TDF to report
accumulated usage for all enabled monitoring or selected monitoring keys
regardless if a usage threshold has been reached by sending to the TDF within
the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP the Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to
the value USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED. The PCRF shall only require TDF to
report accumulated usage for one or more monitoring keys in a CC-Answer when
the TDF has not provided accumulated usage in the CC-Request for the same
monitoring key(s).
To specify the usage monitoring key for which usage is requested, the PCRF
shall include the usage monitoring key within the Monitoring-Key AVP within
the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. To request usage be reported for all
enabled usage monitoring keys, the PCRF shall omit the Monitoring-Key.
The PCRF shall process the usage reports and shall perform the actions as
appropriate for each report.
### 4b.5.7 Reporting Accumulated Usage
#### 4b.5.7.1 General
When usage monitoring is enabled, the TDF shall measure the volume of the TDF
session or the volume of the particular application (s), and report
accumulated usage to the PCRF in the following conditions:
\- when a usage threshold is reached;
\- when all ADC rules for which usage monitoring is enabled for a particular
usage monitoring key are removed or deactivated;
\- when usage monitoring is explicitly disabled by the PCRF;
\- when a TDF session is terminated;
\- when requested by the PCRF.
To report accumulated usage for a specific monitoring key, the TDF shall send
a CC-Request with the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
accumulated usage since the last report. The Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP
shall include the monitoring key in the Monitoring-Key AVP and the accumulated
volume usage in the Used-Service-Unit AVP. Accumulated volume reporting shall
be done for the total volume, the uplink volume or the downlink volume as
requested by the PCRF, and set in CC-Total-Octets, CC-Input-Octets or CC-
Output-Octets AVPs of Used-Service-Unit AVP respectively. The TDF shall
continue to perform volume measurement after the report until instructed by
the PCRF to stop the monitoring.
In case a Monitoring-Time AVP was provided by the PCRF within one instance of
the Granted-Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information
AVP for the usage monitoring control request, the PCEF shall report as defined
in 4b.5.7.7.
For cases, where the PCRF indicates in a CC-Answer command whether the usage
monitoring shall continue as a response to the reporting of accumulated usage
in a CCR command, the TDF shall behave as follows:
\- if the PCRF provisions an updated usage threshold in the CCA command, the
monitoring continues using the updated threshold value provisioned by the
PCRF;
\- otherwise, if the PCRF does not include an updated usage threshold in the
CCA command, the TDF shall not continue usage monitoring for that TDF session,
usage monitoring key, or both as applicable.
NOTE: When the PCRF indicates that usage monitoring shall not continue in the
CCA, the TDF does not report usage which has accumulated between sending the
CCR and receiving the CCA.
Upon receiving the reported usage from the TDF, the PCRF shall deduct the
value of the usage report from the total allowed usage for that IP-CAN
session, usage monitoring key, or both as applicable, and the PCRF may also
derive the ADC rules based on the remaining allowed usage or reported usage
and provision them to the TDF.
Additional procedures for each of the scenarios above are described in the
following clauses of 4b.5.7.
#### 4b.5.7.2 Usage Threshold Reached
When usage monitoring is enabled for a particular monitoring key, the TDF
shall measure the volume of all traffic for the TDF session or the
corresponding application (s) and notify the PCRF when a usage threshold for
that monitoring key is reached and report the accumulated usage for that
monitoring key and include the \"USAGE_REPORT\" Event-Trigger in a CCR command
with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\" by following the
procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause 4b.5.7.1.
#### 4b.5.7.3 ADC Rule Removal
When the PCRF removes or deactivates the last ADC rule associated with a usage
monitoring key in an RAR or CCA command in response to a CCR command not
related to reporting usage for the same monitoring key, the TDF shall send a
new CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\"
including the Event-Trigger set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report accumulated
usage for the usage monitoring key within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP
using the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in clause 4b.5.7.1.
When the TDF reports that the last ADC rule associated with a usage monitoring
key is inactive, the TDF shall report the accumulated usage for that
monitoring key within the same CCR command if the ADC-Rule-Report AVP was
included in a CCR command; otherwise, if the ADC-Rule-Report AVP was included
in an RAA command, the TDF shall send a new CCR command to report accumulated
usage for the usage monitoring key.
#### 4b.5.7.4 Usage Monitoring Disabled
Once enabled, the PCRF may explicitly disable usage monitoring as a result of
receiving a CCR from the TDF which is not related to reporting usage, but
related to other external triggers (e.g. subscriber profile update), or a PCRF
internal trigger. When the PCRF disables usage monitoring, the TDF shall
report the accumulated usage which has occurred while usage monitoring was
enabled since the last report.
To disable usage monitoring for a monitoring key, the PCRF shall send the
Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including only the applicable monitoring key
within the Monitoring-Key AVP and the Usage-Monitoring-Support AVP set to
USAGE_MONITORING_DISABLED.
When the PCRF disables usage monitoring in a RAR or CCA command, the TDF shall
send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report
accumulated usage for the disabled usage monitoring key(s).
#### 4b.5.7.5 TDF Session Termination
At TDF session termination, the TDF shall send the accumulated usage
information for all monitoring keys for which usage monitoring is enabled in
the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\" using the procedures to report accumulated usage
defined in clause 4b.5.7.1.
#### 4b.5.7.6 PCRF Requested Usage Report
When the TDF receives the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP including the
Usage-Monitoring-Report AVP set to the value USAGE_MONITORING_REPORT_REQUIRED,
the TDF shall send a new CCR command with CC-Request Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\" and the Event-Trigger AVP set to \"USAGE_REPORT\" to report
accumulated usage for the monitoring key received in the Usage-Monitoring-
Information AVP using the procedures to report accumulated usage defined in
clause 4b.5.7. If the Monitoring-Key AVP was omitted in the received Usage-
Monitoring-Information AVP, the TDF shall send the accumulated usage for all
the monitoring keys that were enabled at the time the Usage-Monitoring-
Information was received.
#### 4b.5.7.7 Report in case of Monitoring Time provided
If Monitoring-Time AVP was provided within one instance of the Granted-
Service-Unit AVP included within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP by the
PCRF, and if the TDF needs to report the accumulated usage when one of the
events defined in clause 4b.5.7.2-4b.5.7.6 occurs before the monitoring time,
the PCEF shall report the accumulated usage as defined clause
4b.5.7.2-4b.5.7.6 and the TDF shall not retain the monitoring time; otherwise,
\- If two instances of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP are provided by the PCRF,
the TDF shall reset the usage threshold to the value of the Granted-Service-
Unit AVP with the Monitoring-Time AVP.
\- If only one instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP is provided by the
PCRF, the TDF shall reset the usage threshold to the remaining value of the
Granted-Service-Unit AVP previously sent by the PCRF (i.e. excluding the
accumulated volume usage).
\- For both cases, the usage report from the TDF shall include two instances
of the Used-Service-Unit AVP, one of them to indicate the usage before the
monitoring time and the other one accompanied by the Monitoring-Time AVP under
the same Used-Service-Unit AVP to indicate the usage after the monitoring
time.
When PCRF receives the accumulated usage report in a CCR command, the PCRF
shall indicate to the TDF if usage monitoring shall continue as defined in
clause 4b.5.6. The PCRF may provide the Monitoring-Time AVP again within one
instance of the Granted-Service-Unit AVP if reports for the accumulated usage
before and after the provided monitoring time are required.
### 4b.5.8 Provisioning of Event Report Indication
The TDF may request from the PCRF to be informed about specific changes
occurred in the location information/access network information in either a
TSA, a CCR or an RAA command. In this case, the PCRF shall subscribe to the
appropriate event triggers in the PCEF according to clause 4.5.3 or in the
BBERF according to clause 4a.5.8.
NOTE 1: In case the IP flow mobility feature is enabled, the TDF doesn\'t have
accurate information about the location and the type of RAT the user is
attached to.
After receiving the reply of the event subscription from the PCEF or the
BBERF, the PCRF shall send the event related information to the TDF by using a
RAR command.
When PCRF is notified that an event is triggered in the PCEF or the BBERF, if
the TDF has previously requested to be informed of the specific event, the
PCRF shall notify the TDF about the event occurred together with additional
related information (i.e. the parameter value). This notification shall be
done by using the Event-Report-Indication AVP. There may be neither ADC Rule
provisioning nor Event Trigger provisioning together with event report
indication in this message.
When PCRF is notified by PCEF that either an UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE or an
UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE event of the IP-CAN session occurs in the PCEF, the PCRF
shall notify the TDF about the event for the corresponding TDF session. The
Framed-IP-Address AVP shall also be provided. This notification shall also be
done by using the Event-Report-Indication AVP within a RAR command. There may
be neither ADC Rules nor Event Triggers in this message. If the PCRF notifies
of the new Ipv4 address to the TDF, the TDF shall additional ly apply the ADC
rules to the user plane traffic with the IP address matching the new Ipv4
address and report the detected 80ultiple80n80 information via the
corresponding TDF session. If the PCRF notifies to the TDF that the Ipv4
address has been released, the TDF shall stop applying the ADC rule to the
user plane traffic with IP address matching the released Ipv4 address.
NOTE 2: The TDF does not need to subscribe the notification of the
UE_IP_ADDRESS_ALLOCATE and UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE.
Whenever the TDF subscribes to an event report indication by using the TSA,
CCR or RAA command, the PCRF shall only send the corresponding currently
applicable values which have been updated (e.g. 3GPP-User-Location-Info,
3GPP2-BSID, etc.) to the TDF in the RAR or CCA if available. In this case, the
Event-Trigger AVPs shall not be included.
NOTE 3: The PCRF can get the currently applicable values during the IP-CAN
session establishment procedure or during the information reporting from the
BBERF when the BBERF gets event subscription from the PCRF as defined in
clause 5.3.7.
### 4b.5.9 Application Detection Information
For the solicited application reporting, the PCRF may instruct the TDF to
detect application (s) by providing the ADC-Rule-Install AVP (s) with the
corresponding parameters as follows: the application to be detected is
identified by the TDF-Application-Identifier AVP, which is either provided
under ADC-Rule-Definition AVP for dynamic ADC Rules or pre-provisioned for the
corresponding predefined ADC Rule, and in such a case only ADC-Rule-Name/ADC-
Rule-Base-Name is provided . If the PCRF requires to be reported about when
the application start/stop is detected, it shall also subscribe to the
APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers. The PCRF may also mute
such a notification about a specific detected application by providing Mute-
Notification within the corresponding ADC-Rule-Definition AVP.
When the start or stop of the application\'s traffic, identified by TDF-
Application-Identifier, is detected, if PCRF has previously subscribed to the
APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, unless a request to mute
such a notification (Mute-Notification AVP ) is part of the corresponding ADC-
Rule-Definition AVP, the TDF shall report the information regarding the
detected application\'s traffic in the Application-Detection-Information AVP
in the CCR command.
The corresponding TDF-Application-Identifier AVP shall be included under
Application-Detection-Information AVP. When the Event trigger indicates
APPLICATION_START, the Flow-Information AVP for the detected application may
be included under Application-Detection-Information AVP, if deducible. The
Flow-Information AVP, if present, shall contain the Flow-Description AVP and
Flow-Direction AVP. The TDF-Application-Instance-Identifier, which is
dynamically assigned by the TDF in order to allow correlation of
APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers to the specific Flow-
Information AVP, if service data flow descriptions are deducible, shall also
be provided. Also, the corresponding Event-Trigger (APPLICATION_START or
APPLICATION_STOP) shall be provided to PCRF. When the TDF-Application-
Instance-Identifier is provided along with the APPLICATION_START, it shall
also be provided along with the corresponding APPLICATION_STOP. The PCRF then
may make the policy decision based on the information received and send the
updated PCC rules to the PCEF, updated QoS rules to the BBERF, if applicable,
and the updated ADC rules to the TDF.
### 4b.5.10 Time of the day procedures
TDF shall be able to perform ADC rule request based on time as instructed by
the PCRF in a TSR, CCA or a RAR commands. To do so, the PCRF shall provide the
Event-Trigger AVP with the value REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT (17) if the event
trigger is not previously set and in addition the Revalidation-Time when set
by the PCRF. This shall cause the TDF to trigger a PCRF interaction to request
ADC rules from the PCRF for an established TDF session. The TDF shall stop the
timer once the TDF triggers an REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event.
PCRF shall be able to provide a new value for the revalidation timeout by
including Revalidation-Time in CCA or RAR. The PCRF may provide the
Revalidation-Time AVP together with the event trigger REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT or
in a subsequent ADC rule provisioning.
PCRF shall be able to stop the ADC revalidation timer by disabling the
REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT event trigger.
NOTE 1: By disabling the REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT the revalidation time value
previously provided to the TDF is not applicable anymore.
The PCRF may control at what time the status of an ADC rule changes.
1) If Rule-Activation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the TDF shall set the ADC rule inactive and make it active at that time. If
Rule-Activation-Time has passed, then the TDF shall immediately set the ADC
rule active.
2) If Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified only and has not yet occurred, then
the TDF shall set the ADC rule active and make it inactive at that time. If
Rule-Deactivation-Time has passed, then the TDF shall immediately set the ADC
rule inactive.
3) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, and also
when the ADC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, the TDF shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then as
defined in 2).
4) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified, and
the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, and also
when the ADC rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Rule-
Activation-Time., the TDF shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as
defined in 1).
5) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-
Deactivation-Time, then the TDF shall immediately set the ADC rule inactive.
6) If both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time are specified but
time has passed for both, and the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the
Rule-Activation-Time, then the PCEF shall immediately set the ADC rule active.
ADC Rule Activation or Deactivation shall not generate any CCR commands with
ADC-Rule-Report since PCRF is already aware of the state of the rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified in the ADC-
Rule-Install, then it shall replace the previously set values for the
specified ADC rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time AVP, Rule-Deactivation-Time AVP or both AVPs are
omitted, then any previous value for the omitted AVP is no longer valid.
The 3GPP-MS-TimeZone AVP, if available, may be used by the PCRF and by the TDF
to derive the Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time.
### 4b.5.11 PCRF Failure and Restoration
If the TDF needs to send a TDF Session update request (e.g. following usage
threshold reached) towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the
TDF Session establishment, the TDF should not send the TDF Session update
request towards a PCRF, and the TDF may clean up the TDF session related
information.
NOTE 1: This mechanism in the TDF removes all application traffic control on
the PDN connection and has no effect on the state of the PDN connection. It is
expected that the PCEF will perform the same detection and clean up of PDN
connections affected by the PCRF failure and restoration.
NOTE 2: The method the TDF uses to determine that a PCRF has restarted is not
specified in this release.
## 4b.5a ADC procedures over Sd reference point for unsolicited application
reporting
### 4b.5a.1 Provisioning of ADC rules
#### 4b.5a.1.1 General
If a TDF is configured for unsolicited reporting, the TDF is pre-configured
with ADC rules which specify which applications to detect and report. These
rules are always active and are not controlled by the PCRF.
### 4b.5a.2 Application Detection Information
When the start or stop of the application\'s traffic, identified by TDF-
Application-Identifier, is detected, the TDF shall report the information
regarding the detected application\'s traffic in the Application-Detection-
Information AVP in the CCR command.
1) When the TDF detects an application for an Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address for
which a TDF session does not exist, the TDF shall send CC-Request with CC-
Request-Type set to value \"INITIAL-REQUEST\". The TDF provides the full UE IP
address using either Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP and, if
available, the PDN identifier. The corresponding CCA may contain the Ipv6
prefix within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVPs if the established TDF session is
Ipv6 address related.
2) When an application is detected for an Ipv4 address or Ipv6 Prefix for
which a TDF session already exists, the TDF shall send CC-Request with CC-
Request-Type set to value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\".
NOTE: It is considered that a TDF session exists for a detected application
related to an Ipv6 address if the Ipv6 address belongs to the Ipv6 prefix
provided by the PCRF for that TDF session.
The corresponding TDF-Application-Identifier AVP shall be included under
Application-Detection-Information AVP. Also, the corresponding Event-Trigger
(APPLICATION_START or APPLICATION_STOP) shall be provided to PCRF. When the
Event trigger indicates APPLICATION_START, if deducible, the Flow-Information
AVP for the detected application shall be included under Application-
Detection-Information AVP. The Flow-Information AVP, if present, shall contain
the Flow-Description AVP and Flow-Direction AVP. The TDF-Application-Instance-
Identifier, which is dynamically assigned by the TDF in order to allow
correlation of APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers to the
specific Flow-Information AVP, if service data flow descriptions are
deducible, shall also be provided.
### 4b.5a.3 Request of TDF Session Termination
In the unsolicited reporting case the session termination procedure as defined
in clause 4b.5.4 is initiated in the following cases.
\- the corresponding IP-CAN session is terminated;
\- the Ipv4 address of a dual stack IP-CAN session is released and there is an
active Ipv4 address related TDF session for that IP-CAN session;
\- at any point of time when the PCRF decides that the session with TDF is to
be terminated (e.g. subscriber profile changes).
### 4b.5a.4 TDF session to Gx session linking
When the PCRF receives the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the PCRF links the TDF session to a Gx session, if
the Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address of the TDF session matches the Ipv4 address
or Ipv6 prefix of the Gx session. The PDN information if available in the
Called-Station-Id AVP may also be used for this session linking.
The TDF should handle each Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix, assuming the max
prefix length used in the access network, within a separate TDF session. The
PCRF shall link the separate Ipv4 address related TDF session and Ipv6 address
related TDF session to the same IP-CAN session and correlate the TDF sessions.
NOTE 1: In the scenario where the TDF performs initial Application Detection
on 83ultiple simultaneous traffic flows for the same Ipv6 prefix (i.e. two or
more traffic flows from Ipv6 addresses of the same IP-CAN session) the TDF
could not be aware that those flows belong to the same IP-CAN session until a
response is received from the PCRF, containing the Ipv6 prefix. This leads to
using separate TDF sessions for the Ipv6 addresses for the same IP-CAN
session. The TDF reports new application detection information related to that
Ipv6 prefix via any of the TDF sessions at a later stage.
# 5 Gx protocol
## 5.1 Protocol support
The Gx protocol in the present release is based on Gx protocol defined for
Release 6 as specified in 3GPP TS 29.210 [2]. However, due to a new paradigm
(DCC session for an IP-CAN session) between Release 6 and the present release,
the Gx application in the present release has an own vendor specific Diameter
application.
The Gx application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application, where
the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the Gx Application in the
present release is 16777238. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) must be configured appropriately to identify
the 3GPP Gx application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order to create
suitable routeing tables.
Due to the definition of the commands used in Gx protocol, there is no
possibility to skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP instead. Therefore the Gx application identification shall
be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the Gx interface, the PCRF
acts as a Diameter server, in the sense that it is the network element that
handles PCC Rule requests for a particular realm. The PCEF acts as the
Diameter client, in the sense that is the network element requesting PCC rules
in the transport plane network resources.
## 5.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each PCRF and
PCEF pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance
of connections between Diameter nodes is described in RFC 3588 [5].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the PCEF shall
advertise the support of the Gx specific Application by including the value of
the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilities‑Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (RFC 3588 [5]).
The termination of the Diameter session on Gx can be initiated either by the
PCEF or PCRF, as specified in clauses 4.5.7 and 4.5.9, respectively.
## 5.3 Gx specific AVPs
Table 5.3.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Gx reference point,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the AVP may
be encrypted, what access types (e.g. 3GPP-GPRS, etc.) the AVP is applicable
to, the applicability of the AVPs to charging control, policy control or both,
and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. The Vendor-Id header of
all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to 3GPP (10415).

### 5.3.1 Bearer-Usage AVP (3GPP-GPRS and 3GPP-EPS access types)
The Bearer-Usage AVP (AVP code 1000) is of type Enumerated, and it shall
indicate how the bearer is being used. If the Bearer-Usage AVP has not been
previously provided, its absence shall indicate that no specific information
is available. If the Bearer-Usage AVP has been provided, its value shall
remain valid until it is provided the next time. The following values are
defined:
GENERAL (0)
This value shall indicate no specific bearer usage information is available.
IMS_SIGNALLING (1)
This value shall indicate that the bearer is used for IMS signalling only.
### 5.3.2 Charging-Rule-Install AVP (All access types)
The Charging-Rule-Install AVP (AVP code 1001) is of type Grouped, and it is
used to activate, install or modify PCC rules as instructed from the PCRF to
the PCEF.
For installing a new PCC rule or modifying a PCC rule already installed,
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP shall be used.
For activating a specific PCC rule predefined at the PCEF, Charging-Rule-Name
AVP shall be used as a reference for that PCC rule. The Charging-Rule-Base-
Name AVP is a reference that may be used for activating a group of PCC rules
predefined at the PCEF.
For GPRS scenarios where the bearer binding is performed by the PCRF, the
Bearer Identifier AVP shall be included as part of Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
If present within Charging-Rule-Install AVP, the Bearer-Identifier AVP
indicates that the PCC rules within this Charging-Rule-Install AVP shall be
installed or activated within the IP CAN bearer identified by the Bearer-
Identifier AVP.
If no Bearer-Identifier AVP is included within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP,
the PCEF shall select an IP CAN bearer for each of the PCC rules within this
Charging-Rule-Install AVP, were the PCC rule is installed or activated.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified then it applies
to all the PCC rules within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP.
If Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP is included then it applies to all the
rules within the Charging-Rule-Install AVP. If a Charging-Rule-Install AVP
does not include the Resource-Allocation-Notification AVP, the resource
allocation shall not be notified by the PCEF even if this AVP was present in
previous installations of the same rule.
If the Charging-Correlation-Indicator AVP is included within the Charging-
Rule-Install AVP, it indicates that the PCEF shall provide the assigned access
network charging identifier for the dynamic PCC Rules that are provided in the
Charging-Rule-Definition AVP(s) within the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-
Gx AVP.

### 5.3.3 Charging-Rule-Remove AVP (All access types)
The Charging-Rule-Remove AVP (AVP code 1002) is of type Grouped, and it is
used to deactivate or remove PCC rules from an IP CAN session.
Charging-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific PCC rule at the PCEF to
be removed or for a specific PCC rule predefined at the PCEF to be
deactivated. The Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP is a reference for a group of PCC
rules predefined at the PCEF to be deactivated.
Required-Access-Info AVP may be included if the AF requests the PCRF to report
access network information and the PCRF is removing PCC rules based on the AF
requests.
AVP Format:

### 5.3.4 Charging-Rule-Definition AVP (All access types)
The Charging-Rule-Definition AVP (AVP code 1003) is of type Grouped, and it
defines the PCC rule sent by the PCRF to the PCEF. The Charging-Rule-Name AVP
uniquely identifies the PCC rule and it is used to reference to a PCC rule in
communication between the PCEF and the PCRF within one IP CAN session. The
Flow-Information AVP(s) or the application detection filter referenced by the
TDF-Application-Identifier AVP determines the traffic that belongs to the
service data flow. Either Flow-Information AVP(s) or TDF-Application-
Identifier AVP shall exist in a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP.
If optional AVP(s) within a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP are omitted, but
corresponding information has been provided in previous Gx messages, the
previous information remains valid. If Flow-Information AVP(s) are supplied,
they replace all previous Flow-Information AVP(s). If Flows AVP(s) are
supplied, they replace all previous Flows AVP(s).
The PS-to-CS-Session-Continuity AVP indicates if a service data flow is a
candidate for PS to CS session continuity.
Flows AVP may appear if and only if AF-Charging-Identifier AVP is also
present.
AF-Signalling-Protocol AVP may appear if the PCC Rule applies for IMS
signalling.
Monitoring-Key AVP contains the monitoring key that may apply to the PCC rule.
Mute-Notification status shall not be changed during the lifetime of the PCC
rules.
Sponsor-Identity AVP and Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP shall be
included if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value
SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL for the service data flow.
Required-Access-Info AVP may appear if the AF requests PCRF to report user
access network information.

### 5.3.11 Precedence AVP (All access types)
The Precedence AVP (AVP code 1010) is of type Unsigned32.
Within the Charging Rule Definition AVP, the Precedence AVP determines the
order, in which service data flow templates consisting of service data flow
filters are applied at service data flow detection at the PCEF. For PCC rules
with an application detection filter, the Precedence AVP only determines which
PCC rule is applicable for the detected application for the enforcement of
QoS, for charging control, for reporting of application start and stop and for
usage monitoring. A PCC rule with the Precedence AVP with lower value shall be
applied before a PCC rule with the Precedence AVP with higher value.
NOTE 1: For PCRF-initiated IP-CAN session modification cases where the PCEF
creates new service data flow filters (e.g. mapping into new TFT-UL filters),
the PCEF need to make an appropriate mapping between the value of the
Precedence AVP from the PCC rule and the precedence information of the traffic
mapping information filter. The PCEF have to maintain the order of the
precedence information provided by the PCRF for the PCC rules with the
precedence information of the new traffic mapping information filters. For UE-
initiated IP-CAN session modification cases, according to 3GPP TS 23.060 [17],
the precedence of the traffic mapping information filter provided by the UE is
not modified by the PCEF. Also see access specific annexes for mapping of
Precedence AVP from the PCC rule and the precedence information of the traffic
mapping information filter.
NOTE 2: The precedence value range defined within the PCC rule is operator
configurable and can be set based on the IP-CAN type.
The Precedence AVP is also used within the TFT-Packet-Filter-Information AVP
to indicate the evaluation precedence of the Traffic Mapping Information
filters (for GPRS the TFT packet filters) as received from the UE. The PCEF
shall assign a lower value in the corresponding Precedence AVP to a Traffic
Mapping Information filter with a higher evaluation precedence than to a
Traffic Mapping Information filter with a lower evaluation precedence.
The Precedence AVP is also used within the Routing-Rule-Definition AVP to
indicate the evaluation precedence of the routing filters contained as within

### 5.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gx reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request in a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gx reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in clause
7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the Gx reference point is the 3GPP Rel-7 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Gx commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Gx reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Gx reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial CCR/CCA command pair:
\- If the PCEF supporting post-Rel-7 Gx functionality is able to interoperate
with a PCRF supporting Rel-7, the CCR shall include the features supported by
the PCEF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the \'M\' bit cleared.
Otherwise, the CCR shall include the supported features within the Supported-
Features AVP(s) with the M-bit set.
NOTE 1: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the CCR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-7 Gx functionality, the CCA command shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both PCEF and PCRF shall behave as
specified in the Rel-7 version of this document.
\- If the CCR command contains the Supported-Features AVP, the PCRF shall
include the Supported-Features AVP in the CCA command, with the \'M\' bit
cleared, indicating only the features that both the PCRF and PCEF support.
NOTE 2: The client will always declare all features that are supported
according to table 5.4.1.1. When more than one feature identifying a release
is supported by both PCEF and PCRF, the PCEF will work according to the latest
common supported release.
Once the PCRF and PCEF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Gx interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.

### 5.4.2 Flow-Description AVP
The Flow-Description AVP (AVP code is defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10]) is of
type IPFilterRule, and defines a packet filter for an IP flow with the
following information:
\- Action shall be keyword permit\"
\- Direction shall be keyword \"out\".
\- Protocol shall be the decimal protocol number or, to indicate that the
value is not used for matching packets, the keyword \"ip\".
\- Source IP address (possibly masked) or, to indicate that the value is not
used for matching packets, the keyword \"any\".
\- Source port is optional and, if present, shall be the decimal port number
or port range.
\- Destination IP address (possibly masked) or, to indicate that the value is
not used for matching packets, the keyword \"assigned\".
\- Destination port is optional and, if present, shall be the decimal port
number or port range.
The IPFilterRule type shall be used with the following restrictions:
\- The parameter encoding shall comply with IETF RFC 3588 [5].
\- No \"options\" shall be used.
\- The invert modifier \"!\" for addresses shall not be used.
The direction \"out\" indicates that the IPFilterRule \"source\" parameters
correspond to the \"remote\" parameters in the packet filter and the
IPFilterRule \"destination\" parameters correspond to the \"local\" (UE end)
parameters. The Flow-Description AVP applies in the direction(s) as specified
in the accompanying Flow-Direction AVP.
## 5.5 Gx specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 5.5.1 General
RFC 3588 [5] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID AVP
and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP Code
298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value representing
the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be set to 3GPP
(10415).
### 5.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE RFC 3588 [5] shall be
applied.
### 5.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE RFC 3588 [5] are
applicable, as an addition the following Result-Code AVP value defined in IETF
RFC 4006 [9] is applicable:
DIAMETER_USER_UNKNOWN (5030)
This error shall be used by the PCRF to indicate to the PCEF that the end user
specified in the request is unknown to the PCRF and that the Gx session cannot
be created.
Also the following specific Gx Experimental-Result-Codes values are defined:
DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140)
This error shall be used when the set of bearer or session or subscriber
information needed by the PCRF for rule selection is incomplete or erroneous
or not available for the decision to be made. (E.g. QoS, SGSN address, RAT
type, TFT, subscriber information)
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRIGGER_EVENT (5141)
This error shall be used when the set of bearer/session information sent in a
CCR originated due to a trigger event been met is incoherent with the previous
set of bearer/session information for the same bearer/session. (E.g. event
trigger met was RAT changed, and the RAT notified is the same as before)
DIAMETER_PCC_RULE_EVENT (5142)
This error shall be used when the PCC rules cannot be installed/activated.
Affected PCC-Rules will be provided in the Charging-Rule-Report AVP including
the reason and status as described in Clause 4.5.12. Absence of the Charging-
Rule-Report means that all provided PCC rules for that specific bearer/session
are affected.
DIAMETER_ERROR_BEARER_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5143)
This error shall be used when the PCRF cannot authorize an IP-CAN bearer (e.g.
the authorized QoS would exceed the subscribed QoS) upon the reception of an
IP-CAN bearer authorization request coming from the PCEF. The affected IP-CAN
bearer is the one that triggered the corresponding CCR. The PCEF shall reject
the attempt to initiate or modify the bearer indicated in the related CCR
command.
DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144)
This error shall be used when the PCRF does not accept one or more of the
traffic mapping filters (e.g. TFT filters for GPRS) provided by the PCEF in a
CC Request.
DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFLICTING_REQUEST (5147)
This error shall be used when the PCRF cannot accept the UE-initiated resource
request as a network-initiated resource allocation is already in progress that
has packet filters that cover the packet filters in the received UE-initiated
resource request. The PCEF shall reject the attempt for UE-initiated resource
request.
DIAMETER_ADC_RULE_EVENT (5148)
This error shall be used when the ADC rules cannot be installed/activated.
Affected ADC Rules shall be provided in the ADC-Rule-Report AVP including the
reason and status as described in Clause 5b.3.6. Absence of the ADC-Rule-
Report means that all provided ADC rules for that IP-CAN session are affected.
### 5.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base RFC 3588 [5] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gx Experimental-Result-Code value is
defined for transient failures:
DIAMETER_PCC_BEARER_EVENT (4141)
This error shall be used when for some reason a PCC rule cannot be enforced or
modified successfully in a network initiated procedure. Affected PCC-Rules
will be provided in the Charging-Rule-Report AVP including the reason and
status as described in Clause 4.5.12.
DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED (4143)
This error shall be used when the policy decisions (i.e.
installation/modification of PCC rules or provisioning of policy decisions not
related to a PCC rule) received within a RAR initiated by the PCRF cannot be
enforced by the PCEF because the AN-Gateway has failed. If one or more PCC
Rules are affected, these PCC Rules will be provided in the Charging-Rule-
Report AVP including the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to AN_GW_FAILED (17), and
PCC-Rule-Status AVP set to INACTIVE as described in Clause 4.5.12. Applicable
only to 3GPP-EPS.
## 5.6 Gx Messages
### 5.6.1 Gx Application
Gx Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in clause
5.1.
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol RFC 3588 [5]
and the Diameter Credit Control Application RFC 4006 [9] are used with the Gx
specific AVPs specified in clause 5.3. The Diameter Credit Control Application
AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that are re-used are defined in
clause 5.4. Due to the definition of these commands there is no possibility to
skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id
AVP instead. Therefore the Gx application identifier shall be included in the
Auth-Application-Id AVP.
In order to support both PULL and PUSH procedures, a diameter session needs to
be established for each IP-CAN session. For IP-CAN types that support multiple
IP-CAN bearers (as in the case of GPRS), the diameter session is established
when the very first IP-CAN bearer for the IP-CAN session is established.
NOTE: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application RFC 4006 [9] or
Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [5].
### 5.6.2 CC-Request (CCR) Command
The CCR command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 and the \'R\'
bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by the PCEF to the PCRF in order
to request PCC rules for a bearer and provision IP flow mobility routing
rules. The CCR command is also sent by the PCEF to the PCRF in order to
indicate bearer, PCC rule or IP flow mobility routing rule related events or
the termination of the IP CAN bearer and/or session.

The CCA command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 and the \'R\'
bit cleared in the Command Flags field, is sent by the PCRF to the PCEF in
response to the CCR command. It is used to provision PCC rules and event
triggers for the bearer/session and to provide the selected bearer control
mode for the IP-CAN session. If the PCRF performs the bearer binding, PCC
rules will be provisioned at bearer level. The primary and secondary CCF

# 5a Gxx protocols
## 5a.1 Protocol support
The Gxx application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application,
where the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the Gxx Application in the
present release is 16777266. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) must be configured appropriately to identify
the 3GPP Gxx application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order to create
suitable routeing tables.
Due to the definition of the commands used in Gxx protocol, there is no
possibility to skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP instead. Therefore the Gxx application identification shall
be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the Gxx interface, the PCRF
acts as a Diameter server, in the sense that it is the network element that
handles QoS Rule requests for a particular realm. The BBERF acts as the
Diameter client, in the sense that it is the network element requesting QoS
rules in the transport plane network resources.
## 5a.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between the BBERF and
PCRF (visited or home) are defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment
and maintenance of connections between Diameter nodes are described in IETF
RFC 3588 [5].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the BBERF shall
advertise the support of the Gxx specific Application by including the value
of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of
the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id
AVP contained in the Capabilities‑Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (RFC 3588 [5]).
The termination of the Diameter session on Gxx can be initiated either by the
BBERF or PCRF, as specified in clauses 4a.5.3 and 4a.5.4, respectively.
## 5a.3 Gxx specific AVPs
Table 5a.3.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Gxx reference point,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the AVP may
be encrypted and what access types (e.g. 3GPP-EPS, etc.) the AVP is applicable
to. The Vendor-Id header of all AVPs defined in the present document shall be
set to 3GPP (10415).

The AVP header bit denoted as 'V', indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID field is present in the AVP header. For further details, see RFC 3588 [5]. NOTE 2: The value types are defined in RFC 3588 [5]. NOTE 3: The Gxx specific AVPs do not apply to 3GPP-GPRS Access Type. NOTE 4: This AVP only applies to case 2b as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] NOTE 5: AVPs marked with "Rel9" are applicable as described in clause 5a.4.1. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5a.3.1 QoS-Rule-Install AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Install AVP (AVP code 1051) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
activate, install or modify QoS rules as instructed from the PCRF to the
BBERF.
For installing a new QoS rule or modifying a QoS rule already installed, QoS-
Rule-Definition AVP shall be used.
For activating a specific QoS rule predefined at the BBERF, QoS-Rule-Name AVP
shall be used as a reference for that QoS rule. The QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is
a reference that may be used for activating a group of QoS rules predefined at
the BBERF.
When Tunnel-Information AVP is provided it applies to all the QoS rules
included within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP. When QoS rules are being modified,
the newly provided Tunnel-Information AVP replaces previously provided Tunnel-
Information AVP for the modified QoS rules. If Resource-Allocation-
Notification AVP is included then it applies to all the rules within the QoS-
Rule-Install AVP. If a QoS-Rule-Install AVP does not include the Resource-
Allocation-Notification AVP, the resource allocation shall not be notified by
the BBERF even if this AVP was present in previous installations of the same
rule.
In case 2a, the QoS-Rule-Install AVP may also contain a charging identifier
within the Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP. The charging
identifier information is used by the BBERF for charging correlation. When the
Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP is included, the identifier
applies to all the QoS rules included within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP. The
charging identifier value for a QoS rule shall be the same as that for the
corresponding PCC rule. When a QoS rule is being modified and no new charging
identifier is provided, then the previously provided charging identifier shall
apply for the modified QoS rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified then it applies
to all the QoS rules within the QoS-Rule-Install AVP.
The 3GPP-GGSN-Address AVP, 3GPP-GGSN-Ipv6-Address AVP, AN-GW-Address AVP and
UDP-Source-Port AVP are only applicable for S9a interface when provided. UDP-
Source-Port AVP provided within QoS-Rule-Install AVP is only applicable for
the trusted S2c case and shall take precedence over the one provided at the
S9a command level.

### 5a.3.2 QoS-Rule-Remove AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Remove AVP (AVP code 1052) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
deactivate or remove QoS rules from an Gateway Control session.
QoS-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific QoS rule at the BBERF to be
removed or for a specific QoS rule predefined at the BBERF to be deactivated.
The QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is a reference for a group of QoS rules predefined
at the BBERF to be deactivated.
Required-Access-Info AVP may be included if the AF requests the PCRF to report
access network information and the PCRF is removing QoS rules based on the AF
requests.
AVP Format:
QoS-Rule-Remove ::= \
*[ QoS-Rule-Name ]
*[ QoS-Rule-Base-Name ]
*[ Required-Access-Info ]
*[ AVP ]
### 5a.3.3 QoS-Rule-Definition AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Definition AVP (AVP code 1053) is of type Grouped, and it defines
the QoS rule for a service data flow sent by the PCRF to the BBERF. The QoS-
Rule-Name AVP uniquely identifies the QoS rule and it is used to reference to
a QoS rule in communication between the BBERF and the PCRF within one Gateway
Control session. The Flow-Information AVP(s) determines the traffic that
belongs to the service data flow.
If optional AVP(s) within a QoS-Rule-Definition AVP are omitted, but
corresponding information has been provided in previous Gxx messages, the
previous information remains valid. If Flow-Information AVP(s) are supplied,
they replace all previous Flow-Information AVP(s).
Required-Access-Info AVP may appear if the AF requests PCRF to report user
access network information.
AVP Format:
QoS-Rule-Definition ::= \
{ QoS-Rule-Name }
*[ Flow-Information ]
[ QoS-Information ]
[ Precedence ]
*[ Required-Access-Info ]
*[ AVP ]
### 5a.3.4 QoS-Rule-Name AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Name AVP (AVP code 1054) is of type OctetString, and it defines a
name for QoS rule. For QoS rules provided by the PCRF it uniquely identifies a
QoS rule within one Gateway Control session. For QoS pre-defined at the BBERF
it uniquely identifies a QoS rule within the BBERF.
### 5a.3.5 QoS-Rule-Report AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Report AVP (AVP code 1055) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
report the status of QoS rules.
QoS-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific QoS rule at the BBERF that has
been successfully installed, modified or removed (for dynamic QoS rules), or
activated or deactivated (for predefined QoS rules). QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is
a reference for a group of QoS rules predefined at the BBERF that has been
successfully activated or deactivated.
The QoS-Rule-Report AVP can also be used to report the status of the QoS rules
which cannot be installed/activated or enforced at the BBERF. In this
condition, the QoS-Rule-Name AVP is used to indicate a specific QoS rule which
cannot be installed/activated or enforced and the QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP is
used to indicate a group of QoS rules which cannot be activated. The Rule-
Failure-Code AVP indicates the reason that the QoS rules cannot be
successfully installed/activated or enforced.
AVP Format:
QoS-Rule-Report ::= \
*[ QoS-Rule-Name ]
*[ QoS-Rule-Base-Name ]
[ PCC-Rule-Status ]
[ Rule-Failure-Code ]
*[ AVP ]
Multiple instances of QoS-Rule-Report AVPs shall be used in the case it is
required to report different PCC-Rule-Status or Rule-Failure-Code values for
different rules within the same Diameter command.
### 5a.3.6 Session-Linking-Indicator AVP (All access types)
The Session-Linking-Indicator AVP (AVP code 1064) is of type Enumerated and
indicates whether the session linking between the Gateway Control Session and
the Gx session must be deferred. The absence of this AVP in case 2b as defined
in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8] shall indicate the value SESSION_LINKING_IMMEDIATE.
The following values are defined:
SESSION_LINKING_IMMEDIATE (0)
This value shall be used to indicate that the PCRF shall perform the linking
between the new Gateway Control Session with an existing Gx session
immediately.
SESSION_LINKING_DEFERRED (1)
This value shall be used to indicate that the PCRF shall not attempt linking
the new Gateway Control Session with an existing Gx session immediately.
### 5a.3.7 QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP (All access types)
The QoS-Rule-Base-Name AVP (AVP code 1074) is of type UTF8String, and it
indicates the name of a pre‑defined group of QoS rules residing at the BBERF.
## 5a.4 Gxx re-used AVPs
Table 5a.4.1 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the Gxx reference point from
Gx reference point and other existing Diameter Applications, reference to
their respective specifications, short description of their usage within the
Gxx reference point, the applicability of the AVPs to a specific access, and
which supported features the AVP is applicable to. When reused from Gx
reference point, the specific clause in the present specification is referred.
Other AVPs from existing Diameter Applications, except for the AVPs from
Diameter base protocol, do not need to be supported. The AVPs from Diameter
base protocol are not included in table 5a.4, but they are re-used for the Gxx
reference point. Unless otherwise stated, re-used AVPs shall maintain their
\'M\', \'P\' and \'V\' flag settings. Where RADIUS VSAs are re-used, unless
otherwise stated, they shall be translated to Diameter AVPs as described in
RFC 4005 [12] with the exception that the \'M\' flag shall be set and the
\'P\' flag may be set.

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
### 5a.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gxx reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request of a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Gxx reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
on the Cx reference point as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the Gxx reference point is the 3GPP Rel-8 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Gxx commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Gxx reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Gxx reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial CCR/CCA command pair:
\- If the BBERF supports post-Rel-8 Gxx functionality, the CCR shall include
the features supported by the BBERF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the
\'M\' bit cleared.
NOTE: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the CCR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-8 Gxx functionality, the PCRF shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP in the CCA command. In this case, both BBERF and PCRF
shall behave as specified in the Rel-8 version of this document.
NOTE: The client will always declare all features that are supported according
to table 5a.4.1.1. When more than one feature identifying a release is
supported by both BBERF and PCRF, the BBERF will work according to the latest
common supported release.
Once the PCRF and BBERF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Gxx interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.
Table 5a.4.1.1: Features of Feature-List-ID 1 used in Gxx
+-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | Feature bit | Feature | M/O | Description | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | 0 | Rel9 | M | This feature | | | | | indicates the | | | | | support of base | | | | | 3GPP Rel-9 Gxx | | | | | functionality, | | | | | including the | | | | | AVPs and | | | | | corresponding | | | | | procedures | | | | | supported by the | | | | | base 3GPP Rel-8 | | | | | Gxx standard, but | | | | | excluding those | | | | | features | | | | | represented by | | | | | separate feature | | | | | bits. AVPs | | | | | introduced with | | | | | this feature are | | | | | marked with | | | | | \"Rel9\" in Table | | | | | 5a.3.1 and Table | | | | | 5a.4.1. | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | 1 | vSRVCC | O | This feature | | | | | indicates support | | | | | for the vSRVCC | | | | | feature (see | | | | | 3GPP T | | | | | S 23.216 [40]). | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | 2 | EPC-routed | O | This feature | | | | | indicates support | | | | | for interworking | | | | | with Fixed Broad | | | | | band Access | | | | | networks when the | | | | | traffic is routed | | | | | via the EPC | | | | | network as | | | | | defined in Annex | | | | | E. | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | 3 | NetLoc | O | This feature | | | | | indicates the | | | | | support of the | | | | | Access Network | | | | | Information | | | | | Reporting. If the | | | | | BBERF supports | | | | | this feature, the | | | | | PCRF shall behave | | | | | as described in | | | | | clause 4a.5.16 | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | 4 | ExtendedFilter | O | This feature | | | | | indicates the | | | | | support for the | | | | | local UE address | | | | | being present in | | | | | filters signalled | | | | | between network | | | | | and UE. | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | 6 | void | | | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+ | Feature bit: The | | | | | order number of | | | | | the bit within | | | | | the Feature-List | | | | | AVP where the | | | | | least significant | | | | | bit is assigned | | | | | number \"0\". | | | | | | | | | | Feature: A short | | | | | name that can be | | | | | used to refer to | | | | | the bit and to | | | | | the feature, e.g. | | | | | \"EPS\". | | | | | | | | | | M/O: Defines if | | | | | the | | | | | implementation of | | | | | the feature is | | | | | mandatory (\"M\") | | | | | or optional | | | | | (\"O\") in this | | | | | 3GPP Release. | | | | | | | | | | Description: A | | | | | clear textual | | | | | description of | | | | | the feature. | | | | +-------------------+----------------+-----+-------------------+
## 5a.5 Gxx specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
The same codes specified in clause 5.5 apply here with the following
exceptions:
The following permanent Experimental-Result-Code shall be used instead of
DIAMETER_PCC_RULE_EVENT (5142):
DIAMETER_QOS_RULE_EVENT (5145)
This error shall be used when the QoS rules cannot be installed/activated.
Affected QoS-Rules will be provided in the QoS-Rule-Report AVP including the
reason and status as described in Clause 4a.5.5.
The following transient Experimental-Result-Code shall be used instead of
DIAMETER_PCC_BEARER_EVENT (4141):
DIAMETER_BEARER_EVENT (4142)
This error shall be used when for some reason a QoS rule cannot be enforced or
modified successfully in a network initiated procedure. Affected QoS Rules
will be provided in the QoS-Rule-Report AVP including the reason and status as
described in Clause 4a.5.5.
## 5a.6 Gxx Messages
### 5a.6.1 Gxx Application
Gxx Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in
clause 5a.1.
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol RFC 3588 [5]
and the Diameter Credit Control Application RFC 4006 [9] are used with the Gxx
specific AVPs specified in clause 5a.3. The Diameter Credit Control
Application AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that are re-used
are defined in clause 5a.4. Due to the definition of these commands there is
no possibility to skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use the Vendor-
Specific-Application-Id AVP instead. Therefore the Gxx application identifier
shall be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP. A diameter session needs to
be established for each Gateway Control session.
NOTE: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application RFC 4006 [9] or
Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [5].
### 5a.6.2 CC-Request (CCR) Command
The CCR command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 and the \'R\'
bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by the BBERF to the PCRF in order
to request QoS rules. The CCR command is also sent by the BBERF to the PCRF in
order to indicate QoS rule related events or the termination of the Gateway
Control session.

# 5b Sd protocol
## 5b.1 Protocol support
The Sd application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application, where
the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415. The
Application-ID for the Sd Application is 16777303 and this value shall be used
in the Diameter command header as well as any Application-ID AVPs (Auth-
Application-Id/Vendor-Specific-Application-Id) in the command body.
## 5b.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each PCRF and TDF
pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance of
connections between Diameter nodes is described in RFC 3588 [5].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the TDF shall
advertise the support of the Sd specific Application by including the value of
the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilities‑Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (RFC 3588 [5]).
The Diameter session on Sd is established either at the request of the PCRF in
case of solicited application reporting or at the request of the TDF in case
of unsolicited application reporting. Session modifications may be initiated
by either TDF or PCRF. Session termination is initiated at the request of the
PCRF as specified in clause 4b.5.4.
## 5b.3 Sd specific AVPs
Table 5b.3.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Sd reference point,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the AVP may
be encrypted, what access types (e.g. 3GPP-GPRS, etc.) the AVP is applicable
to, the applicability of the AVPs to charging control, policy control or both,
and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. The Vendor-Id header of
all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to 3GPP (10415).

The AVP header bit denoted as 'V', indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID field is present in the AVP header. For further details, see RFC 3588 [5]. NOTE 2: The value types are defined in RFC 3588 [5]. NOTE 3: AVPs marked with "ADC" are applicable to application detection and control. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5b.3.1 ADC-Rule-Install AVP
The ADC-Rule-Install AVP (AVP code 1092) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
activate, install or modify ADC rules as instructed from the PCRF.
For installing a new ADC rule or modifying an ADC rule already installed, ADC-
Rule-Definition AVP shall be used.
For activating a specific predefined ADC rule, ADC-Rule-Name AVP shall be used
as a reference for that ADC rule. The ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP is a reference
that may be used for activating a group of predefined ADC rules.
If Rule-Activation-Time or Rule-Deactivation-Time is specified then it applies
to all the ADC rules within the ADC-Rule-Install.

### 5b.3.2 ADC-Rule-Remove AVP
The ADC-Rule-Remove AVP (AVP code 1093) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
deactivate or remove ADC rules as instructed from the PCRF.
ADC-Rule-Name AVP is a reference for a specific dynamic ADC rule to be removed
or for a specific predefined ADC rule to be deactivated. The ADC-Rule-Base-
Name AVP is a reference for a group of predefined ADC rules to be deactivated.
AVP Format:

### 5b.3.3 ADC-Rule-Definition AVP
The ADC-Rule-Definition AVP (AVP code 1094) is of type Grouped, and it defines
the ADC rule sent by the PCRF. The ADC-Rule-Name AVP uniquely identifies the
ADC rule and it is used to reference to an ADC rule in communication between
the PCRF and the TDF within one TDF session. The TDF Application Identifier
AVP(s) determines the traffic that belongs to the application.
If optional AVP(s) within an ADC-Rule-Definition AVP are omitted, but
corresponding information has been provided in previous Sd messages, the
previous information remains valid.
Monitoring-Key AVP contains the monitoring key that may apply to the ADC rule.
Mute-Notification status shall not be changed during the lifetime of the ADC
rules.
AVP Format:
ADC-Rule-Definition ::= \
{ ADC-Rule-Name }
[ TDF-Application-Identifier ]
[ Flow-Status ]
[ QoS-Information ]
[ Monitoring-Key ]
[ Redirect-Information ]
[ Mute-Notification ]
*[ AVP ]
### 5b.3.4 ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP
The ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP (AVP code 1095) is of type UTF8String, and it
indicates the name of a predefined group of ADC rules.
### 5b.3.5 ADC-Rule-Name AVP
The ADC-Rule-Name AVP (AVP code 1096) is of type OctetString, and it defines a
name for ADC rule. For ADC rules provided by the PCRF it uniquely identifies
an ADC rule within one TDF session. For predefined ADC rules, it uniquely
identifies an ADC rule within the TDF.
### 5b.3.6 ADC-Rule-Report AVP
The ADC-Rule-Report AVP (AVP code 1097) is of type Grouped, and it is used to
report the status of ADC rules.
The ADC-Rule-Report AVP is used to report the status of the ADC rules which
cannot be installed/activated or enforced at the TDF. In this condition, the
ADC-Rule-Name AVP is used to indicate a specific ADC rule which cannot be
installed/activated or enforced, and the ADC-Rule-Base-Name AVP is used to
indicate a group of ADC rules which cannot be activated. The PCC-Rule-Status
AVP is set to INACTIVE. The Rule-Failure-Code indicates the reason that the
ADC rules cannot be successfully installed/activated or enforced.
AVP Format:
ADC-Rule-Report ::= \
*[ ADC-Rule-Name ]
*[ ADC-Rule-Base-Name ]
[ PCC-Rule-Status ]
[ Rule-Failure-Code ]
*[ AVP ]
Multiple instances of ADC-Rule-Report AVPs shall be used in the case it is
required to report different PCC-Rule-Status or Rule-Failure-Code values for
different groups of rules within the same Diameter command.
## 5b.4 Sd re-used AVPs
Table 5b.4 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the Sd reference point from
existing Diameter Applications, reference to their respective specifications,
short description of their usage within the Sd reference pointand which
supported features the AVP is applicable to. Other AVPs from existing Diameter
Applications, except for the AVPs from Diameter base protocol, do not need to
be supported. The AVPs from Diameter base protocol are not included in table
5b.4, but they are re-used for the Sd reference point. Unless otherwise
stated, re-used AVPs shall maintain their \'M\', \'P\' and \'V\' flag
settings. Where 3GPP Radius VSAs are re-used, unless otherwise stated, they
shall be translated to Diameter AVPs as described in IETF RFC 4005 [12] with
the exception that the \'M\' flag shall be set and the \'P\' flag may be set.

### 5b.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Sd reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The Diameter node sending a Diameter request that establishes a
Diameter session (i.e. the PCRF for solicited application reporting and the
TDF for unsolicited application reporting) shall, in this request, indicate
the set of features it supports. The Diameter node answering this request
(i.e. the TDF for solicited application reporting and the PCRF for unsolicited
application reporting) shall indicate the set of features that it has in
common with the features in the request and that it shall support within the
same Diameter session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant
with the list of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs
during session establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported
shall not be used to construct the command messages for that Diameter session.
Unless otherwise stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Sd
reference point shall be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery
of supported features and associated error handling on the Sd reference point
as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the Sd reference point is the 3GPP Rel-11 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Sd commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Sd reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Sd reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial TSR/TSA command pair:
\- If the TDF supports post-Rel-11 Sd functionality, the TSA shall include the
features supported by the TDF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the \'M\'
bit cleared.
NOTE: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the TSR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s), the TSA
command shall not include the Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both TDF
and PCRF shall behave as specified in the Rel-11 version of this document
without UMCH feature.
Once the PCRF and TDF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Sd interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.
Table 5b.4.1.1: Features of Feature-List-ID 1 used in Sd
+----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | Feature bit | Feature | M/O | Description | +----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | 0 | UMCH | O | This feature | | | | | indicates support | | | | | for Usage Monitoring | | | | | Congestion Handling. | | | | | If the TDF supports | | | | | this feature, the | | | | | benaviour shall be | | | | | as specified in | | | | | clauses 4b.5.7.7. | +----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | 1 | Trusted-WLAN | O | This feature | | | | | indicates the | | | | | support for the | | | | | Trusted WLAN access | | | | | as defined in | | | | | 3G | | | | | PP TS 23.402 [23]. | +----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | Feature bit:The | | | | | order number of the | | | | | bit within the | | | | | Feature-List AVP | | | | | where the least | | | | | significant bit is | | | | | assigned number | | | | | \"0\". | | | | | | | | | | Feature: A short | | | | | name that can be | | | | | used to refer to the | | | | | bit and to the | | | | | feature, e.g. | | | | | \"EPS\". | | | | | | | | | | M/O: Defines if the | | | | | implementation of | | | | | the feature is | | | | | mandatory (\"M\") or | | | | | optional (\"O\") in | | | | | this 3GPP Release. | | | | | | | | | | Description: A clear | | | | | textual description | | | | | of the feature. | | | | +----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+
## 5b.5 Sd specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### 5b.5.1 General
RFC 3588 [5] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID AVP
and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP Code
298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value representing
the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be set to 3GPP
(10415).
### 5b.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE RFC 3588 [5] shall be
applied.
### 5b.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter BASE RFC 3588 [5] are
applicable. Also the following specific Gx Experimental-Result-Codes value is
reused for TDF session: DIAMETER_ADC_RULE_EVENT (see 5.5.3):
### 5b.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base RFC 3588 [5] are
applicable.
## 5b.6 Sd Messages
### 5b.6.1 Sd Application
Sd Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in clause
5b.1.
In addition to the TDF-Session-Request/Answer commands used to establish the
TDF session, existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol
RFC 3588 [5] and the Diameter Credit Control Application RFC 4006 [9] are used
with the Sd specific AVPs specified in clause 5b.3. The Diameter Credit
Control Application AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that are
re-used are defined in clause 5b.4. Due to the definition of these reused
commands there is no possibility to skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use
the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP instead. Therefore the Sd application
identifier shall be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP for the reused
commands. The Sd application identifier shall be included in the Auth-
Application-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id grouped AVP
contained in the TDF-Session-Request/Answer commands.
In order to support both PULL and PUSH procedures, a Diameter session needs to
be established for each TDF session, if there is a decision made by PCRF to
establish TDF session.
NOTE: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application RFC 4006 [9] or
Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [5].

###### ## Annex A (normative): Access specific aspects (GPRS)
# A.1 Scope
This annex defines access specific aspects procedures for use of Gx/Gxx
between PCRF and a GPRS IP-CAN.
# A.2 Reference Model
In GPRS IP-CAN, the BBERF does not apply. The Gxx reference point is not
applicable.
# A.2 Functional Elements
## A.2.1 PCRF
For GPRS it shall be possible to support policy control, i.e. access control
and QoS control, on a per-PDP context basis for the UE initiated bearer
control case.
# A.3 PCC procedures
## A.3.1 Request for PCC rules
At IP-CAN session establishment as described in clause 4.5.1, information
about the user equipment (e.g. IMEISV), QoS negotiated and further QoS related
information as detailed in Clause A.3.3.1, user location information (e.g.
RAI, CGI/SAI) SGSN Address, SGSN country and network codes, APN and indication
if the bearer is used as IMS signalling PDP context shall be provided. The
PCEF shall provide the Bearer-Identifier AVP at the IP-CAN session
establishment. In this case, the PCEF shall also include the Bearer-Operation
AVP set to the value \"Establishment\". If information about the support of
network-initiated bearer procedures is available, the Network-Request-Support
AVP shall be provided.
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 29.060 [18] defines the RAT type as optional over Gn/Gp
interface up to 3GPP Rel‑9. In fact the optionality was introduced solely for
maintaining backwards compatibility at the protocol level between different
versions of the protocol. For 3GPP Rel-9 and and earlier releases, the
conditions about when the RAT-Type is present over Gn/Gp interface are defined
in 3GPP TS 23.060 [17] clause 15.1.1a. From 3GPP Rel-10 onwards, it is
mandatory for the RAT Type IE to be sent by the SGSN to the GGSN at Create PDP
Context, or at Update PDP Context when the RAT has changed.
IP-CAN session modification with PCEF-requested rules, as described in clause
4.5.1, can occur in the following cases:
\- When a new PDP Context is being established by the UE in an already
existing IP-CAN Session.
\- When a PDP context is being modified and an Event trigger is met.
\- When a PDP context is being terminated.
The request for PCC rules is formed in the same way, regardless the bearer
control mode. The IP-CAN session may have no resources initiated by the
network, e.g. for an IP-CAN session that operates in BCM UE_ONLY, and in that
case there are no NW-initiated resources to take into account.
The following replaces, for packet filter information and QoS handling, what
is specified in clause 4.5.1:
\- If a new IP-CAN bearer is being established, the PCEF shall assign a new
bearer identifier to this IP-CAN bearer, include this identifier within the
Bearer-Identifier AVP, and include the Bearer-Operation AVP set to the value
\"ESTABLISHMENT\", the UE-provided TFT filters and the requested QoS of the
new IP-CAN bearer.
\- If an existing IP-CAN bearer is being modified:
\- If the PCEF has not yet notified the PCRF about this IP CAN bearer and the
UE adds one or more packet filters to the Traffic Flow template, the PCEF
shall assign a new bearer identifier to this IP-CAN bearer, include the
Bearer-Identifier AVP, the Bearer-Operation AVP set to the value
\"ESTABLISHMENT\", the UE-provided TFT filters and the requested QoS as
detailed in Clause A.3.3.3a.
\- If the PCEF has already notified the PCRF about this IP CAN bearer, the
PCEF shall include the Bearer-Identifier AVP, the Bearer-Operation AVP set to
the value \"MODIFICATION\" all the TFT filter definitions for this bearer,
including the requested changes but excluding the TFT filters created with NW-
initiated procedures, and QoS related information as detailed in Clause
A.3.3.3a.
\- If an existing IP-CAN bearer is being terminated, the PCEF shall include
the Bearer-Identifier AVP, the Bearer-Operation AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION\" and the Charging-Rule-Report AVP indicating the removal of any
PCC rules created with NW-initiated procedures having the bearer binding with
the same bearer.
\- If the Event trigger that caused the IP-CAN bearer modification applies at
session level (i.e. it is common to all the bearers belonging to that IP-CAN
session), PCEF shall send a single CC-Request for all the affected bearers. In
this case, the Bearer-Identifier AVP shall not be included to indicate that it
applies to all the IP-CAN bearers in the IP-CAN session. If the Event trigger
that caused the IP CAN bearer modification applies at bearer level, the
Charging-Rule-Report AVP shall include all the affected PCC rules.
If the PCRF does not accept one or more of the TFT filters provided by the
PCEF in a CC Request (e.g. because the PCRF does not allow the UE to request
enhanced QoS for services not known to the PCRF), the PCRF shall reject the
request using a CC Answer with the Gx experimental result code
TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED (5144). If the PCEF receives a CC Answer with
this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session establishment or
modification that initiated the CC Request by applying a proper cause code and
other parameters as per 3GPP TS 29.060 [18].
## A.3.2 Provisioning of PCC rules
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding and installs or activates a new PCC
rule, the PCRF shall indicate the IP CAN bearer where the new rule shall be
installed or activated using a Bearer-Identifier AVP within the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP. If the PCRF modifies an already installed PCC rule, the PCRF does
not need to indicate the bearer. If the PCEF obtains an updated definition of
a PCC rule within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP without a Bearer-Identifier AVP,
the PCEF shall continue to apply the PCC rule to the IP CAN bearer that has
previously been indicated.
If the PCRF does not perform the bearer binding and installs or activates a
new PCC rule, the PCRF does not indicate the bearer within the Charging-Rule-
Install AVP. The PCEF shall then perform the bearer binding and select the IP
CAN bearer where the provisioned new PCC rule is applied.
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF may move previously
installed or activated PCC rule(s) from one IP CAN bearer to another IP CAN
bearer. To move such PCC rule(s), the PCRF shall indicate the new bearer using
the Bearer-Identifier AVP within a Charging-Rule-Install AVP and shall
indicate the charging rules(s) to be moved using Charging-Rule name AVP(s),
and/or a Charging-Rule-Base-Name AVP(s), and/or Charging-Rule-Definition
AVP(s) (for PCC rule(s) that are modified at the same time). The PCEF shall
then apply these PCC rules at the new indicated IP CAN bearer and shall remove
them from the IP CAN bearer where the rules previously had been applied.
The PCRF may request the establishment of a bearer dedicated to IMS signalling
by providing the applicable PCC rules to the PCEF.
When the PCEF includes the Bearer-Usage AVP required for the bearer within the
CCR command during the IP-CAN session establishment procedure, the PCRF shall
provide the Bearer-Usage AVP back in the response with the authorized usage.
If the PCEF includes IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP and the PCRF
accepts that default bearer is dedicated to IMS signalling, the PCRF shall
include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP. In this case, the PCRF
shall restrict the bearer to only be used for IMS signalling as specified in
3GPP TS 23.228 [31] by applying the applicable QCI for IMS signalling.
If the PCEF include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP in the CCR
command, but the PCRF does not include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-
Usage AVP in the CCA command, the PCC Rules provided by the PCRF shall have a
QCI value different from the QCI value for the IMS signalling.
When the PCRF performs the bearer binding and the UE initiates a Secondary PDP
Context Activation, if the PCEF includes the Bearer-Usage AVP indicating
IMS_SIGNALLING and the PCRF accepts that a bearer dedicated to IMS signalling
shall be used, the PCRF shall return the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-
Usage AVP. The provided PCC rules shall have the QCI applicable for IMS
signalling.
### A.3.2.1 PCC rule request for services not known to PCRF
When the PCRF receives a request for PCC rules while no suitable authorized
PCC rules are configured in the PCRF, and if the user is not allowed to access
AF session based services but is allowed to request resources for services not
known to the PCRF, refer to clause 4.5.2.0, the PCRF may downgrade the bitrate
parameters and the QCI according to PCC internal policies when authorizing the
request.
### A.3.2.2 Selecting a PCC rule and IP CAN Bearer for Downlink IP packets
TFT filters shall not be applied to assign downlink IP packets to PDP contexts
if PCC is enabled for an APN.
## A.3.3 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
For 3GPP-GPRS, default EPS bearer QoS provisioning and enforcement is not
applicable.
### A.3.3.0 Overview
The PCRF may provide the authorized QoS that applies to a bearer to the PCEF.
When the authorized QoS applies to an IP CAN bearer, it shall be provisioned
outside a Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and it shall also include the Bearer-
Identifier AVP to indicate what bearer it applies to.
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
presents the QoS for this IP CAN bearer. Authorized QoS per QCI is not
applicable. If the PCEF performs the bearer binding, the authorized QoS per IP
CAN bearer is not applicable.
The Provisioning of authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer may be performed separate
or in combination with the PCC rule provisioning procedure in clause 4.5.2.0.
In case the PCRF provides PCC rules dynamically, authorised QoS information
for the IP-CAN bearer (combined QoS) may be provided. For a predefined PCC
rule within the PCEF the authorized QoS information shall take affect when the
PCC rule is activated.
The PCEF shall make sure that the total QoS information of the PCC rules for
one IP-CAN bearer does not exceed the authorized QoS information, i.e. the
information received from the PCRF.
### A.3.3.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer is used if the bearer binding is
performed by the PCRF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8]).
The PCEF will request the authorization of an IP CAN bearer establishment or
modification by the PCRF using the \"Request for PCC rules\" procedure if the
related conditions outlined in clause 4.5.1 apply. While executing this
procedure, the PCEF shall apply the following QoS related procedures:
\- When the UE request the establishment of a new IP-CAN bearer, the PCEF
shall derive the requested QoS information. The PCEF shall use Table A.4.1.1
to map the requested QoS within the IP CAN bearer establishment request to the
QoS-Information AVP. If the PCEF receives the \"upgrade QoS Supported\" flag
set to \"1\" in the Common Flag Information element within the corresponding
Create PDP context request (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), the PCEF shall supply the
QoS-Upgrade AVP with value QoS_UPGRADE_SUPPORTED. The PCEF shall request a new
PCC decisions using a CCR command including the requested QoS information
within the QoS-Information AVP, in the CCR command to be sent to the PCRF.
The PCEF shall then wait for the corresponding CCA before replying to the IP-
CAN bearer establishment request.
\- If at any point of time the PCEF receives a request for a modification of
an already existing IP-CAN bearer that matches event triggers supplied by the
PCRF for the IP CAN session, the PCEF shall also request a new PCC decisions
using a CCR command including the corresponding event triggers in the Event-
Trigger AVP. If a QoS change for the existing IP-CAN bearer is requested the
PCEF shall include the requested QoS information within the QoS-Information
AVP in the CCR. If the PCEF receives within the corresponding Update PDP
context request the \"upgrade QoS Supported\" flag in the Common Flag
Information element (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]) set to a different value than
previously communicated to the PCRF, the PCEF shall supply the QoS-Upgrade AVP
indicating the new value. If the PCEF receives within the Update PDP context
request the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag set to \"1\" in the Common Flag
Information element (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), the PCEF shall supply the QoS-
Negotiation AVP with the value NO_QoS_NEGOTIATION.\ \ The PCEF shall wait for
the corresponding CCA before replying to the IP-CAN bearer modification
request.
When receiving a CCR with a QoS-Information AVP, the PCRF shall decide upon
the requested QoS information within the CCR command.
\- The PCRF may compare the authorized QoS derived according to clause 6.3 of
3GPP TS 29.213 [8] with the requested QoS. If the requested QoS is less than
the authorised QoS, the PCRF may either request to upgrade the IP CAN QoS by
supplying that authorised QoS in the QoS-Information AVP to the PCEF (e.g. if
the PCRF has exact knowledge of the required QoS for the corresponding
service), or the PCRF may only authorise the requested QoS by supplying the
requested QoS in the QoS-Information AVP to the PCEF (e.g. if the PCRF only
derives upper limits for the authorized QoS for the corresponding service). If
the requested bitrates are higher than the authorised bitrates, the PCRF shall
downgrade the IP CAN QoS by supplying the authorised QoS in the QoS-
Information AVP to the PCEF.
The following restrictions apply to the PCRF QoS authorization process:
\- If the QoS-Negotiation AVP is received by the PCRF indicating that QoS
negotiation is not allowed, the PCRF shall provision the requested QoS as
authorized QoS.
\- If the QoS-Upgrade AVP has been received by the PCRF indicating that QoS
upgrade is not supported, the PCRF shall not provision an authorized bitrates
(e.g. GBR, MBR) that are higher than the requested bitrates.
If for any reason the PCRF cannot authorize the requested QoS (e.g. authorized
QoS would exceed the subscribed QoS), the PCRF shall indicate to the PCEF that
the request is rejected by answering with a CCA command including the
Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
DIAMETER_ERROR_BEARER_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5143) together with the bearer-
identifier AVP. Otherwise, the PCRF shall provide a response for the CCR to
the PCEF by issuing a CCA command without this experimental result code. The
PCRF may use this CCA at the same time for the solicited PCC rule provisioning
procedure in clause 4.5.2. The CCA command shall include a QoS-Information AVP
at command level including the Bearer-Identifier AVP used in the corresponding
CCR and the authorized QCI and bitrates. If PCRF decides to move rules between
bearers, the CCA command shall also include the QoS-Information AVP(s) for the
impacted bearers.
The PCRF may also decide to modify the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer if it
receives a CCR with other event triggers, for instance if the PCRF moves PCC
rules from one IP-CAN bearer to another (e.g. in GPRS due to a TFT change).
The PCRF shall then provision the updated authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer in
the CCA within a QoS-Information AVP at command level including the
corresponding Bearer-Identifier AVP.
The PCRF may decide to modify the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer at any
time. To modify the authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer, The PCRF shall send an
unsolicited authorization to the PCEF. The unsolicited authorization shall be
performed by sending a RAR command to the PCEF and including the QoS-
Information AVP(s) with the new authorized values per IP CAN bearer. The PCRF
may use this RAR at the same time for the unsolicited PCC rule provisioning
procedure in clause 4.5.2.0. If the trigger to modify the authorized QoS comes
from the AF, before starting an unsolicited provisioning, the PCRF may start a
timer to wait for a UE requested corresponding PDP context modification. At
the expiry of the timer, if no PCC rule request has previously been received
by the PCRF, the PCRF should go on with the unsolicited authorization as
explained above.
In addition to a provisioning of the \"Authorized QoS\" per IP CAN Bearer, the
PCRF may also provide an authorized QoS per PCC rule.
### A.3.3.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per IP CAN bearer
The PCEF is responsible for enforcing the policy based authorization, i.e., to
ensure that the requested QoS is in-line with the \"Authorized QoS\" per IP-
CAN bearer, as described in Clause 4.5.5.1.
Upon reception of an authorized QoS per IP-CAN bearer within a CCA or RAR
command, the PCEF shall perform the mapping from that \"Authorised QoS\"
information for the IP-CAN bearer into authorised UM3GPP TS QoS information
according to Table A.4.1.1. The authorised UM3GPP TS QoS information is
further processed by the UM3GPP TS BS Manager within the GGSN.
If the PCEF receives a solicited authorization decision from the PCRF (i.e. a
decision within a CCA) and the requested QoS received within the IP-CAN bearer
establishment or modification request that triggered the corresponding request
for the authorization decision does not match the authorised QoS, the PCEF
shall adjust the requested QoS information to the authorised QoS information
within the IP-CAN bearer establishment or modification response.
The PCEF may store the authorized QoS of an active IP-CAN bearer in order to
be able to make local decisions, when the UE requests for an IP-CAN bearer
modification.
When the PCEF receives an unsolicited authorisation decision from the PCRF
(i.e. a decision within a RAR) with updated QoS information for an IP-CAN
bearer, the PCEF shall update the stored authorised QoS. If the existing QoS
of the IP-CAN bearer does not match the updated authorised QoS the PCEF shall
perform a network initiated IP-CAN bearer modification to adjust the QoS to
the authorised level.
If the PCEF provide authorized QoS for both, the IP-CAN bearer and PCC
rule(s), the enforcement of authorized QoS of the individual PCC rules shall
take place first.
### A.3.3.2a Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding for a service data flow, the PCRF may
optionally provision an authorized QoS for that service data flow.
For the authorization of a PCC rule with a GBR QCI the PCRF shall assign a GBR
value within the limit supported by the serving network (i.e. GERAN/UTRAN).
The PCRF shall subscribe the RAT_CHANGE event to get the RAT type information
for PCC rule authorization.
NOTE: For the authorization of PCC Rules with the same QCI the PCRF may also
check that aggregated GBR is within the limits supported by the serving
network to minimize the risk of rejection of the bearer by the serving
network.
### A.3.3.3 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per service data flow
If the PCRF provides authorized QoS for both, the IP-CAN bearer and PCC
rule(s), the enforcement of authorized QoS of the individual PCC rules shall
take place first.
The mapping from the authorized QoS parameters to the UM3GPP TS QoS parameters
shall be performed according to Table A.4.1.1.
### A.3.3.3a Coordination of authorized QoS scopes in mixed mode
The PCEF will request the authorization of an IP CAN bearer establishment or
modification by the PCRF using the \"Request for PCC rules\" procedure if the
related conditions outlined in Clause 4.5.1 and A.3.1 apply. The PCEF shall
exclude any guaranteed bitrate for the NW-created PCC rule(s) it has bound to
that IP CAN bearer from the requested QoS of that IP CAN bearer and request
the authorization of the QoS for the affected PCC rules and, if any, new
filters from the PCRF within the within the QoS-Information AVP.
The PCRF shall authorize the bandwidth for an IP CAN bearer which is required
for the PCC rules it has bound to this IP CAN bearer. The PCEF shall add to
the PCRF-provisioned authorized bandwidth of an IP CAN bearer the required
bandwidth of all PCC rules it has bound to that IP CAN bearer unless the
derived MBR value exceeds a possibly provisioned authorized QoS per QCI for
the bearerer´s QCI (see Clause 4.5.5.6).
### A.3.3.3b Provisioning of authorized QoS per QCI
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding the PCRF shall not provision an
authorized QoS per QCI.
Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per QCI may apply when the IP-CAN type
is 3GPP-GPRS. It shall be performed according to clause 4.5.5.5.
### A.3.3.4 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per QCI
Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per QCI may apply when the IP-CAN type
is 3GPP-GPRS. It shall be performed according to clause 4.5.5.6.
The mapping from the authorized QoS parameters to the UM3GPP TS QoS parameters
shall be performed according to Table A.4.1.1.
### A.3.3.5 Void
### A.3.3.6 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
If the PCRF receives the requested QoS per APN as part of the IP-CAN session
establishment procedure, the PCRF shall provision the authorized QoS per APN
in the response.
## A.3.4 Indication of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications
When a PDP context is terminated, the PCEF shall apply the \"Indication of IP
CAN Bearer Termination Implications\" procedure to inform the PCRF about
implications of this bearer termination if any of the following conditions
apply while the IP-CAN Session remains active:
\- A PDP Context is terminated, which has been initiated by the UE.
\- A PDP Context is terminated, which has been initiated by the network (e.g.
SGSN).
The following exceptions to clause 4.5.6 shall apply in 3GPP-GPRS.
When the PCRF performs bearer binding, the PCEF shall also supply the Bearer-
Identifier and Bearer-Operation AVPs to indicate \"Termination\" of a specific
bearer in a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"UPDATE_REQUEST\".
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request indicating the implications of a bearer
termination, it shall acknowledge the message by sending a CC-Answer to the
PCEF. The PCRF has the option to make a new PCC decision for the affected PCC
Rules. Within the CC-answer, the PCRF may provision PCC rules as detailed in
clause 4.5.2.0. When the PCRF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF may
provision PCC rules e.g. to move PCC rules previously applied to the
terminated IP CAN bearer to any of the remaining IP CAN bearer(s). The Bearer-
Identifier of the selected bearer(s) will be provided. The PCEF shall remove
all PCC rules previously applied to the terminated IP CAN bearer, which have
not been moved.
The PCEF shall remove all PCC rules previously applied to the terminated IP
CAN bearer, which have not been moved.
If the last PDP context within an IP CAN session is being terminated, the PCEF
shall apply the procedures in clause A.3.5 to indicate the IP CAN session
termination
## A.3.5 Indication of IP-CAN Session Termination
For GPRS, an IP-CAN session is terminated when the last PDP Context within the
IP-CAN session is being terminated. The procedure described in clause 4.5.7
applies here.
## A.3.6 Request of IP-CAN Bearer Termination
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN bearer, the PCEF shall send a
PDP context deactivation request.
If the termination of the last IP CAN bearer within an IP CAN session is
requested, the PCRF and PCEF shall apply the procedures in clause A.3.7.
If the selected Bearer Control Mode is UE-only, the PCRF may request the
termination of an existing IP CAN bearer within an IP CAN session by using the
PCC rule provisioning procedures in clause 4.5.2.0 to remove all PCRF-
provisioned PCC rules and deactivate all PCC rules predefined within the PCEF,
which have been applied to this IP CAN bearer. The PCRF may either completely
remove these PCC rules from the IP CAN session or move them to another IP CAN
bearer within the IP CAN session.
If the PCEF performs the IP CAN bearer binding, the PCRF is not aware that it
requests the termination of an IP CAN bearer by removing certain PCC rules. If
upon removal of the PCC rules, there are no more PCC rules active in the PCEF
for an IP-CAN bearer, the PCEF shall initiate the bearer termination
procedure. Further details of the binding mechanism can be found in 3GPP TS
29.213 [8].
If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-only, and the PCRF receives a
trigger for the removal of all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN bearer from the
AF, the following steps apply. In order to avoid race conditions, the PCRF
should start a timer to wait for the UE-initiated termination message. If a
UE-initiated termination of an IP CAN bearer is performed before timer expiry,
the PCRF will receive an Indication of IP-CAN Bearer Termination Implications
according to clause 4.5.6 and shall then not perform the network-initiated
termination of that IP CAN bearer. Otherwise, if the timer expires, the PCRF
shall remove/deactivate all the PCC rules that have been previously
installed/activated for that IP-CAN bearer.
If the IP-CAN bearer termination is caused by the PS to CS handover, the PCEF
shall report related PCC rules for this IP-CAN bearer by including the Rule-
Failure-Code AVP set to the value PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER.
If the PCRF decides to remove all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN bearer due to
an internal trigger or trigger from the SPR, the PCRF shall instantly
remove/deactivate all the PCC rules that have been previously
installed/activated on that IP-CAN bearer.
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN bearer, the PCEF shall terminate
the IP CAN bearer.
## A.3.7 Request of IP-CAN Session Termination
The procedure described in clause 4.5.9 applies with the following changes:
If no more PCC rules are applied to an IP CAN session, the PCEF shall send a
PDP context deactivation request with the teardown indicator set to indicate
that the termination of the entire IP-CAN session is requested.
If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-only, and the PCRF receives a
trigger for the removal of all PCC rules bound to an IP CAN session from the
AF, the following steps apply. In order to avoid race conditions, the PCRF
should start a timer to wait for the UE-initiated bearer termination message.
If a UE-initiated bearer termination of an IP CAN session is performed before
timer expiry, the PCRF will receive an Indication of IP-CAN Session
Termination according to Clause A.3.5 and shall then not perform the network-
initiated termination of that IP CAN session. Otherwise, if the timer expires,
the PCRF shall remove/deactivate all the PCC rules that have been previously
installed or activated for that IP-CAN session.
## A.3.8 Bearer Control Mode Selection
The GGSN shall only include the Network-Request-Support AVP if it supports
this procedure and both the UE and the SGSN have previously indicated to the
GGSN (refer to 3GPP TS 23.060 [17] and 3GPP TS 29.060 [18]) that they also
support it. The Network-Request-Support AVP shall be included if the GGSN
received it from the SGSN.
The PCRF derives the Selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy. The Selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP shall be
provided to the GGSN using the PCC Rules provision procedure at IP-CAN session
establishment. The GGSN should forward it to the UE. The selected value is
applicable to all PDP Contexts within the activated PDP Address/APN pair.
The BCM selection procedure can also be triggered as a consequence of a change
of SGSN.
The values defined in 5.3.23 for the Bearer-Control-Mode AVP apply with the
following meaning:
UE_ONLY (0)
This value is used to indicate that the UE shall request any additional PDP
Context establishment.
RESERVED (1)
This value is not used in this Release.
UE_NW (2)
This value is used to indicate that both the UE and PCEF may request any
additional PDP Context establishment and add own traffic mapping information
to a PDP Context.
## A.3.9 Bearer Binding Mechanism
Refer to annex D.2 of 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
## A.3.10 Void
## A.3.11 PCC Rule Error Handling
In addition to the procedures described in clause 4.5.12 the following
procedures apply:
If the PCRF performs the bearer binding, for predefined PCC rules that contain
only uplink service data flow filters which are known to the PCRF, the PCEF
may include the Bearer-Identifier AVP within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP to
indicate the affected IP-CAN bearer from a failed PCC rule activation. If no
Bearer-Identifier is provided then the PCRF shall assume that PCC rule failed
to activate to all assigned IP-CAN bearers.
NOTE: In such a case the same PCC rule can be activated to multiple IP-CAN
bearers of the same IP-CAN session.
## A.3.12 IMS Emergency Session Support
### A.3.12.1 Request of PCC Rules for an Emergency services
The PCEF shall execute the procedures described in clause A.3.1 to Request PCC
Rules for Emergency.
A PCEF that requests PCC Rules at IP-CAN Session Establishment shall send a
CCR command with CC-Request-Type AVP set to value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the
Called-Station-Id AVP including the Emergency APN. The PCEF may include the
IMSI within the Subscription-Id AVP and if the IMSI is not available the PCEF
shall include the IMEI within the User-Equipment-Info AVP. The PCEF may
include the rest of the attributes described in clause A.3.1.
If the PCRF detects that the initial or subsequent CCR command shall be
rejected, it shall execute the procedure for the type of Gx experimental
result code described in clause A.3.1.
Any PCEF-initiated requests for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service that
include the \"TFT_CHANGE\" Event-Trigger AVP shall be rejected by the PCRF
with the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
### A.3.12.2 Provisioning of PCC Rules for an Emergency services
The PCRF shall execute the procedures described in clause A.3.2 to provision
PCC Rules.
The PCRF shall detect that a Gx session is restricted to IMS Emergency
services when a CCR command is received with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" and the Called-Station-Id AVP includes a PDN
identifier that matches one of the Emergency APNs from the configurable list.
The PCRF:
\- shall provision PCC Rules restricting the access to Emergency Services
(e.g. P-CSCF(s), DHCP(s) and DNS (s) and SUPL(s) addresses) required by local
operator policies in a CCA command according to the procedures described in
clause A.3.2.
\- may provision the authorized QoS within the QoS-Information AVP in a CCA
command according to the procedures described in clause A.3.3.1 except for
obtaining the authorized QoS upon interaction with the SPR.
\- shall assign NW mode to the PCC Rules that are bound to an IP-CAN session
restricted to Emergency services.
NOTE 1: The PCRF does not provision the authorized QoS per QCI for Gx sessions
established for the Emergency purposes.
When the PCRF receives IMS service information for an Emergency service and
derives authorized PCC Rules from the service information, the Priority-Level
AVP, the Pre-emption-Capability AVP and the Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP in
the QoS information within the PCC Rule shall be assigned values as required
by local operator policies.
If the Bearer Control Mode is assigned to \"UE_NW\" the PCRF shall assign NW
mode to the PCC Rules that are bound to an IP-CAN session restricted to
Emergency services and immediately initiate a PUSH procedure as described in
clause A.3.2 to provision PCC Rules and the procedures described in clause
A.3.3.2a to provision the authorized QoS per service data flow, except for the
QoS Information within the PCC Rules that shall be assigned a priority within
the Priority-Level AVP as required by local operator policies.
Any PCEF-initiated request for PCC Rules for an IMS Emergency service
triggered by Event-Trigger AVP assigned to \"TFT-change\" shall be rejected by
the PCRF with the error DIAMETER_ERROR_TRAFFIC_MAPPING_INFO_REJECTED.
## A.3.13 Removal of PCC Rules for Emergency Services
The reception of a request to terminate an AF session for an IMS Emergency
service by the PCRF follows the same procedure defined in clause 4.5.15.2.3.
## A.3.14 Removal of PCC Rules at Gx session termination
The reception of a request to terminate the IP-CAN session restricted to IMS
Emergency session shall follow the same procedure defined in clause
4.5.15.2.4.
## A.3.15 IMS Restoration Support
The procedure described in clause 4.5.18 applies and the monitoring procedure
is defined in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11] Section 13a.2.2.1.
## A.3.16 Provisioning of CSG information reporting indication
The PCRF may provide one or more CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs during IP-CAN
session establishment, to request the PCEF to report the user CSG information
change applicable for an IP-CAN session to the OFCS.
NOTE: The SPR can provide the Subscriber\'s User CSG Information reporting
rules to the PCRF, the SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
## A.3.17 Packet-Filter-Usage AVP
NOTE: The maximum number of packet filters sent to UE is limited as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## A.3.18 Precedence handling
PCRF provides only one precedence value per PCC rule. For network initiated
IP-CAN session modification, since one PCC rule may result in more than one
TFT filters, the PCEF shall ensure that each TFT filter is assigned unique
precedence value across all TFT filters of the corresponding PDN connection
(as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). When two PCC rules result in two sets
of TFT filters, the PCEF shall also ensure that the relative precedence of the
each set of TFT filters is same as the relative precedence of the
corresponding PCC rule. E.g. if PCC rule R1 has higher precedence than PCC
rule R2, all the TFT filters corresponding to R1 shall have higher precedence
than all the TFT filters corresponding to R2.
NOTE: The maximum value of precedence of the TFT filter is limited as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## A.3.19 Reporting Access Network Information
The procedure described in clause 4.5.22 applies.
The GGSN provides the CGI/SAI within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP.
## A.3.20 User CSG Information Reporting
If the PCEF receives the credit re-authorization triggers from the OCS and CSG
information reporting indications within the CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs
from the PCRF which request different levels of reporting of user CSG
information change for a single IP-CAN session, the PCEF should derive the
highest level of detail required and request the user CSG information change
from the SGSN as defined in 3GPP TS 29.060 [18].
NOTE: The PCEF reports the user CSG information to the OFCS on the level of
detail as requested by the PCRF within the CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs and
reports the user CSG information to the OCS on the level of detail as
requested by the OCS re-authorization triggers.

# B.3 PCC procedures
## B.3.1 Request for PCC and/or QoS rules
This procedure is defined in clauses 4.5.1 and 4a.5.1 the following specifics.
Information about the support of network-initiated bearer procedures for the
IP-CAN session shall be provided via the Gx reference point.
The PCEF shall always include the RAT-Type as part of the IP-CAN Session
Establishment procedure.
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses:
\- When the UE requests to modify the bearer QoS without specifying any TFT
filter the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\",
and shall include within the CC-Request:
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP with only the Packet-Filter-Identifier
AVP, set to the value for each of the packet filter(s) created by the UE. If
BCM is MS-only, the PCEF shall include all the packet filter identifier(s)
previously assigned on Gx for this EPS bearer within the Packet-Filter-
Identifier AVP. If BCM is MS/NW, the PCEF shall also include the SDF filter
identifier(s) that correspond to the packet filter identifier(s) in the
parameter list of the TFT within the Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the affected
packet filters; and
\- if there is no packet filter set by the network on the same bearer, the
QoS-Information AVP may indicate an updated QCI.
\- When the UE requests to add filters to an existing TFT, the PCEF shall set
the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", and shall include within
the CC-Request the request:
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each for each packet filter requested
for addition without any Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP; and
\- one Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each of the existing filter(s),
created by the UE, with the Packet-Filter-Identifier AVP and without any
filter attributes used for matching; and
\- the QoS-Information AVP to indicate the requested QoS for the affected PCC
rules.
For GERAN and UTRAN access, the relationship between the TFT operation
requested by MS and the Gx operation provided by PCEF to PCRF is as follows:
\- If the TFT operation is \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", the
PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", the
PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", the PCEF
shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Create new TFT\", the PCEF shall set the Packet-
Filter-Operation AVP to \"ADDITION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"Delete existing TFT\", the PCEF shall set the
Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\".
\- If the TFT operation is \"No TFT operation\" or the TFT is missing (allowed
in BCM MS-only only, the PCEF shall set the Packet-Filter-Operation AVP to
\"MODIFICATION\".
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, the PCRF shall provide packet filters in the PCC
rule as received in the Packet-Filter-Information AVP for each packet filter
requested by the UE.
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, if the PCRF receives a request for addition of
service data flow(s) with a reference to existing packet filter identifiers
(and by that to existing PCC rule(s)), the PCRF shall update the existing PCC
rule for the new service data flow(s) without changing the QCI and ARP.
NOTE: The reference to an existing packet filter identifiers informs the PCRF
that the request is confined to an existing bearer, having bearer bindings
with PCC rules that have the same QCI/ARP combination. Assigning a different
QCI or ARP to the new service data flows would cause the procedure to fail,
since the PCEF cannot map the new service data flows to another bearer.
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, when BCM is MS-only and the UE requests to
create a TFT for a PDP context without a TFT created by the PDP Context
Activation Procedure, the PCRF shall authorize a PCC rule which contains the
packet filters as requested by the UE when receiving the CCR request from the
PCEF. The PCEF shall install the PCC rule provisioned by the PCRF, shall
deactivate/remove the PCC rules that were previously activated/installed by
the PCRF and were bound to the same beare,r and shall send a CCR command to
the PCRF with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\",
including the Charging-Rule-Report AVP specifying the deactivated/removed PCC
rules with the PCC-Rule-Status set to inactive and including the Rule-Failure-
Code AVP assigned to the value NO_BEARER_BOUND (15).
For GERAN and UTRAN accesses, when BCM is MS-only and the UE requests to
delete the existing TFT, the PCRF should provide at least one new PCC rule to
be installed at the same time when the PCC rule corresponding to the TFT is
removed.
For E-UTRAN accesses with UE initiated resource modification procedure, the
PCRF shall either authorize the same QoS as requested QoS within the QoS-
Information AVP or reject the request if the requested QoS can not be
authorized. The PCRF may reject the request using a CC-Answer with the Gx
experimental result code DIAMETER_ERROR_INITIAL_PARAMETERS (5140). If the PCEF
receives a CC-Answer with this code, the PCEF shall reject the IP-CAN session
modification that initiated the CC-Request.
## B.3.2 Provisioning of PCC and/or QoS rules
For GTP-based 3GPP accesses, the PCRF may request the establishment of a
bearer dedicated to IMS signalling by providing the applicable PCC rules to
the PCEF.
For PMIP-based 3GPP accesses, the PCRF may request the establishment of a
bearer dedicated to IMS signalling by providing the applicable QoS rules to
the BBERF.
When the PCEF includes the Bearer-Usage AVP required for the default bearer
within the CCR command during the IP-CAN session establishment procedure, the
PCRF shall provide the Bearer-Usage AVP back in the response with the
authorized usage.
If during IP-CAN session establishment procedure, the PCEF includes
IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP and the PCRF accepts that default
bearer is dedicated to IMS signalling, the PCRF shall include the
IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP. In this case, the PCRF shall
restrict the bearer to only be used for IMS signalling as specified in 3GPP TS
23.228 [31] by applying the applicable QCI for IMS signalling.
If the PCEF include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP in the CCR
command, but the PCRF does not include the IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-
Usage AVP in the CCA command, the PCC Rules provided by the PCRF shall have a
QCI value different from the QCI value for the IMS signalling.
When UE initiates a resource modification request, if the PCEF includes the
Bearer-Usage AVP indicating IMS_SIGNALLING and the PCRF accepts that a bearer
dedicated to IMS signalling shall be used, the PCRF shall return the
IMS_SIGNALLING within the Bearer-Usage AVP. The provided PCC rules shall have
the QCI applicable for IMS signalling.
During the IP-CAN session establishment, the PCEF shall not provide packet
filters to UE on the default bearer in the IP-CAN session establishment
response, referring to 3GPP TS 29.274 [22].
## B.3.3 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
### B.3.3.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS per APN
The PCRF shall provision the authorized QoS per APN as part of the IP-CAN
session establishment procedure.
### B.3.3.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS per APN
There are no access specific procedures defined.
### B.3.3.3 QoS handling for interoperation with Gn/Gp SGSN
When the PCEF receives the establishment or modification of an IP-CAN bearer
from a Gn/Gp SGSN, the PCEF shall derive the requested QoS information in the
CC-Request command following the mapping rules included in 3GPP TS 23.401 [32]
Annex E as follows:
\- Guaranteed-Bitrate-UL AVP and Guaranteed-Bitrate-DL AVP shall be obtained
from the bearer parameter GBR received within the PDP-Context.
\- If APN-AMBR is not received within the initial PDP-Context for the IP-CAN
session, the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL AVP and APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-DL
AVP shall be mapped from the bearer parameter MBR received within the PDP-
Context. If APN-AMBR is received as a part of the initial PDP Context for the
IP-CAN session, it shall be included within the APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL
AVP and APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate DL AVP. When the PCEF receives a request for
modification of the MBR for the initial PDP context or any non-GBR PDP
context, the PCEF shall take the common flags \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" and
\"No QoS negotiation\" described down below in to consideration and act
accordingly.
\- Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP shall be derived based on the QoS bearer
parameters included in the initial PDP-Context received for the IP-CAN
session. When the PCEF receives a request for modification of the initial PDP
context that modifies either the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP or Allocation-
Retention-Priority AVP, the modified values shall be provided as part of the
Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP.
\- Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP shall be mapped one-to-one from the
Evolved ARP if this parameter is included within the PDP Context. Otherwise,
it will be derived as follows:
○ The Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP shall be
set based on operator policies.
○ The Priority-Level AVP is derived as described in table B.3.3.3.1:
Table B.3.3.3.1: Mapping of ARP to Priority-Level AVP
* * *
ARP Value Priority-Level AVP 1 1 2 H+1 3 M+1
* * *
NOTE 1: The values of H (high priority) and M (medium priority) can be set
according to operator requirements to ensure proper treatment of users with
higher priority level information. The minimum value of H is 1\. The minimum
value of M is H+1.
\- QoS-Class-Identifier AVP may be derived based on table B.3.3.3.2:
Table B.3.3.3.2: Mapping between standardized QCIs and R99 UM3GPP TS QoS

The PCEF determines R97/98 attributes from R99 attributes according to 3GPP TS
23.107 [41].
The PCRF shall provide the authorized QoS information according to clause
4.5.5.2 (when the authorized QoS applies to the service data flow), clause
4.5.5.8 (when the authorized QoS applies at APN level) or 4.5.5.9 (when the
authorized QoS applies to the default bearer).
When the PCEF receives the authorized QoS information applicable for the
service data flow, the PCEF shall act according to clause 4.5.5.3. The PCEF
shall then derive the QoS information of the PDP context from the calculated
authorized QoS as follows:
\- For non-GBR bearers, if APN-AMBR parameter was not received in the initial
PDP context for the IP-CAN session, the bearer parameter MBR shall be set to
the value of the authorized APN-Aggregate-Max-Bitrate-UL and APN-Aggregate-
Max-Bitrate-DL AVPs. For GBR-bearers the MBR and GBR of the PDP-Context shall
be mapped one-to-one from the MBR and GBR values calculated for that bearer
according to clause 4.5.5.3.
\- The Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP received as part of the PCC Rule
shall be used to bind the PCC rules to the corresponding bearer. If the SGSN
supports the Evolved ARP parameter (i.e. it was received as part of the PDP
contexts) the Evolved ARP for the PDP context shall be mapped one-to-one from
the Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP assigned to the corresponding bearer. If
the SGSN does not support Evolved ARP parameter, the the P-GW shall ignore the
Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP when deriving the
ARP of the PDP Context.
The ARP parameter is derived as described in table B.3.3.3.3:
Table B.3.3.3.3: Mapping of Priority-Level AVP to ARP
* * *
Priority-Level AVP ARP value 1 to H 1 H+1 to M 2 M+1 to 15 3
* * *
NOTE 2: The values of H (high priority) and M (medium priority) can be set
according to operator requirements to ensure proper treatment of users with
higher priority level information. The minimum value of H is 1\. The minimum
value of M is H+1.
\- The P-GW shall bind only PCC rules with the same ARP setting (Priority-
Level AVP, Pre-emption-Capability AVP and Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP) to
the same PDP context to enable modification of the bearer ARP without
impacting the assignment of services to bearers after a handover to E-UTRAN.
NOTE 3: When Evolved ARP parameter is not received as part of the PDP-Context,
any change of the bearer ARP parameter may get overwritten by the SGSN due to
subscription enforcement.
\- The PCEF may derive the Traffic Class, Traffic Handling Priority,
Signalling Indication and Source Statistics Descriptor from the QoS-Class-
Identifier AVP based on the table B.3.3.3.2. The standardized QCI
characteristics may be derived from the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP according to
table 6.1.7 in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. The derivation of other values received as
part of the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP shall be performed as defined in 3GPP TS
23.401 [32], Annex E.
Common flags \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" and \"No QoS negotiation\" shall be
handled as follows.
\- When the PCEF receives a Create PDP context request with the \"Upgrade QoS
Supported\" flag set to \"1\" in the Common Flag Information Element within
the Common Flag IE (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), normal procedures apply.
\- When the PCEF receives within the Create PDP context request the \"Upgrade
QoS Supported\" flag set to \"0\" or if it is absent, the PCEF shall contact
the PCRF including the requested QoS information derived following the mapping
rules described in this clause.When the PCEF derives the authorized UM3GPP TS
QoS information received from the PCRF according to the mapping procedures
described in this clause, it shall check
○ Whether the authorized GBR, MBR or APN-AMBR is equal to or higher than the
GBR, MBR or APN-AMBR requested from the GnGp SGSN. If it is so, the PCEF shall
accept the requested values. Otherwise the PCEF shall accept the authorized
values.
○ Whether the authorized ARP priority level is equal to or higher than the ARP
priority level requested from the GnGp SGSN. If it is so, the PCEF shall
accept the requested priority value. Otherwise the PCEF shall accept the
authorized values.
NOTE 4: The ARP priority level attribute represents the actual priority for
the service/user with the value 1 as the highest.
NOTE 5: Whether the QCI is permitted to be changed or not is subject to
operator policies and normal restrictions on changing from a Non-GBR QCI value
to GBR QCI value on a default bearer.
\- When the PCEF receives an Update PDP context request, the PCEF shall derive
the QoS information according to the mapping procedures described in this
clause and it shall check whether the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag and the
\"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flags are present. The following procedures shall
apply.
○ If the \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flag set to \"1\" and the \"No QoS
negotiation\" flag set to \"0\" or is absent, normal procedures apply with the
following exceptions when only MBR is changed:\ If the derived MBR is equal to
or less than the authorized APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall
accept the requested QoS values without interacting with the PCRF. If the
derived MBR is higher than the authorized APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the
PCEF shall send a MBR equal to the authorized APN-AMBR in the Update PDP
context response without interacting with the PCRF.
○ If the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag is set to \"1\" in the Common Flag
Information Element (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), and the derived QCI and/or ARP is
different from the QCI and/or ARP authorized for that bearer, the PCEF shall
reject the procedure. Otherwise, the next procedure shall apply.
○ If the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag is set to \"1\", if the derived MBR or
APN-AMBR is equal to or less than the authorized APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN
session, the PCEF shall accept the requested QoS values without interacting
with the PCRF. If the derived MBR or APN-AMBR is higher than the authorized
APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall reject the requested QoS
change. If the GBR is different from the authorized GBR, the PCEF shall reject
the requested QoS change.
○ If the \"Upgrade QoS Supported\" flag set to \"0\" in the Common Flag
Information Element or if the corresponding bit within the Common Flag IE is
absent (3GPP TS 29.060 [18]), and the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag is set to
\"0\" or is absent, the PCEF shall behave in the same way as when the
\"Upgrade QoS supported\" flag set to \"0\" is received in the Create PDP
Context request procedure with the following exceptions when only MBR is
changed:\ If the derived MBR is equal to or less than the authorized APN-AMBR
for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall accept the requested QoS values without
interacting with the PCRF. If the derived MBR is higher than the authorized
APN-AMBR for the IP-CAN session, the PCEF shall send a MBR equal to the
authorized APN-AMBR in the Update PDP context response without interacting
with the PCRF.
When the PCEF receives the authorized QoS information applicable for the
default bearer as part of the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS AVP, the PCEF shall then
derive the QoS information corresponding to the initial PDP Context from the
QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP, following the
same derivation rules as when the QoS information is received as part of the
PCC Rule.
When the PCEF receives the authorized QoS information applicable for the APN,
the PCEF shall act according to clause 4.5.5.8. The PCEF shall modify the MBR
for the PDP contexts with Traffic Class \'Interactive\' and \'Background\'.
When the PCEF receives the Secondary PDP Context Activation command, the PCEF
shall derive the QoS information and packet filter information, and interact
with PCRF by applying the UE initiated resource modification procedure as
specified in clause 4.5.1.
### B.3.3.4 Void
### B.3.3.5 Policy provisioning for authorized QoS per service data flow
For the authorization of a PCC rule with a GBR QCI the PCRF shall assign a GBR
value within the limit supported by the serving network (i.e. GERAN/UTRAN).
The PCRF shall subscribe the RAT_CHANGE event to get the RAT type information
for PCC rule authorization.
NOTE: For the authorization of PCC Rules with the same QCI the PCRF may also
check that aggregated GBR is within the limits supported by the serving
network to minimize the risk of rejection of the bearer by the serving
network.
## B.3.4 Packet-Filter-Information AVP
In addition to the definition of the Packet-Filter-Information AVP in clause
5.3.55, for E-UTRAN the Packet-Filter-Information AVPs shall be derived from
the information defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## B.3.5 Bearer Control Mode Selection
Bearer Control Mode Selection shall take place via the Gx reference point
according to clause 4.5.10.
## B.3.6 Trace activation/deactivation at P-GW
In case of a PMIP-based 3GPP access the S-GW sends the trace activation and
deactivation to the P-GW via the PCRF. To activate the trace, the S-GW sends
the Trace Information to the PCRF in a CCR message within a Trace-Data AVP and
with an Event-Trigger AVP containing the value PGW_TRACE_CONTROL. The PCRF
sends the Trace-Data and Event-Trigger AVPs within an Event-Report-Indication
AVP further to the P-GW in a CCA message (upon IP-CAN session establishment)
or RAR message. To deactivate the trace, the S-GW sends the Trace Reference to
the PCRF in a CCR message within a Trace-Reference AVP and with an Event-
Trigger AVP containing the value PGW_TRACE_CONTROL. The PCRF sends the Trace-
Reference and Event-Trigger AVPs within an Event-Report-Indication AVP further
to the P-GW in a RAR message.
## B.3.7 IMS Restoration Support
The procedure described in clause 4.5.18 applies and the monitoring procedure
is defined in 3GPP TS 29.061 [11] Section 13a.2.2.1.
## B.3.8 Provisioning of CSG information reporting indication
The PCRF may provide one or more CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs during IP-CAN
session establishment, to request the PCEF to report the user CSG information
change applicable for an IP-CAN session to the OFCS.
NOTE: The SPR can provide the Subscriber\'s User CSG Information reporting
rules to the PCRF, the SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
## B.3.9 Packet-Filter-Usage AVP
NOTE: The maximum number of packet filters sent to UE is limited as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## B.3.10 User CSG Information Reporting
### B.3.10.1 GTP-based S5/S8
The procedure defined in clause A.3.20 is applied except that the PCEF should
request the user CSG information change from the S-GW as defined in 3GPP TS
29.274 [22].
### B.3.10.2 PMIP-based S5/S8
The S-GW may send user CSG information to the P-GW via the PCRF.
During the IP-CAN Session Establishment, the S-GW may send the user CSG
information to the PCRF in a CC-Request command within a User-CSG-Information
AVP and the PCRF sends User-CSG-Information AVP in a CC-Answer command to the
P-GW.
The P-GW shall select and subscribe to the applicable event triggers
USER_CSG_INFORMATION_CHANGE, USER_CSG_HYBRID_SUBSCRIBED_INFORMATION_CHANGE
and/or USER_CSG_ HYBRID_UNSUBSCRIBED_INFORMATION_CHANGE within an Event-
Report-Indication AVP for reporting from the BBERF via the PCRF if the
corresponding credit re-authorization triggers are requested by the OCS. The
PCRF shall subscribe to the event triggers for the highest level of detail
required for the reporting within the user CSG information reporting rules and
Event-Report-Indication AVP to the S-GW.
The S-GW reports that user CSG information has changed with the applicable
values provided in the related Event-Trigger AVPs and, when applicable, the
new user CSG information within the User-CSG-Information AVP.
The PCRF shall send the Event-Trigger AVPs and when applicable, the User-CSG-
Information AVP within an Event-Report-Indication AVP to the P-GW in a RA-
Request command.
NOTE: The PCEF reports the user CSG information to the OFCS on the level of
detail as requested by the PCRF within the CSG-Information-Reporting AVPs and
reports the user CSG information to the OCS on the level of detail as
requested by the OCS re-authorization triggers.
## B.3.11 Request of IP-CAN Bearer Termination
For PMIP-based 3GPP accesses, if the IP-CAN bearer termination is caused by
the PS to CS handover, the BBERF reports related QoS rules for this IP-CAN
bearer by including the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to the value
PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER as part of the Gateway Control Session Modification
procedure.
For GTP-based 3GPP accesses, if the IP-CAN bearer termination is caused by the
PS to CS handover, the PCEF reports related PCC rules for this IP-CAN bearer
by including the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to the value PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER as
part of the IP-CAN session modification procedure.
## B.3.12 CS to PS handover
In order to support CS to PS handover according to 3GPP TS 23.216 [40], the
PCRF shall ensure that voice media may use the default bearer until the
appropriate bearer has been established.
If the operator policy requires a policy decision to be made in order to allow
voice media on the default bearer, the PCRF shall subscribe to the
CS_TO_PS_HANDOVER event trigger. Upon detection of CS to PS handover, the PCEF
shall generate a CS_TO_PS_HANDOVER event. In response to the event the PCRF
shall make policy decisions, for example provisioning or modifying the
appropriate PCC rules, to allow voice media on the default bearer.
NOTE 1: If the PCRF provides dynamic PCC rules to be installed in the default
bearer, the QoS-Class-Identifier AVP and Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP in
the PCC rule(s) shall be respectively set to the same value as the ones of the
default EPS bearer QoS information of the IP-CAN session.
If the PCRF received the first voice media authorized over Rx interface that
corresponds to the voice session being transferred, the PCRF shall provide the
corresponding PCC Rules and shall also subscribe to
SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION event trigger.
If the PCRF receives the SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION event trigger for the
first voice media authorized over Rx that corresponds to the voice session
being transferred and the PCRF made policy decisions upon request of the
CS_TO_PS_HANDOVER event, the PCRF should revoke that decision. In the case
there were PCC Rules related to the voice media being transferred installed in
the default bearer should be removed by the PCRF.
NOTE 2: There exists a very small possibility that another Rx session is
established before or in parallel to the IMS voice session in transfer, i.e.
due to a terminating voice session request. It is considered that this can be
avoided by implementation and is therefore out of scope of standard.
## B.3.13 Precedence handling
PCRF provides only one precedence value per PCC rule. For network initiated
IP-CAN session modification, since one PCC rule may result in more than one
TFT filters, the PCEF/BBERF has to ensure that each TFT filter is assigned
unique precedence value across all TFT filters of the corresponding PDN
connection (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [42]). When
two PCC rules result in two sets of TFT filters, the PCEF/BBERF shall also
ensure that the relative precedence of the each set of TFT filters is same as
the relative precedence of the corresponding PCC rule. E.g. if PCC rule R1 has
higher precedence than PCC rule R2, all the TFT filters corresponding to R1
shall have higher precedence than all the TFT filters corresponding to R2.
NOTE: The maximum value of precedence of the TFT filter is limited as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
## B.3.14 S-GW Restoration Support
During IP-CAN session establishment, if both the PCEF and PCRF advertise the
support for S-GW restoration, the PCRF shall subscribe to the AN_GW_CHANGE
event trigger.
When the PCRF sends a RAR or CCA command with new policy decisions for a PDN
connection maintained during a S-GW failure, the PCEF shall act as follows:
\- For MME/S4-SGSN triggered S-GW Restoration scenarios:
if the policy decisions were received in a RAR command, the PCEF shall send a
RAA command with the Experimental-Result-Code set to DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED
(4143) indicating the failure to enforce all those policy decisions.
If the installation/modification of one or more PCC rules fails the PCEF shall
reject the procedure as described in clause 4.5.12. The Rule-Failure-Code AVP
for both PULL and PUSH modes shall be set to AN_GW_FAILED (17).
If the PCRF sends a CCA that includes policy decision not related to a PCC
Rule (e.g. change of APN-AMBR), the PCEF shall send a CCR that includes the
event trigger related with the failure to enforce the corresponding policy
decision (as per the existing procedures) and the AN-GW-Status AVP set to
AN_GW_FAILED (0).
\- For P-GW triggered S-GW Restoration scenarios, the PCEF shall accept the
procedure as per normal procedures. In the case, the PDN connection is not
restored during an operator configured time period, the PCEF shall send a new
CCR command when the related timer expires. If the RAR/CCA included policy
decision related to a PCC Rule procedure, the CCR shall include the Charging-
Rule-Report AVP with the Rule-Failure-Code AVP set to
RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_FAILURE and with the PCC-Rule-Status set to INACTIVE. If
the RAR/CCA included policy decision not related to the PCC Rules (e.g. change
of APN-AMBR), the CCR shall include the event trigger related with the failure
to enforce the corresponding policy decision according to the current
procedures.
For MME/S4-SGSN triggered S-GW Restoration scenarios, while the S-GW
restoration is in progress, if the PCEF sends a CCR command towards the PCRF
that is triggered by a different event (e.g. internal event at PCEF or Gy
interface related event), the PCEF shall include the AN-GW-Status AVP set to
AN_GW_FAILED (0).
Upon reception of the Rule-Failure-Code set to AN_GW_FAILED (17), AN-GW-Status
set to AN_GW_FAILED (0) or an Experimental-Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED (4143) the PCRF shall not initiate any IP-CAN Session
Modification procedure, except if the IP-CAN Session Modification procedure is
initiated for the PCC rule removal only, for the given IP-CAN session over Gx
until the S-GW has recovered.
If the PCEF indicated AN_GW_FAILED previously according to the procedures
described above, the PCEF shall inform the PCRF when the S-GW has recovered
using the Event-Trigger AVP set to AN_GW_CHANGE and including the AN-GW-
Address AVP related to the restored or new S-GW. The PCRF may after this
update the PCEF with PCC Rules if necessary.
NOTE 1: The PCRF could reject requests from the AF and SPR when the Rule-
Failure-Code set to AN_GW_FAILED (17), the AN-GW-Status AVP set to
AN_GW_FAILED (0) or the Experimental-Result-Code set to DIAMETER_AN_GW_FAILED
(4143) is received until the Event-Trigger AVP set to AN_GW_CHANGE is
received.
The PCEF shall maintain the PDN connections affected by the S-GW failure and
eligible for restoration for an operator configurable time period (see 3GPP TS
23.007 [43]). Upon expiry of that time period, the PCEF shall release the PDN
connection and inform the PCRF about the IP-CAN Session Termination as
specified in clause 4.5.7.
NOTE 2: The PCRF is not aware of which PDN connections are eligible for
restoration. When the PCEF detects a S-GW failure, the PCEF requests the PCRF
to terminate IP-CAN sessions associated to PDN connections affected by the
S-GW failure and not eligible for restoration.
The PCEF should maintain the GBR bearers of the PDN connections eligible for
restoration for an operator configurable time period (see 3GPP TS 23.007
[43]). Upon expiry of that time period, the PCEF shall release GBR bearers
that have not yet been restored and inform the PCRF about the PCC rule removal
as specified in clause 4.5.6.
The PCEF shall discard downlink packets received for a PDN connection
maintained during a S-GW failure that has not yet been restored.
The PCEF shall delete the PDN connection locally when it receives an IP-CAN
session termination from the PCRF as described in clause 4.5.9.
For the PMIP-based 3GPP access, when the PCRF detects a BBERF failure or
restart, the PCRF shall maintain the IP-CAN sessions and delete locally the
Gateway Control sessions affected by the BBERF failure. In this case, if the
PCRF receives a request from the AF or SPR that requires to modify the IP-CAN
session and no error indication was received from the PCEF before, the PCRF
may initiate the IP-CAN session modification towards the PCEF.
NOTE 3: The method the PCRF uses to determine that a BBERF has failed or
restarted is not specified in this release.
NOTE 4: The PCRF can refrain from sending policy information within the RAR
command since it is aware that the BBERF has failed or restarted via Gxx
reference point. The PCRF will know that the BBERF has recovered when a new
Gateway Control Session Establishment is received that is linked with the
affected IP-CAN session.
## B.3.15 Reporting Access Network Information
The procedure described in clause 4.5.22 or clause 4a.5.16 applies.
In case of a GTP-based 3GPP access the P-GW provides the CGI/SAI/ECGI within
the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP.
In case of a PMIP-based 3GPP access the S-GW provides the CGI/SAI/ECGI within
the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP.
If the ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT event trigger is set, upon installation,
modification and removal of any PCC/QoS rule(s) with the Required-Access-Info
AVP the PCEF/BBERF shall send an appropriate \"Bearer Setup Request\",
\"Update Bearer Request\" or \"Delete Bearer Request\". The response message
will include the access network information to the PDN GW.
NOTE: No specific request for location information reporting is required
within those request messages.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Access specific aspects (EPC-based Non-3GPP)
# D.1 Scope
This annex defines access specific procedures for use of Gxx between PCRF and
a Non-3GPP access connected to EPC. Gx interface applies between the PCRF and
the PCEF and shall follow the procedures within the main body of this
specification.
If an EPC-based non-3GPP access (3GPP TS 23.402 [23]) requires Gxx for dynamic
QoS control then it shall include the BBERF. The allocation of a BBERF to a
node within the non-3GPP IP‑CAN is out of 3GPP scope, unless otherwise
specified in this Annex.
# D.2 EPC-based eHRPD Access
## D.2.1 General
In case of EPC-based eHRPD access the BBERF is located in the HRPD Serving
Gateway (HSGW) as defined in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [24].
The HSGW of an EPC-based eHRPD access that supports a Gxa interface shall
support all the Gxa procedures defined in this specification.
During the pre-registration phase in case of optimised EUTRAN-to-HRPD
handovers, the Serving GW and the HSGW are associated with the IP‑CAN
session(s) of the UE in the PCRF. The HSGW is the non-primary BBERF.
## D.2.2 Gxa procedures
### D.2.2.1 Request for QoS rules
The procedures specified in clause 4a.5.1 apply with the following additions.
At gateway control session establishment as described in clause 4a.5.1, the
information about the radio access technology shall be provided. The BBERF
includes also the BSID if available. If information about the support of
network-initiated QoS procedures is available, the Network-Request-Support AVP
shall be provided.
When the PCRF receives a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the value
\"INITIAL_REQUEST\", the IP-CAN-Type AVP set to the value \"Non-3GPP-EPS\",
the RAT-Type AVP set to the value \"EHRPD\" from a new BBERF and at least one
Gateway Control Session for the same user identity and PDN ID exists, and if
the UE has acquired an IPv6 prefix via the 3GPP access, the PCRF shall provide
the IPv6 prefix of the UE to the BBERF by including the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP
in the CCA command.
NOTE: In order to allow the PCRF to link the new Gateway Control session to a
Gx session based on the information received in the CCR command, it is assumed
that there is only a single IP-CAN session per PDN ID and user identity.
When UE requests the establishment or modification of resources, the BBERF
shall map the requested QoS information to the QoS-Information AVP following
the guideline described in clause D.2.4.
### D.2.2.2 Provisioning of QoS rules
#### D.2.2.2.1 QoS rule request for services not known to PCRF
When the PCRF receives a request for QoS rules while no suitable authorized
PCC/QoS rules are configured in the PCRF, and if the user is not allowed to
access AF session based services but is allowed to request resources for
services not known to the PCRF, to the procedures specified in clause 4.5.2.0
apply. In addition, the PCRF may downgrade the bitrate parameters and the QCI
according to operator policies when authorizing the request.
### D.2.2.3 Provisioning and Policy Enforcement of Authorized QoS
#### D.2.2.3.1 Provisioning of authorized QoS
When receiving a CCR with a QoS-Information AVP, the PCRF shall decide upon
the requested QoS information within the CCR command.
\- The PCRF may compare the authorized QoS derived according to Clause 6.3 of
3GPP TS 29.213 [8] with the requested QoS for the service data flow. If the
requested QoS is less than the authorised QoS, the PCRF may either request to
upgrade the IP CAN QoS by supplying that authorised QoS in the QoS-Information
AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP to the BBERF (e.g. if the PCRF has
exact knowledge of the required QoS for the corresponding service), or the
PCRF may only authorise the requested QoS by supplying the requested QoS in
the QoS-Information AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP to the BBERF (e.g.
if the PCRF only derives upper limits for the authorized QoS for the
corresponding service data flow). If the requested QoS is higher than the
authorised QoS, the PCRF shall downgrade the IP CAN QoS by supplying the
authorised QoS in the QoS-Information AVP within the QoS-Rule-Definition AVP
to the BBERF.
The PCRF may decide to modify the authorized QoS at any time. The PCRF shall
send an unsolicited authorization to the BBERF as described in 4a.5.2. If the
trigger to modify the authorized QoS comes from the AF, before starting an
unsolicited provisioning, the PCRF may start a timer to wait for a UE
requested corresponding QoS modification. At the expiry of the timer, if no
QoS rule request has previously been received by the PCRF, the PCRF should go
on with the unsolicited authorization as explained above.
#### D.2.2.3.2 Policy enforcement for authorized QoS
The procedures as described in 4a.5.10 apply with the following additions.
Upon reception of an authorized QoS within a CCA or RAR command, the BBERF
shall perform the mapping from that \"Authorised QoS\" information into
authorised access specific QoS information according to guidelines described
in Clause D.2.4.
When the BBERF receives an unsolicited authorisation decision from the PCRF
(i.e. a decision within a RAR) with updated QoS information, the BBERF shall
update the stored authorised QoS. If the existing QoS of the IP-CAN bearer
does not match the updated authorised QoS the BBERF shall perform a network
initiated QoS modification to adjust the QoS to the authorised level.
## D.2.3 Bearer Control Mode Selection
Bearer Control Mode selection shall take place via Gxa reference point to the
HSGW.
The HSGW shall only include the Network-Request-Support AVP if it supports
this the network-initiated bearer setup procedure and the UE has previously
indicated to the HSGW that the UE also support it.
The PCRF derives the selected Bearer-Control-Mode AVP based on the received
Network-Request-Support AVP, access network information, subscriber
information and operator policy. The PCRF selects the same Bearer Control Mode
for all PDN connections from a UE to the same APN. The selected Bearer-
Control-Mode AVP shall be provided to the HSGW using the QoS rule provision
procedures at Gateway control session establishment.
The BCM selection procedure may also be triggered as a consequence of a change
of HSGW.
The values defined in 5.3.23 for the Bearer-Control-Mode AVP apply with the
following meaning:
UE_ONLY (0)
This value is used to indicate that the UE shall request any additional
resource establishment.
RESERVED (1)
This value is not used in this Release.
UE_NW (2)
This value is used to indicate that both the UE and the BBERF may request any
additional bearer establishment and add additional traffic mapping information
to an existing bearer.
## D.2.4 QoS Mapping
### D.2.4.1 QCI to eHRPD QoS parameter mapping
The mapping of QCI to eHRPD QoS parameters follows the guidelines described
3GPP2 X.S0057 [24].
# D.3 EPC-based Trusted WLAN Access with S2a
For EPC-based trusted WLAN Access with S2a, the PCEF is located in the P-GW
and the BBERF does not apply.
NOTE: Gxa interface is not used for S2a-PMIP in Trusted WLAN within this
release of the specification.
The PCEF provides the PCRF with the access information as described in clause
4.5.1, with the exception of the location information that, if available, is
included in the TWAN-Identifier AVP.
###### ## Annex E (normative): Access specific aspects, Fixed Broadband Access
interworking with EPC
# E.1 Scope
This annex defines access specific aspects procedures for use of Gx, Gxx and
S15 between PCRF and PCEF, BBERF(ePDG/S-GW) and HNB GW respectively.
# E.2 Definitions and abbreviations
## E.2.1 Definitions
**UE local IP address** is defined as: either the public Ipv4 address and/or
Ipv6 address assigned to the UE by the BBF domain in the no-NAT case, or the
public Ipv4 address assigned by the BBF domain to the NATed RG that is used
for this UE.
**H(e)NB local IP address** is defined as: either the public IP Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 address assigned to the H(e)NB by the BBF domain in the no-NAT
case, or the public Ipv4 address assigned by the BBF domain to the NATed RG
that is used for this H(e)NB.
**Non-seamless WLAN offload (NSWO)** is defined as: a capability of routing
specific IP flows over the WLAN access without traversing the EPC as defined

# E.3 Reference points and Reference model
## E.3.0 General
For Fixed Broadband Access network interworking, the applied scenarios of case
1, case 2a and case 2b are defined in clause E.4.1 in 3GPP TS 29.213 [8].
## E.3.1 Gx Reference Point
In addition to the specification of the Gx reference point defined in clause
4, this reference point is also used to transport, for case 1:
\- The UE local IP address, the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel if the
NA(P)T is detected and ePDG IP address when GTP-based S2b is used in the WLAN
scenario.
\- The UE local IP address, the UDP source port number of DSMIPv6 binding
update signalling (user plane traffic is not encapsulated by Ipsec), UDP
source port number of IPSec tunnel (user plane traffic is encapsulated by
Ipsec) if the NA(P)T is detected and P-GW IP address when trusted S2c is used
in the WLAN scenario.
\- The H(e)NB local IP address and the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel
if the NA(P)T is detected for GTP-based S5/S8 is used in the H(e)NB scenario.
## E.3.2 Gxx Reference Point
This reference point is defined between the PCRF and the BBERF which is
located at the ePDG or S-GW for PMIP-based S5/S8. It is used to transport:
\- The UE local IP address, the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel if the
NA(P)T is detected, and ePDG IP address when PMIP based S2b (case 2b) or
untrusted S2c (case 2a) is used in the WLAN scenario (BBERF located at the
ePDG).
\- The H(e)NB local IP address and the UDP source port number of IPSec tunnel
if the NA(P)T is detected for PMIP based S5/S8 (case 2b) in the H(e)NB
scenario (BBERF located at the S-GW).
When the BBERF is located at the ePDG, no QoS Rules should be sent over the
Gxx reference point.
## E.3.3 S15 Reference Point
The S15 reference point is located between the HNB GW and the PCRF and between
the HNB GW and the V-PCRF. It enables provisioning and removal of dynamic QoS
rules from the (V-) PCRF to the BPCF for the purpose of allocation and release
of QoS resources in the Fixed Broadband Access Network for HNB CS calls.
## E.3.3a Sd Reference Point
This reference point is an intra-operator interface between the TDF and the
(V-)PCRF for the NSWO traffic. Scenarios where NSWO traffic is routed via the
TDF are therefore limited to the case where the Fixed Broadband Access Network
and the PLMN are owned by the same operator.
## E.3.4 Reference Model
The relationships between the different functional entities involved for EPC-
routed traffic are depicted in figure E.3.4.1 and E.3.4.2.
Figure E.3.4.1: Gx, Gxx and S15 reference point at the Policy and Charging
Control (PCC) architecture with SPR
Figure E.3.4.2: Gx, Gxx and S15 reference point at the Policy and Charging
Control (PCC) architecture with UDR
The relationships between the different functional entities involved for NSWO
traffic are depicted in figure E.3.4.3 and E.3.4.4.
Figure E.3.4.3: Sd reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with SPR
Figure E.3.4.4: Sd reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with UDR
NOTE 1: The TDF in this architecture is used with traffic that is non-seamless
WLAN offloaded in the Fixed Broadband Access Network.
NOTE 2: Sd is an intra-operator interface. Scenarios where non-seamless WLAN
offloaded traffic is routed via the TDF are therefore limited to the case
where the Fixed Broadband Access Network and the PLMN are owned by the same
operator.
# E.4 Functional Elements

\- Support the reporting of the QoS information of CS session to the PCRF so
as to trigger the PCRF to request allocation of resources in the Fixed
Broadband access network.
\- Support the reporting of the HNB local IP address and if available UDP
source port number.
# E.5 PCC procedures
## E.5.1 PCC procedures over Gx reference point
The PCC procedures over Gx reference point defined in clause 4.5 shall apply.
In addition, to support interworking with Fixed Broadband Access networks,
during the IP-CAN session establishment or modification, the PCEF may include

### E.5.2.4 Request of Gateway Control Session Termination
Procedure defined in clause 4a.5.4 shall apply.
NOTE: BBERF(ePDG) does not need to remove/deactivate the QoS rule because the
QoS rule are not applicable to the BBERF(ePDG).
## E.5.3 S15 Procedures
### E.5.3.1 S15 Session Establishment
The HNB GW initiates an S15 Session Establishment with the PCRF if the HNB
registers to the HNB GW.
The HNB GW shall send a CC-Request with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\", The CCR command shall include the HNB Local IP
address within the HeNB-Local-IP-Address AVP and the UDP source port number of
IPSec tunnel within the UDP-Source-Port AVP if available.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the HNB GW.
### E.5.3.2 S15 Session Modification
#### E.5.3.2.1 S15 Session Modification initiated by the HNB GW
The HNB GW initiates an S15 session modification with the PCRF if the HNB GW
receives the RAB assignment message to request, modify and cancel the resource
for the CS service.
The HNB GW shall send a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value \"UPDATE_REQUEST\".
When the RAB assignment requests to allocate new resources, the HNB GW shall
include the requested QoS information which is derived from the RAB message
within the QoS-Information AVP, and the QoS request identifier assigned by the
HNB GW within CS-Service-QoS-Request-Identifier AVP in the CCR command.
When the RAB assignment requests to modify existing resources, the HNB GW
shall set the CS-Service-QoS-Request-Operation AVP to \"MODIFICATION\", the
HNB GW shall also include the requested QoS information which is derived from
the RAB message within the QoS-Information AVP and the QoS request identifier
assigned by the HNB GW within CS-Service-QoS-Request-Identifier AVP in the CCR
command.
When the RAB assignment requests to delete resources the HNB GW shall set the
CS-Service-QoS-Request-Operation AVP to \"DELETION\", and shall also include
the QoS request identifier assigned by the HNB GW within CS-Service-QoS-
Request-Identifier AVP in the CCR command.
#### E.5.3.2.2 S15 Session Modification initiated by the PCRF
The PCRF initiates an S15 session modification with the HNB GW if the PCRF
receives the QoS rule failure report with the PCC-Rule-Status AVP set to the
value \"INACTIVE\" from the BPCF.
The PCRF shall include the CS-Service-Resource-Report AVP in the RAR command
with the CS-Service-Resource-Result-Operation AVP set to the value
\"DELETION\", the CS-Service-QoS-Request-Identifier AVP containing the QoS
request identifier corresponding to the QoS rule reported by the BPCF and the
CS-Service-Resource-Failure-Cause AVP indicating the reason why the resource
is released.
The HNB GW shall initiate RAB modification or RAB release procedure to release
the corresponding resource allocated in the 3GPP network as defined in 3GPP TS
23.060 [17].
### E.5.3.3 S15 Session Termination
The HNB GW initiates the S15 session termination with the PCRF if the HNB GW
initiates deregistration for the HNB or receives the deregistration request
from the HNB.
The HNB GW shall send a CC-Request with CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
\"TERMINATION_REQUEST\".
If the HNB GW needs to send an S15 Session termination request towards a PCRF
which is known to have restarted since the S15 Session establishment, the HNB
GW should not send CC-Request to inform the PCRF.
When the PCRF receives the CC-Request, it shall acknowledge this message by
sending a CC-Answer to the HNB GW.
## E.5.4 ADC procedures over Sd reference point for solicited application
reporting
### E.5.4.1 TDF session establishment
If PCRF decides, based on subscriber\'s profile configuration, that the TDF
session should be established with the TDF per corresponding IP-CAN session,
during the IP-CAN session establishment or at any point of time when the PCRF
decides that the session with TDF is to be established (e.g. subscriber
profile changes), the PCRF shall indicate via the Sd reference point, the ADC
rules to be applied at the TDF. The TDF-Information AVP shall be either
received over S9a within initial CC-Request received from BPCF or pre-
provisioned at PCRF.
NOTE: In case the TDF-Information is pre-provisioned in the PCRF and also the
value is received in CC-Request from the BPCF, the value received in CC-
Request takes precedence over the pre-provisioned value.
When establishing the session with the TDF, the PCRF shall send a TS-Request
with the PDN information (NSWO-APN), if available, within the Called-Station-
Id AVP, the UE Local IP address within the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or the
Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP.
## E.5.5 ADC procedures over Sd reference point for unsolicited application
reporting
### E.5.5.1 General
For provisioning of ADC Rules and Application Detection Information reporting
the procedures described in clauses 4b.5a.1 and 4b.5a.2 apply respectively.
For the request of TDF Session Termination, the procedure described in clause
4b.5a.3 applies, with the exemption that the release of Ipv4 address in a dual
stack scenario is notified with the S9a* Session Termination for that Ipv4
address.
### E.5.5.2 TDF session to S9a* session linking
When the PCRF receives the CCR command with the CC-Request-Type set to the
value \"INITIAL_REQUEST\" over Sd reference point, the PCRF links the TDF
session to an S9a* session, if the Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address of the TDF
session matches the UE local IP address of the S9a* session. The PDN
information (i.e NSWO-APN) if available in the Called-Station-Id AVP may also
be used for this session linking.
The TDF should handle each Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix, assuming the max
prefix length used in the access network, within a separate TDF session.
NOTE 1: In a dual-stack scenario where a 3GPP UE in the Broadband Fixed Access
Network is allocated an Ipv6 address/prefix and an Ipv4 address, this would
result in two S9a* sessions. The PCRF would link the Ipv4 address related TDF
session and Ipv6 address related TDF session for the same UE to the different
S9a* sessions.
NOTE 2: In the scenario where the TDF performs initial Application Detection
on 193ultiple simultaneous traffic flows for the same Ipv6 prefix (i.e. two or
more traffic flows from Ipv6 addresses of the same IP-CAN session) the TDF
could not be aware that those flows belong to the same IP-CAN session until a
response is received from the PCRF, containing the Ipv6 prefix. This leads to
using separate TDF sessions for the Ipv6 addresses for the same IP-CAN
session. The TDF reports new application detection information related to that
Ipv6 prefix via any of the TDF sessions at a later stage.
# E.6 S15 Protocol
## E.6.1 Protocol support
The S15 application is defined as a vendor specific Diameter application,
where the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the S15 Application in the
present release is 16777318. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) must be configured appropriately to identify
the 3GPP S15 application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order to create
suitable routeing tables.
Due to the definition of the commands used in S15 protocol, there is no
possibility to skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP instead. Therefore the S15 application identification shall
be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the S15 interface, the PCRF
acts as a Diameter server, the HNB GW acts as the Diameter client.
## E.6.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each PCRF and HNB
GW pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance
of connections between Diameter nodes is described in IETF RFC 3588 [5].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the HNB GW shall
advertise the support of the S15 specific Application by including the value
of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of
the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id
AVP contained in the Capabilities‑Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter base protocol (IETF RFC 3588
[5]).
The termination of the Diameter user session on S15 can be initiated by the
HNB GW, as specified in clause E.5.3.3.
## E.6.3 S15 specific AVPs
### E.6.3.1 General
Table E.6.3.1.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the S15 reference
point, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the
AVP may be encrypted, what access types (e.g. 3GPP-EPS, etc.) the AVP is
applicable to, the applicability of the AVPs to charging control, policy
control or both, and which supported features the AVP is applicable to. The
Vendor-Id header of all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to
3GPP (10415).

## E.6.4 S15 re- used AVPs
### E.6.4.1 General
Table E.6.4.1.1 lists the Diameter AVPs re-used by the S15 reference point
from Gx reference point and other existing Diameter Applications, reference to
their respective specifications, short description of their usage within the
S15 reference point and the applicability of the AVPs to a specific access.
When reused from Gx reference point, the specific clause in the present
specification is referred. Other AVPs from existing Diameter Applications,
except for the AVPs from Diameter base protocol, do not need to be supported.
The AVPs from Diameter base protocol are not included in table E.6.4.1.1, but
they are re-used for the S15 reference point. Unless otherwise stated, re-used
AVPs shall maintain their \'M\', \'P\' and \'V\' flag settings. Where RADIUS
VSAs are re-used, unless otherwise stated, they shall be translated to
Diameter AVPs as described in IETF RFC 4005 [12] with the exception that the
\'M\' flag shall be set and the \'P\' flag may be set.

### E.6.4.2 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the S15 reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request of a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the S15 reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
on the Cx reference point as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14].
The base functionality for the S15 reference point is the 3GPP Rel-11 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the S15 commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [14], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [14], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the S15 reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the S15 reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [14]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial CCR/CCA command pair:
\- If the HNB GW supports post-Rel-11 S15 functionality, the CCR shall include
the features supported by the HNB GW within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the
\'M\' bit cleared.
NOTE: One instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.
\- If the CCR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-11 S15 functionality, the CCA command shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both HNB GW and PCRF shall behave as
specified in the Rel-11 version of this document.
Once the HNB GW and PCRF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
## E.6.5 S15 specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
### E.6.5.1 General
IETF RFC 3588 [5] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID
AVP and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP
Code 298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value
representing the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be
set to 3GPP (10415).
### E.6.5.2 Success
Result Codes that fall within the Success category are used to inform a peer
that a request has been successfully completed.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 3588
[5], shall be applied.
### E.6.5.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted again.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 3588
[5], are applicable.
### E.6.5.4 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to inform a
peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received, but
may be able to satisfy the request in the future.
The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 3588
[5], are applicable.
## E.6.6 S15 Messages
### E.6.6.1 S15 Application
S15 Messages are carried within the Diameter Application(s) described in
clause E.6.1.
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 3588
[5], and the Diameter Credit Control Application, IETF RFC 4006 [9], are used
with the S15 specific AVPs specified in clause E.6.3. The Diameter Credit
Control Application AVPs and AVPs from other Diameter applications that are
re-used are defined in clause E.6.4. Due to the definition of these commands
there is no possibility to skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use the
Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP instead. Therefore the S15 application
identifier shall be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP. A diameter
session needs to be established for each S15 session.
NOTE: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original message definition in the DCC Application, IETF RFC 4006 [9],
or Diameter base protocol, IETF RFC 3588 [5].
### E.6.6.2 CC-Request (CCR) Command
The CCR command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 and the \'R\'
bit set in the Command Flags field, is sent by the HNB GW to the PCRF in order
