# 1 Scope
The present document describes the Mobility Management Entity (MME) and
Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) related diameter-based interfaces towards the
Home Subscriber Server (HSS) or the CSG Subscriber Server (CSS), and the MME
and the SGSN related diameter-based interface towards the Equipment Identity
Register (EIR).
This specification defines the Diameter application for the MME-HSS, S6a
reference point, for the MME-CSS, S7a reference point, for the SGSN-HSS, S6d
reference point, and for the SGSN-CSS, S7d reference point. The interactions
between the HSS/CSS and the MME/SGSN are specified, including the signalling
flows.
This specification defines the Diameter application for the MME-EIR, S13
reference point, and for the SGSN-EIR, S13\' reference point. The interactions
between the MME/SGSN and the EIR are specified, including the signalling
flows.
In this specification, if there is no specific indication, the following
principles apply:
\- \"SGSN\" refers to an SGSN which at least supports the S4 interface and may
support Gn and Gp interfaces.
\- \"S4-SGSN\" refers to an SGSN which supports the S4 interface and does not
support Gn and Gp interfaces.
\- Gn/Gp-SGSN refers to an SGSN which supports the Gn and Gp interfaces and
does not support S4 interface.
\- \"GPRS subscription data\" refers to the parameters in the HLR column in
Table 5.2. in 3GPP TS 23.008 [30].
\- \"EPS subscription data\" refers to the parameters in the HSS column in
Table 5.2A-1 in 3GPP TS 23.008 [30].
The Evolved Packet System stage 2 description (architecture and functional
solutions) is specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2] and in 3GPP TS 23.060 [12].

##### 5.2.1.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
The MME shall make use of this procedure to update the MME identity stored in
the HSS (e.g. at initial attach, inter MME tracking area update or radio
contact after HSS reset).
The SGSN shall make use of this procedure to update the SGSN identity stored
in the HSS (e.g. at initial attach, inter SGSN routing area update or radio
contact after HSS reset).
The MME shall make use of this procedure to request SMS data and and to become
registered for SMS.
The SGSN shall make use of this procedure to request to become registered for
SMS.
A combined MME/SGSN which uses different Diameter Identities for the MME and
SGSN parts shall not send a second ULR when in a first ULA the ULA-Flag
\"Separation Indication\" was not set.
For UEs receiving emergency services, in which the UE was not successfully
authenticated, the MME or SGSN shall not make use of the Update Location
procedure.
If the Update Location request is to be sent due to an inter node (SGSN to
MME) update and the previous SGSN is a Gn/Gp SGSN, the MME shall set the
\"Single-Registration-Indication\" flag in the ULR-Flags information element
in the request.
If the Update Location request is to be sent due to an initial attach, the MME
or SGSN shall set the \"Initial-Attach-Indicator\" flag in the ULR-Flags
information element in the request.
A combined MME/SGSN shall set the \"Skip Subscriber Data\" flag in the ULR-
Flags if subscriber data are already available due to a previous location
update.
A combined MME/SGSN that has chosen the option to include the SGSN Number
within ULR sent over S6a shall be prepared to receive a single subscription
data update message (IDR or DSR) from the HSS when the subscription data is
modified.
If the MME or SGSN knows about the homogeneity of the support of IMS Voice
over PS Sessions in all TAs or RAs associated to that serving node (i.e., it
is supported in all the TA/RAs or it is not supported in any of the TA/RAs)
and for the served subscriber taking into account roaming relationship for IMS
Voice over PS Sessions, it shall include this indication to the HSS in the
\"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" IE.
The MME or SGSN may include dynamic APN and PGW ID data in the list of Active-
APN AVPs, in order to restore this information in the HSS after a Reset
procedure.
The MME/SGSN may include an equivalent PLMN list to request the CSG
Subscription data of the equivalent PLMNs.
A standalone MME shall not indicate its support for any SGSN specific
features, and it shall not request explicitly the download of GPRS data (via
the GPRS-Subscription-Data-Indicator flag; see clause 7.3.7). A standalone MME
that does not support the \"SMS in MME\" feature shall not provide its MME
Number for SMS, \"SMS only\" indication or SMS Registraton Request and
therefore not indicate its support for any SMS related features (such as ODB
or barring services).
For a standalone MME or SGSN, if EPS or GPRS subscription data is received,
the standalone MME or SGSN shall replace all of the EPS or GPRS subscription
data of the user in the MME or SGSN. Any optional EPS or GPRS data not
received, but stored in the standalone MME or SGSN, shall be deleted.
For a combined MME/SGSN, if EPS subscription data of the user is received, it
shall replace all of the EPS subscription data of the user. Any optional EPS
data not received by the combined MME/ SGSN, but stored in the MME/SGSN, shall
be deleted.
For a combined MME/SGSN, if GPRS subscription data of the user is received, it
shall replace all of the GPRS subscription data of the user. Any optional GPRS
data not received by the combined MME/ SGSN, but stored in the MME/SGSN, shall
be deleted.
When receiving an Update Location response from the HSS, the MME or SGSN shall
check the result code. If it indicates success the MME or SGSN shall store the
received subscription profile (if any), and it shall store the HSS identity as
received in the Origin-Host AVP.
If an Additional MSISDN (A-MSISDN) is available in the subscription data and
downloaded in the A-MSISDN AVP to the MME/SGSN in an Update Location and if
the MME or SGSN supports the additional MSISDN feature, the MME or SGSN shall
use the Additional MSISDN as C-MSISDN.
For UEs receiving emergency services (i.e. emergency attached UEs or normal
attached UEs with a UE Requested PDN Connection for emergency services), and
if the MME or SGSN supports emergency services for users in limited service
state, the MME or SGSN shall proceed even if the Update Location procedure
fails (e.g. authenticated users with roaming restrictions or RAT-Type
restrictions in HSS).
When receiving GPRS-Subscription-Data AVP in the response, the SGSN or
combined MME/SGSN shall delete all the stored PDP-Contexts, if there are any,
and then store all the received PDP-Contexts.
When receiving the APN-Configuration-Profile AVP in a ULA, the MME or SGSN
shall delete all the stored APN-Configurations, if there are any, and then
store all the received APN-Configurations.
For each of the received APN-Configurations in the APN-Configuration-Profile,
if both the MIP6-Agent-Info and the PDN-GW-Allocation-Type AVPs are absent in
the APN-Configuration AVP, the MME or SGSN shall perform the PGW selection
(static or dynamic) according to the local configuration. If MIP6-Agent-Info
is present, and PDN-GW-Allocation-Type is not present, this means that the PDN
GW address included in MIP6-Agent-Info has been statically allocated. If the
MIP6-Agent-Info contains an FQDN of the PDN GW, the MME shall retrieve the PGW
PLMN ID from the MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP within the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.
If the MME/SGSN supports interworking with Gn/Gp-SGSNs, it shall ensure that
the context identifier sent over GTPv1 for each of the received APN-
Configurations is within the range of 0 and 255.
NOTE 1: If the MME/SGSN receives from HSS a Contex-Identifier value higher
than 255, how this value is mapped to a value between 0 and 255 is
implementation specific.
If the subscriber is not roaming and the SIPTO-Permission information for an
APN is present, the MME or SGSN shall allow SIPTO for that APN only if the
SIPTO-Permission information indicates so.
If the subscriber is not roaming and the SIPTO-Permission information for an
APN is not present, the MME or SGSN may allow SIPTO for that APN.
If the subscriber is roaming and the SIPTO-Permission information for an APN
is present, the MME or SGSN shall allow SIPTO for that APN only if the SIPTO-
Permission information indicates so and the VPLMN Dynamic Address is allowed
and the MME or SGSN selects a PDN GW in the VPLMN.
If the subscriber is roaming and the SIPTO-Permission information for an APN
is not present, the MME or SGSN shall not allow SIPTO for that APN.
NOTE 2: Based on local configuration, the MME or SGSN can determine not to
allow SIPTO for an APN, regardless if the SIPTO-Permission information is
present.
If MPS-Priority AVP is present and the UE is subscribed to the eMLPP or 1x RTT
priority service in the CS domain as indicated by the MPS-CS-Priority bit of
the AVP, the MME shall allow the UE to initiate the RRC connection with higher
priority than other normal UEs during CS Fallback procedure. If the MPS-
Priority AVP is present and the UE is subscribed to MPS in the EPS domain as
indicated by the MPS-EPS-Priority bit of the AVP, the MME shall allow the UE
to initiate the RRC connection with higher priority than other normal UEs.
If the subscriber is not roaming, the MME or SGSN may allow or prohibit the UE
to use LIPA as indicated by LIPA-Permission for a specific APN.
If the subscriber is roaming and the VPLMN-LIPA-Allowed AVP indicates that the
UE is not allowed to use LIPA in the VPLMN where the UE is attached, the MME
or SGSN shall not provide LIPA for the UE and shall not consider the LIPA-
Permission AVP. If the VPLMN-LIPA-Allowed AVP indicates that the UE is allowed
to use LIPA in the VPLMN, the MME or SGSN may allow or prohibit the UE to use
LIPA as indicated by LIPA-Permission for a specific APN. The VPLMN-Dynamic-
Address-Allowed AVP shall not be considered if it is received when the MME or
SGSN establishes a PDN connection with LIPA.
If the LIPA-Permission information for an APN indicates LIPA only, the MME or
SGSN shall only allow LIPA for that APN via the authorized CSGs according to
the CSG Subscription Data. If the LIPA-Permission information for an APN
indicates LIPA prohibited, the MME or SGSN shall not allow LIPA for that APN.
If the LIPA-Permission information for an APN indicates LIPA conditional, the
MME or SGSN shall allow non LIPA, and LIPA for that APN via the authorized
CSGs according to the CSG Subscription Data. If the LIPA-Permission AVP is not
present for a specific APN, the APN shall not be allowed to use LIPA.
The LIPA-Permission information for the Wildcard APN shall apply to any APN
that is not explicitly present in the subscription data.
The SIPTO-Permission information for the Wildcard APN shall apply to any APN
that is not explicitly present in the subscription data.
If the subscription data received for a certain APN indicates that the APN was
authorized as a consequence of having the Wildcard APN in the user
subscription in HSS, then the MME shall not store this APN data beyond the
lifetime of the UE session and the MME shall delete them upon disconnection of
the UE.
If the MME supports the Relay Node functionality (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [40]) and
the subscription data indicates that the subscriber is not a relay, the MME
shall reject the attach request from a device attempting to attach to EPS as a
Relay Node. If a device requests to be attached to EPS as an UE, the MME shall
proceed with the attach procedure regardless of the content of the Relay Node
Indicator.
If trace data are received in the subscriber data, the MME or SGSN shall start
a Trace Session. For details, see 3GPP TS 32.422 [23].
If the Ext-PDP-Type AVP is present in the PDP-Context AVP, the SGSN or
combined MME/SGSN shall ignore the value of the PDP-Type AVP.
If the subscriber is not roaming and the Subscribed-Periodic-RAU-TAU-Timer
information is present, the MME or SGSN shall allocate the subscribed value to
the UE as periodic RAU or TAU timer. If the subscriber is roaming and the
Subscribed-Periodic-RAU-TAU-Timer information is present, the MME or SGSN may
use the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer value as an indication to decide for
allocating a locally configured periodic RAU/TAU timer value to the UE.
If the MME supports the \"SMS in MME\" feature and the UE has requested a
combined EPS/IMSI attach or Combined TA/LA Update, as described in 3GPP TS
23.272 [44] and the MME is not currently registered for SMS, the MME requests
to be registered for SMS by indicating its MME Number for SMS in the request,
including SMS-Register-Request AVP and the SMS-Only-Indication flag set in the
ULR-Flags AVP if UE indicates \"SMS only\".
If the HSS provides the MME with SMS data in the ULA and the ULA-Flags is
received with \"MME Registered for MT SMS\" flag set, the MME shall store this
data for providing SMS in MME service and consider itself registered for SMS.
If the SGSN supports the \"SMS in SGSN\" feature as specified in 3GPP TS
23.060 [12], clause 5.3.18, and wishes to provide SMS via SGSN it shall set
the \"SMS in SGSN\" flag in the Feature-List AVP, and include SMS-Register-
Request AVP. If the UE has indicated \"SMS-Only\" this shall be indicated to
the HSS setting the SMS-Only--Indication flag in the ULR-Flags AVP.
NOTE: the setting of the \"SMS in SGSN\" feature bit reflects the \"SMS in
SGSN Offered\" as described in stage 2 above.
If the SMS-In-SGSN-Allowed-Indication flag is set in the received
Subscription-Data-Flags AVP, the SGSN shall store the subscription data for
providing SMS in SGSN service.
If the subscriber is not roaming and the Restoration-Priority information for
a certain APN is present, the MME or SGSN shall consider the subscribed value
as the relative priority of the user\'s PDN connection among PDN connections
to the same APN when restoring PDN connections affected by an SGW or PGW
failure/restart (see 3GPP TS 23.007 [43]). If the subscriber is roaming and
the Restoration-Priority information for a certain APN is present, the MME or
SGSN may use the subscribed value as an indication of the relative priority of
the user\'s PDN connection among PDN connections to the same APN based on
service level agreements. The MME/SGSN may use a locally configured value as
default restoration priority if the Restoration-Priority AVP for a certain APN
is not present, or if it is not permitted by service level agreements for an
in-bound roamer.
##### 5.2.1.1.3 Detailed behaviour of the HSS
When receiving an Update Location request the HSS shall check whether
subscription data exists for the IMSI.
If the HSS determines that there is not any type of subscription for the IMSI
(including EPS, GPRS and CS subscription data), a Result Code of
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be returned.
If the Update Location Request is received over the S6a interface, and the
subscriber has not any APN configuration, the HSS shall return a Result Code
of DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_EPS_SUBSCRIPTION.
If the Update Location Request is received over the S6d interface, and the
subscriber has neither an APN configuration profile nor GPRS subscription
data, the HSS shall return a Result Code of
DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_EPS_SUBSCRIPTION.
When sending DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_EPS_SUBSCRIPTION, an Error Diagnostic
information may be added to indicate whether or not GPRS subscription data are
subscribed (i.e. whether or not Network Access Mode stored in the HSS
indicates that only circuit service is allowed).
The HSS shall check whether the RAT type the UE is using is allowed. If it is
not, a Result Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_RAT_NOT_ALLOWED shall be returned.
The HSS shall check whether roaming is not allowed in the VPLMN due to ODB. If
so a Result Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED shall be returned. When
this error is sent due to the MME or SGSN not supporting a certain ODB
category, an Error Diagnostic information element may be added to indicate the
type of ODB; if this error is sent due to the ODB indicating \"Barring of
Roaming\", Error Diagnostic shall not be included.
If the Update Location Request is received over the S6a interface, the HSS
shall send a Cancel Location Request with a Cancellation-Type of
MME_UPDATE_PROCEDURE (CLR; see chapter 7.2.7) to the previous MME (if any) and
replace the stored MME-Identity with the received value (the MME-Identity is
received within the Origin-Host AVP). The HSS shall reset the \"UE purged in
MME\" flag. If the \"Single-Registration-Indication\" flag was set in the
received request, the HSS shall send a Cancel Location Request with a
Cancellation-Type of SGSN _UPDATE_PROCEDURE to the SGSN (MAP Cancel Location),
and delete the stored SGSN address and SGSN number. If the \"Initial-Attach-
Indicator\" flag was set in the received request, and the \"Single-
Registration-Indication\" flag was not set, the HSS shall send a Cancel
Location Request with a Cancellation-Type of INITIAL_ATTACH_PROCEDURE (CLR;
see chapter 7.2.7, or MAP Cancel Location) to the SGSN if there is an SGSN
registration.
If the Update Location Request is received over the S6d interface, the HSS
shall send a Cancel Location Request with a Cancellation-Type of
SGSN_UPDATE_PROCEDURE (CLR; see chapter 7.2.7, or MAP Cancel Location) to the
previous SGSN (if any) and replace the stored SGSN-Identity with the received
value (the SGSN-Identity is received within the Origin-Host AVP). The HSS
shall reset the \"UE purged in SGSN\" flag. If the \"Initial-Attach-
Indicator\" flag was set in the received request, the HSS shall send a Cancel
Location Request with a Cancellation-Type of INITIAL_ATTACH_PROCEDURE (CLR;
see chapter 7.2.7) to the MME if there is an MME registration.
When the HSS receives the Update Location Request, if a 15^th^ digit of the
IMEI AVP is received, the HSS may discard the digit.
If the Update Location Request includes the list of active APNs, the HSS shall
delete all the stored dynamic PDN GW information, if there are any, and then
replace them by the PDN GW information received in the list of Active-APN
AVPs.
If the Update Location Request includes an equivalent PLMN list, the HSS shall
return the CSG list (if any) for each equivalent PLMN to the MME with the
subscription data, and Visited-PLMN-Id AVP shall be present in the CSG-
Subscription-Data AVP to indicate the corresponding PLMN. If there is no
equivalent PLMN list received, the HSS may not include Visited-PLMN-Id AVP in
the CSG-Subscription-Data AVP, and the CSG-Subscription-Data AVP shall contain
the CSG subscription data of the registered PLMN of the MME or the SGSN.
If the Update Location Request is received over the S6a interface for a user
for which the URRP-MME parameter is set in the HSS, the HSS shall clear the
URRP-MME parameter and send an indication to the corresponding Service Related
Entities.
If the Update Location Request is received over the S6d interface for a user
for which the URRP-SGSN parameter is set in the HSS, the HSS shall clear the
URRP-SGSN parameter and send an indication to the corresponding Service
Related Entities.
If no result code has been sent to the MME or SGSN so far, the HSS shall
include the subscription data in the ULA command according to the ULR-Flags
and the supported/unsupported features of the MME or SGSN, unless an explicit
\"skip subscriber data\" indication has been received in the request, and
shall return a Result Code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
When the APN-Configuration-Profile AVP is present in the Subscription-Data AVP
sent within a ULA, the AVP shall contain at least the default APN
Configuration and a Context-Identifier AVP that identifies the per
subscriber's default APN configuration. The default APN Configuration shall
not contain the Wildcard APN (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], clause 9.2); the default
APN shall always contain an explicit APN.
The GPRS Subscription data (if available in the HSS) shall only be present in
the ULA command if it was indicated by the serving node in the ULR-Flags AVP
(see clause 7.3.7), or when the subscription data is returned by a Pre-Rel-8
HSS (via an IWF) or when the Update Location Request is received over the S6d
interface and there is no APN configuration profile stored for the subscriber.
The HSS shall use the indication received in the GPRS-Subscription-Data-
Indicator for future use in the subscriber data update procedures.
The HSS shall store the new terminal information and/or the new UE SRVCC
capability, if they are present in the request. If the UE SRVCC capability is
not present, the HSS shall store that it has no knowledge of the UE SRVCC
capability.
If the MME/SGSN indicates support of the Additional-MSISDN feature and an
additional MSISDN (A-MSISDN) is available in the subscription data, the HSS
shall send the provisioned additional MSISDN together with the MSISDN.
If the MME/SGSN does not support the Additional-MSISDN feature, the HSS shall
populate the MSISDN AVP either with the subscribed MSISDN or the subscribed
additional MSISDN based on operator policy and availability.
NOTE: When the MME/SGSN does not support the Additional-MSISDN feature, the
MME/SGSN will use the MSISDN from the MSISDN AVP as C-MSISDN.
LCS-Info, Teleservice-List and Call-Barring-Info data shall be included
according to the list of supported features indicated by the serving node (see
clause 7.3.10).
If the HSS supports the \"SMS in MME\" feature and receives the indication
that the MME supports the \"SMS in MME\" feature and requests to be registered
for SMS by including the MME Number for SMS, SMS-Register-Request AVP and/or
setting the SMS-Only-Indication flag in the ULR-Flags AVP if indicated from
the UE, the HSS shall determine if SMS can be provided via the MME as
described in 3GPP TS 23.272 [44]. If SMS in MME is accepted the HSS shall
register the MME for MT SMS, store the \"MME number for SMS\" as the
corresponding MSC number to be used for MT SMS and return an indication of MME
registered for SMS in ULA-Flags AVP.
If the MME is successfully registered for SMS the HSS shall download the
available SMS related subscription data that may comprise SMS teleservice,
MSISDN, ODB and barring services for SMS according to supported features.
If the HSS supports the \"SMS in SGSN\" feature as described in 3GPP TS 23.060
[12], clause 5.3.18 and receives the indication from the SGSN that it supports
\"SMS in SGSN\" feature, and SMS-Register-Request AVP and/or the SMS-Only-
Indication flag in the ULR-Flags AVP if indicated from the UE, and the PS
subscriber data allow for SMS services (e.g. the subscription information
indicates \"PS and SMS-Only\"), the HSS shall determine if SMS can be provided
via the SGSN as described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [12]. If \"SMS in SGSN\" is
accepted the HSS shall indicate in the ULA that \"SMS in SGSN\" is allowed to
the SGSN and shall handle MT SMS as described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [12], clause
5.3.18.
The HSS may use the indication received in the Node-Type-Indicator for future
use in the subscriber data update procedures.
Subscriber-Status AVP shall be present in the Subscription-Data AVP when sent
within a ULA. If the value \"OPERATOR_DETERMINED_BARRING\" is sent, the
Operator-Determined-Barring AVP or HPLMN-ODB AVP shall also be present in the
Subscription-Data AVP, or vice versa.
Access-Restriction-Data AVP shall be present within the Subscription-Data AVP
sent within a ULA if at least one of the defined restrictions applies.
The AMBR AVP shall be present in the Subscription-Data AVP when the APN-
Configuration-Profile AVP is sent within a ULA (as part of the Subscription-
Data AVP) and may be present in the Subscription-Data AVP when the GPRS-
Subscription-Data AVP is present.
The EPS-Subscribed-QoS-Profile AVP and the AMBR AVP shall be present in the
APN-Configuration AVP when the APN-Configuration AVP is sent in the APN-
Configuration-Profile AVP and when the APN-Configuration-Profile AVP is sent
within a ULA (as part of the Subscription-Data AVP).
For those APNs that have been authorized as a consequence of having the
Wildcard APN in the user subscription, the HSS shall include the specific APN
name and associated PDN-GW identity inside the APN context of the Wildcard
APN. This indicates to the MME that the particular APN shall not be cached in
the MME and it shall be deleted when the UE session is terminated.
If a Result Code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS is returned, the HSS shall set the
Separation Indication in the response.
If the HSS receives an indication in the ULR command about the homogeneous
support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions in all TA/RAs associated to a serving
node, it may use this information in the future in order to skip the T-ADS
data retrieval, as described in clause 5.2.2.1 (IDR/IDA commands).
Subscribed-VSRVCC AVP shall be present within the Subscription-Data AVP sent
within a ULA only if the user is subscribed to the SRVCC and vSRVCC.
#### 5.2.1.2 Cancel Location
##### 5.2.1.2.1 General
The Cancel Location Procedure shall be used between the HSS and the MME and
between the HSS and the SGSN to delete a subscriber record from the MME or
SGSN. The procedure shall be invoked by the HSS and is used:
\- to inform the MME or SGSN about the subscriber's subscription withdrawal or
\- to inform the MME or SGSN about an ongoing update procedure i.e. MME or
SGSN change.
\- to inform the MME or SGSN about an initial attach procedure.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Cancel-Location-Request/Answer
(CLR/CLA) in the Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5.2.1.2.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.
Table 5.2.1.2.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

##### 5.2.1.2.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving a Cancel Location request the MME or SGSN shall check whether
the IMSI is known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS is returned.
If it is known, the MME or SGSN shall check the Cancellation Type and act
accordingly. If a cancellation type of \"Initial Attach Procedure\" is
received, the MME or SGSN shall not delete the subscription data. For details
see 3GPP TS 23.401[2] and 3GPP TS 23.060[12]. If the MME receives this
cancelation type, and it is registered for SMS, it shall consider itself as
unregistered for SMS. Also in this case a result code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS is
returned.
When a UE is served by a single combined MME/SGSN for both E-UTRAN and non-E-
UTRAN access, the combined MME/SGSN shall check the Cancellation-Type. If it
indicates Subscription Withdrawal or Update Procedure_IWF, the CLR is
processed both in the MME part and in the SGSN part of the combined node. If
it indicates Initial Attach Procedure, and if the CLR-Flags AVP is received
and supported by the combined MME/SGSN, the CLR is processed only in the
affected part of the combined node as indicated by the \"S6a/S6d-Indicator\"
flag in the CLR-Flags AVP. Otherwise, the CLR is processed only in the
affected part of the combined node and subscription data are kept for the not
affected part.
##### 5.2.1.2.3 Detailed behaviour of the HSS
The HSS shall make use of this procedure when the subscriber's subscription is
withdrawn by the HSS operator and when the HSS detects that the UE has moved
to a new MME or SGSN area.
The HSS shall include a cancellation type of \"Subscription Withdrawal\" if
the subscriber's subscription is withdrawn by the operator and shall include a
cancellation type of \"MME Update Procedure\" if the UE moved to a new MME
area and shall include a cancellation type of \"SGSN Update Procedure\" if the
UE moved to a new SGSN area, and shall include a cancellation type of
\"Initial Attach Procedure\" if the cancel location is initiated due to an
Initial Attach from the UE, and shall include a CLR-Flags with the
\"S6a/S6d-Indicator\" flag indicating the affected part of the combined node
if the cancel location is to be sent to a combined MME/SGSN during initial
attach procedure.
#### 5.2.1.3 Purge UE
##### 5.2.1.3.1 General
The Purge UE Procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS and between
the SGSN and the HSS to indicate that the subscriber's profile has been
deleted from the MME or SGSN either by an MMI interaction or automatically,
e.g. because the UE has been inactive for several days.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Purge-UE-Request/Answer (PUR/PUA) in
the Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5.2.1.3.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.
Table 5.2.1.3.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

##### 5.2.1.3.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
The MME shall make use of this procedure to set the \"UE Purged in the MME\"
flag in the HSS when the subscription profile is deleted from the MME database
due to MMI interaction or after long UE inactivity.
The SGSN shall make use of this procedure to set the \"UE Purged in SGSN\"
flag in the HSS when the subscription profile is deleted from the SGSN
database due to MMI interaction or after long UE inactivity.
The combined MME/SGSN shall make use of this procedure to set the \"UE Purged
in MME\" and \"UE Purged in SGSN\" flags in the HSS when the subscription
profile is deleted from the common MME/SGSN database due to MMI interaction or
after long UE inactivity on all registered accesses. If the HSS has indicated
support for the Partial Purge feature (see clause 7.3.10), the combined
MME/SGSN may also indicate to the HSS a Purge of the UE in only one of the
serving nodes in the combined node (either in the MME or in the SGSN).
When receiving a Purge UE response from the HSS the MME shall check the Result
Code. If it indicates success, the MME shall check the PUA flag \"freeze
M-TMSI\", and if set freeze the M-TMSI i.e. block it for immediate re-use.
When receiving a Purge UE response from the HSS the SGSN shall check the
Result Code. If it indicates success, the SGSN shall check the PUA flag
\"freeze P-TMSI\", and if set freeze the P-TMSI i.e. block it for immediate
re-use.
When receiving a Purge UE response from the HSS the combined MME/SGSN shall
check the Result Code. If it indicates success, the combined MME/SGSN shall
check the PUA flag \"freeze M-TMSI\" and \"freeze P-TMSI\", and if set freeze
the M-TMSI and/or the P-TMSI i.e. block it for immediate re-use.
##### 5.2.1.3.3 Detailed behaviour of HSS
When receiving a Purge UE request the HSS shall check whether the IMSI is
known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be
returned.
If it is known, the HSS shall set the result code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and
compare the received identity in the Origin-Host with the stored MME-Identity
and with the stored SGSN-Identity.\ If the received identity matches the
stored MME-identity and the stored SGSN-Identity, then:
\- if the HSS supports the Partial Purge feature (see clause 7.3.10), and the
combined MME/SGSN indicated that the UE was purged in only one of the serving
nodes, the HSS shall set the PUA flags according to the serving node where the
purge was done (i.e., either \"freeze M-TMSI\" if the purge was done in the
MME, or \"freeze P-TMSI\" if the purge was done in the SGSN); similarly, the
HSS shall set either the \"UE purged in MME\" flag, or \"UE purged in SGSN\"
flag, accordingly;
\- if the HSS does not support the Partial Purge feature, or the combined
MME/SGSN did not indicate that the UE was purged in only one of the serving
nodes, the HSS shall set the PUA flags \"freeze M-TMSI\" and \"freeze P-TMSI\"
in the answer message and set the flag \"UE purged in MME\" and \"UE purged in
SGSN\";
If the received identity matches the stored MME-identity but not the stored
SGSN-identity, the HSS shall set the PUA flag \"freeze M-TMSI\" and clear the
PUA flag \"freeze P-TMSI\" in the answer message and set the flag \"UE purged
in MME\";\ If the received identity matches the stored SGSN-identity but not
the stored MME-identity, the HSS shall set the PUA flag \"freeze P-TMSI\" and
clear the PUA flag \"freeze M-TMSI\" in the answer message and set the flag
\"UE purged in SGSN\";\ If the received identity does not match the stored
MME-identity and does not match the stored SGSN-identity, the HSS shall clear
the PUA flags \"freeze M-TMSI\" and \"freeze P-TMSI in the answer message.
### 5.2.2 Subscriber Data Handling Procedures
#### 5.2.2.1 Insert Subscriber Data
##### 5.2.2.1.1 General
The Insert Subscriber Data Procedure shall be used between the HSS and the MME
and between the HSS and the SGSN for updating and/or requesting certain user
data in the MME or SGSN in the following situations:
\- due to administrative changes of the user data in the HSS and the user is
now located in an MME or SGSN, i.e. if the user was given a subscription and
the subscription has changed;
\- the operator has applied, changed or removed Operator Determined Barring
for this user;
\- activate subscriber tracing in the MME or the SGSN;
\- to indicate to the MME or SGSN that the HSS has requested to be notified
when the UE has become reachable;
\- to request from the MME or SGSN the necessary data to support the T-ADS
functionality;
\- to retrieve location information and/or state information from the MME or
the SGSN;
\- to retrieve from the MME or the SGSN the Local Time Zone of the location in
the visited network where the UE is attached;
\- to update the STN-SR (e.g., as a result of an Sh interaction with an SCC-
AS).
\- to update the MME/SGSN with the identity of a dynamically allocated PDN GW
as a result of the first PDN connection establishment associated with an APN
over non 3GPP access.
\- to indicate to the MME that the HSS has deregistered the MME for SMS.
If the HSS knows that the UE has attached to the same combined MME/SGSN via
both the E-UTRAN and UTRAN/GERAN, i.e. the HSS has received the Update
Location Request over both the S6a interface and S6d interface respectively
with the same SGSN number, the HSS should invoke this procedure for a single
time to update and/or request certain user data in the combined MME/SGSN, i.e.
the HSS should not invoke this procedure for each of the MME and the SGSN
registered respectively.
If the Node-Type-Indicator information has been previously received as cleared
in the ULR-Flags and if the MME has not been registered for SMS during update
location procedure for the MME, the HSS may skip any change of the SMS related
subscription data and consequently does not have to make use of the Insert
Subscriber Data procedure to update the SMS subscription data in the MME.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Insert Subscriber Data-Request/Answer
(IDR/IDA) in the Diameter application specified in clause 7.
Table 5.2.2.1.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.
Table 5.2.2.1.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

##### 5.2.2.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving an Insert Subscriber Data request the MME or SGSN shall check
whether the IMSI is known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be
returned.
If it is known, the MME or SGSN shall replace the specific part of the stored
subscription data with the received data, or shall add the received data to
the stored data.
When receiving the APN-Configuration-Profile AVP within the Subscription-Data
AVP, the MME or SGSN shall check the All-APN-Configurations-Included-Indicator
value. If it indicates \"All_APN_CONFIGURATIONS_INCLUDED\", the MME or SGSN
shall delete all stored APN-Configurations and then store all received APN-
Configurations. Otherwise, the MME or SGSN shall check the Context-Identifier
value of each received APN-Configuration. If the Context-Identifier of a
received APN-Configuration matches a Context-Identifier of a stored APN-
Configuration, the MME or SGSN shall replace the stored APN-Configuration with
the received APN-Configuration. If the Context-Identifier of a received APN-
Configuration does not match a Context-Identifier of a stored APN-
Configuration, the MME or SGSN shall add the received APN-Configuration to the
stored APN-Configurations. If the addition or update of the subscription data
succeeds in the MME or SGSN, the Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
The MME or SGSN shall then acknowledge the Insert Subscriber Data message by
returning an Insert Subscriber Data Answer.
For each of the received APN-Configurations in the APN-Configuration-Profile,
if both the MIP6-Agent-Info and the PDN-GW-Allocation-Type AVPs are absent in
the APN-Configuration AVP, the MME or SGSN shall perform the PGW selection
(static or dynamic) according to the local configuration. If MIP6-Agent-Info
is present, and PDN-GW-Allocation-Type is not present, this means that the PDN
GW address included in MIP6-Agent-Info has been statically allocated.
If the MME/SGSN supports interworking with Gn/Gp-SGSNs, it shall ensure that
the context identifier sent over GTPv1 for each of the received APN-
Configurations is within the range of 0 and 255.
NOTE: If the MME/SGSN receives from HSS a Contex-Identifier value higher than
255, how this value is mapped to a value between 0 and 255 is implementation
specific.
If the MME is requested to notify the HSS when the UE becomes reachable, the
MME shall set the URRP-MME parameter to indicate the need to inform the HSS
about UE reachability, e.g. when the next NAS activity from the UE is
detected. If the SGSN is requested to notify the HSS when the UE becomes
reachable, the SGSN shall set the URRP-SGSN parameter to indicate the need to
inform the HSS about UE reachability, e.g. when the next NAS activity from the
UE is detected.
When receiving GPRS-Subscription-Data AVP within the Subscription-Data AVP,
the SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall check the Complete-Data-List-Included-
Indicator value. If it indicates \"All_PDP_CONTEXTS_INCLUDED\", the SGSN or
combined MME/SGSN shall delete all stored PDP-Contexts and then store all
received PDP-Contexts. Otherwise, the SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall check
the Context-Identifier value of each received PDP-Context. If the Context-
Identifier of a received PDP-Context matches a Context-Identifier of a stored
PDP-Context, the SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall replace the stored PDP-
Context with the received PDP-Context. If the Context-Identifier of a received
PDP-Context does not match a Context-Identifier of a stored PDP-Context, the
SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall add the received PDP-Context to the stored
PDP-Contexts.
If the MME or SGSN receives an empty Subscription-Data AVP, it shall take no
action with regard to the stored subscription data.
When receiving HPLMN-ODB AVP within the Subscription-Data AVP, the MME or SGSN
shall replace stored HPLMN-ODB data (if any) with the received information
rather than add the received information to the stored information.
Unsupported Barring categories need not be stored.
When receiving Operator-Determined-Barring AVP within the Subscription-Data
AVP, the MME or SGSN shall replace stored ODB subscription information (if
any) with the received information rather than add the received information to
the stored information. Unsupported Barring categories need not be stored.
When receiving Access-Restriction-Data AVP within the Subscription-Data AVP,
the MME or SGSN shall replace stored information (if any) with received
information rather than add received information to stored information.
When receiving APN-OI-Replacement AVP within the Subscription-Data AVP, the
MME or SGSN shall replace the stored information (if any) with the received
information.
When receiving Regional-Subscription-Zone-Code AVP within the Subscription-
Data AVP, the MME or SGSN shall replace stored Zone Codes (if any) with the
received information rather than add the received information to the stored
information. MMEs and SGSNs that do not support regional subscription need not
store zone codes. If due to regional subscription restrictions or access
restrictions the entire SGSN area is restricted, SGSN shall report it to the
HSS by returning the \"SGSN Area Restricted\" indication within the IDA flags.
When receiving CSG-Subscription-Data AVPs within the Subscription-Data AVP the
MME or SGSN shall replace all stored information from previously received CSG-
Subscription-Data AVPs (if any) with the received information rather than add
the received information to the stored information.
When receiving Teleservice-List AVP, Call-Barring-Info, or LCS-Info AVP, the
MME or SGSN shall replace stored information (if any) with the received
information rather than add the received information to the stored
information.
When receiving the IDR-Flags with the \"T-ADS Data Request\" bit set, and the
UE is in attached state, the MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall return in
the IDA message the time stamp of the UE\'s most recent radio contact and the
associated RAT Type, and an indication of whether or not IMS Voice over PS is
supported in the current (and most recently used) TA or RA. If the UE is in
detached state, the MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall answer successfully
to the T-ADS request from HSS, but it shall not include any of the T-ADS IEs
in the response (IMS Voice over PS Sessions Supported, RAT Type and Last UE
Activity Time).
When receiving the IDR-Flags with the \"EPS User State Request\" bit and/or
\"EPS Location Information Request\" bits set the MME or SGSN shall return the
corresponding user information to the HSS. If the serving node is a combined
MME/SGSN, and the UE is attached via both E-UTRAN and UTRAN/GERAN on the same
node, the combined MME/SGSN shall provide the corresponding user information
relevant for both MME and SGSN. If the Current Location Request bit was also
set and the UE is in idle mode, then the MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN
shall page the UE in order to return the most up-to-date corresponding user
information. If the Current Location Request bit was also set and the UE
(attached via E-UTRAN) is in connected mode, then the MME or combined MME/SGSN
shall use S1AP Location Reporting Control procedure towards the eNB prior to
reporting the E-UTRAN Cell Global Identification in order to return the UE\'s
most up-to-date cell information.
When receiving the IDR-Flags with only the \"Current Location Request\" bit
set (i.e. the \"EPS Location Information Request\" bit is not set), the MME or
SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall set the Result-Code to
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
If the \"Local Time Zone Request\" bit was set the MME or SGSN if supported
shall provide the Local Time Zone corresponding to the location (e.g. TAI or
RAI) of the UE to the HSS.
If the MME or SGSN cannot fulfil the received request, e.g. due to a database
error or any of the required actions cannot be performed, it shall set the
Result-Code to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY. If subscription data are received,
the MME or SGSN shall mark the subscription record \"Subscriber to be restored
in HSS\".
If trace data are received in the subscriber data, the MME or SGSN shall start
a Trace Session. For details, see 3GPP TS 32.422 [23].
If the Ext-PDP-Type AVP is present in the PDP-Context AVP, the SGSN or
combined MME/SGSN shall ignore the value of the PDP-Type AVP.
When receiving the IDR-Flags with the bit \"Remove SMS Registration\" set, the
MME shall consider itself unregistered for SMS.
##### 5.2.2.1.3 Detailed behaviour of HSS
The HSS shall make use of this procedure to replace a specific part of the
user data stored in the MME or SGSN with the data sent, or to add a specific
part of user data to the data stored in the MME or SGSN. The HSS shall also
make use of this procedure to indicate to the MME that it is no longer
registered for SMS.
NOTE: When a Cancel Location message is required for other reasons, the use of
IDR to indicate that the MME is no longer registered for SMS is not needed
(see clause 5.2.1.2).
Subscriber-Status AVP shall be present in the Subscription-Data AVP, sent
within IDR, if the current value in the MME or SGSN needs to be changed. To
remove all Operator Determined Barring Categories the Subscriber-Status shall
be set to \"SERVICE_GRANTED\". If Subscriber-Status AVP is present and set to
OPERATOR_DETERMINED_BARRING, the Operator-Determined-Barring AVP or HPLMN-ODB
AVP shall also be present in the Subscription-Data AVP.
Access-Restriction-Data AVP shall be present within the Subscription-Data AVP
send within an IDR if the information stored in the MME or SGSN needs to be
modified.
APN-OI-Replacement AVP shall be present in the Subscription-Data AVP sent
within an IDR, if the UE level APN-OI-Replacement has been added or modified
in the HSS.
The APN-Configuration-Profile AVP shall be present in the Subscription-Data
AVP sent within an IDR if the Context-Identifier associated with the default
APN configuration is changed or at least one APN-Configuration is added or
modified by the HSS. If the default APN is changed in the HSS, the APN-
Configuration-Profile AVP shall contain the Context-Identifier associated with
the default APN and the APN-Configuration AVP for the default APN. The default
APN Configuration shall not contain the Wildcard APN (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [3],
clause 9.2); the default APN shall always contain an explicit APN.
The EPS-Subscribed-QoS-Profile AVP and the AMBR AVP shall be present in the
APN-Configuration AVP when the APN-Configuration AVP is sent in the APN-
Configuration-Profile AVP and when the APN-Configuration-Profile AVP is sent
within a IDR (as part of the Subscription-Data AVP).
If the GPRS-Subscription-Data-Indicator information has been previously
received as set in the ULR-Flags during update location procedure for the SGSN
or combined MME/SGSN, the HSS shall make use of this procedure to replace the
GPRS Subscription Data stored in the SGSN or combined MME/SGSN with the data
sent or to add a PDP-Context to the data stored in the SGSN or combined
MME/SGSN.
If the HSS receives a message (e.g. via MAP ATM or Sh Sh-Subs-Notif) from a
Service Related Entity (e.g. IP-SM-GW) indicating that the UE is unreachable,
\- the HSS shall associate the subscription to UE reachability of the service-
related entity to the URRP-MME and the URRP-SGSN parameters (if not already
done)
\- and if the URRP-MME and/or the URRP-SGSN parameters were not already set
(i.e. at least one service-related entity already listed as subscribed), the
HSS shall
\- set the URRP-MME and/or URRP-SGSN parameters and
\- send an IDR command to the registered MME and/or to the registered SGSN
including the \"UE Reachability Request flag\" in the IDR Request Flags in
order to request the MME and/or SGSN to notify the HSS when the UE becomes
reachable again, unless the HSS knows from the previous ULR command that the
registered MME and/or the registerd SGSN do not support UE reachability
notifications.
If the IDR is sent for the only purpose to request the MME and/or SGSN about
the UE reachability status notification, the Subscription-Data AVP shall be
included empty.
If the HSS has received a message from a service related entity requesting EPS
User State and/or EPS Location Information without the Serving Node Indication
IE, the HSS shall set the \"EPS User State Request\" bit and/or \"EPS Location
Information Request\" bit respectively in the IDR-Flags. The HSS may
optionally also set the \"Current Location Request\" bit along with the \"EPS
Location Information Request\" bit in the IDR-Flags, if the most up-to-date
set of information is needed, unless the HSS knows from the previous ULR
command that the registered MME and/or the registered SGSN do not support
State/Location Information retrieval. If the IDR is sent only for the purpose
of requesting the MME or the SGSN User State or Location Information, the
Subscription-Data AVP included shall be empty.
If the HSS has received a message from an AS requesting the current access
network\'s support status of \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions\", and there is no
indication about homogeneous support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions in all the
serving nodes currently registered in HSS for the UE, the HSS shall set the
\"T-ADS Data Request flag\" in the IDR Request Flags, unless the HSS knows
from the previous ULR command that the registered MME and/or the registered
SGSN do not support T-ADS data retrieval. If the IDR is sent for the only
purpose to retrieve the \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions Supported\" indication
from the MME or SGSN, the Subscription-Data AVP included shall be empty.
If the HSS has received a message from an AS requesting the Local Time Zone,
the HSS shall set the \" Local Time Zone Request\" bit in the IDR-Flags,
unless the HSS knows from the previous ULR command that the registered MME
and/or the registered SGSN do not support Local Time Zone retrieval. If the
IDR is sent only for the purpose of requesting the Local Time Zone, the
Subscription-Data AVP included shall be empty.
If the HSS received an indication in a former ULR command from the MME or SGSN
about homogeneous support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions in all TA/RAs
associated to that serving node, it may use this information to skip the
retrieval of T-ADS data. This can only be done if all the registered serving
nodes in HSS for the UE indicated in ULR the same type of homogeneous support
(i.e. both serving nodes indicated \"SUPPORTED\", or both serving nodes
indicated \"NOT_SUPPORTED\"); otherwise, the retrieval of T-ADS data shall be
done, to receive the time of the last radio contact with the UE.
All APN and PGW-ID pairs stored in the HSS not associated with an explicit APN
subscription, (i.e. the access to that APN has been authorized as a
consequence of having the Wildcard APN in the user subscription), shall be
included by the HSS inside the APN context of the Wildcard APN, as multiple
instances of the Specific-APN-Info AVP.
When receiving an Insert Subscriber Data answer with \"SGSN Area Restricted\"
the HSS shall set the SGSN area restricted flag as \"SGSN area restricted\".
Subscribed-VSRVCC AVP may be present within the Subscription-Data AVP sent
within an ISR only if the user is subscribed to the SRVCC and vSRVCC.
If the HSS determines that the MME shall be unregistered for SMS it shall set
the \"Remove SMS Registration\" bit in the IDR-Flags. If the IDR is sent for
the only purpose to indicate that the MME is no longer registered for SMS, the
Subscription-Data AVP shall be included empty.
#### 5.2.2.2 Delete Subscriber Data
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
This procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS and between the SGSN
and the HSS, to remove some data of the HSS user profile stored in the MME or
SGSN. The procedure shall be invoked by the HSS and it corresponds to the
functional level operation Delete Subscriber Data (see 3GPP TS 23.401[2]).
It shall be used to remove:
\- all or a subset of the EPS subscription data (APN Configuration Profile)
for the subscriber from the MME or SGSN;
\- the regional subscription;
\- the subscribed charging characteristics;
\- Session Transfer Number for SRVCC;
\- trace data.
If the HSS knows that the UE has attached to the same combined MME/SGSN via
both E-UTRAN and UTRAN/GERAN, i.e. the HSS has received the Update Location
Request over both the S6a interface and S6d interface respectively with the
same SGSN number, the HSS should invoke this procedure for a single time to
remove some or all data of the HSS user profile stored in the combined
MME/SGSN, i.e. not invoke this procedure for each of the MME and the SGSN
registered respectively.
If the Node-Type-Indicator information has been previously received as cleared
in the ULR-Flags and if the MME has not been registered for SMS during update
location procedure for the MME, the HSS may skip any removal of the SMS
related subscription data and consequently does not have to make use of the
Delete Subscriber Data procedure to update the SMS subscription data in the
MME.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer
(DSR/DSA) in the Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5.2.2.2.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.

##### 5.2.2.2.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving a Delete Subscriber Data request, the MME or SGSN shall check
whether the IMSI is known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be
returned.
If it is known, but the Context-Identifier is associated with the default APN
configuration, the MME shall not delete the PDN subscription context, and
return an error with a Result-Code set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
Otherwise, the MME or SGSN shall delete the corresponding data according to
the indication as sent in the request, and acknowledge the Delete Subscriber
Data message by returning a Delete Subscriber Data Answer.
If an MME receives a Delete Subscriber Data Request with the \"Complete APN
Configuration Profile Withdrawal\" bit set in the DSR-Flags AVP, it shall
return an error with a Result-Code set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
If the deletion of the subscription data succeeds in the MME or SGSN, the
Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
If the Regional Subscription is deleted from the subscription data, the SGSN
shall check for its routing areas whether they are allowed or not. If the
entire SGSN area is restricted, SGSN shall report it to the HSS by returning
the \"SGSN Area Restricted\" indication within the DSA flags.
If the EPS Subscription Data is deleted from the subscription data, the MME or
SGSN shall check whether all EPS Subscription Data for the subscriber is
deleted or if only a subset of the stored EPS Subscription Data for the
subscriber is deleted, the MME or SGSN may then deactivate the associated
affected active EPS bearers.
If the Subscribed Charging Characteristics are deleted from the subscription
data, the Gn/Gp-SGSN shall maintain the existing Subscribed Charging
Characteristics throughout the lifetime of the existing MM and PDP contexts,
see 3GPP TS 32.251 [33].
If the Subscribed Charging Characteristics are deleted from the subscription
data, the MME or S4-SGSN shall maintain the existing Subscribed Charging
Characteristics throughout the lifetime of the existing IP CAN bearer, see
3GPP TS 32.251 [33].
If the MME or SGSN cannot fulfil the received request for other reasons, e.g.
due to a database error, it shall set the Result-Code to
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY. In this case, the MME or SGSN shall mark the
subscription record \"Subscriber to be restored in HSS\".
If trace data are deleted from the subscription data, the MME or SGSN shall
deactivate the Trace Session identified by the trace reference. For details,
see 3GPP TS 32.422 [23].
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Detailed behaviour of the HSS
The HSS shall make use of this procedure to remove deleted subscription data
from the MME or SGSN.
The HSS shall make use of this procedure to remove deleted GPRS Subscription
Data from the SGSN or combined MME/SGSN if the GPRS-Subscription-Data-
Indicator information has been previously received as set in the ULR-Flags
during update location procedure for the MME.
The HSS shall not set the \"Complete APN Configuration Profile Withdrawal\"
bit in the DSR-Flags AVP when sending a Delete Subscriber Data Request to an
MME, since the default APN shall always be present in an MME.
When receiving a Delete Subscriber Data Answer with \"SGSN Area Restricted\"
the HSS shall set the SGSN area restricted flag as \"SGSN area restricted\".
### 5.2.3 Authentication Procedures
#### 5.2.3.1 Authentication Information Retrieval
##### 5.2.3.1.1 General
The Authentication Information Retrieval Procedure shall be used by the MME
and by the SGSN to request Authentication Information from the HSS.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Authentication-Information-
Request/Answer (AIR/AIA) in the Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5.2.3.1.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.
Table 5.2.3.1.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

##### 5.2.3.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
The MME or SGSN shall make use of this procedure in order to retrieve the
Authentication Vectors from the HSS.
If the MME or SGSN supports Emergency services for users in limited service
state, and the user\'s IMSI is not available from the UE, or the user\'s IMSI
is marked as unauthenticated, the MME or SGSN shall not make use of the
Authentication Information Retrieval procedure.
If the request is triggered by a synchronization failure during E-UTRAN
authentication, the MME or combined MME/SGSN shall include the Re-
Synchronization Information in the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info AVP in
the request.
If the request is triggered by a synchronization failure during UTRAN or GERAN
authentication, the SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall include the Re-
Synchronization Information in the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info
AVP in the request.
Re-Synchronization Information shall not be present in both the Requested-
EUTRAN-Authentication-Info AVP and the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-
Info AVP.
A stand alone MME shall include the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info AVP
and shall not include the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP in the
request. The Immediate-Response-Preferred AVP should be present if a EUTRAN-
Vector is needed for immediate use.
A stand alone SGSN shall not include the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info
AVP and shall include the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP in the
request. The Immediate-Response-Preferred AVP should be present if a
UTRAN/GERAN-Vector is needed for immediate use.
A combined MME/SGSN may include both the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info
AVP and the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP in the request. If
both the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info AVP and the Requested-UTRAN-
GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP are present in the request, the Immediate-
Response-Preferred AVP shall be present if the requested authentication
vectors are needed for immediate use. The content of the Immediate-Response-
Preferred AVP shall correspond to the access type which the UE is currently to
be authenticated. The Immediate-Response-Preferred AVP shall not be present in
both the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info AVP and the Requested-UTRAN-
GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP. The presence of an Immediate-Response-Preferred
AVP shall indicate that a vector is needed for immediate use.
When EUTRAN-AVs and UTRAN-AVs or GERAN-AVs are requested, presence of
Immediate-Response-Preferred AVP within the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-
Info AVP shall indicate that EUTRAN-AVs are requested for immediate use in the
MME/SGSN; presence of Immediate-Response-Preferred AVP within the Requested-
UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP shall indicate that UTRAN-AVs or GERAN-AVs
are requested for immediate use in the MME/SGSN. It may be used by the HSS to
determine the number of vectors to be obtained from the AuC and the number of
vectors downloaded to the MME or SGSN.
When receiving an Authentication Information response from the HSS, the MME or
SGSN shall check the Result Code. If it indicates success and Authentication
Information is present in the result, the MME or SGSN shall use the received
vectors. For details see 3GPP TS 33.401 [5].
If the MME or SGSN supports Emergency services for users in limited service
state, the MME or SGSN shall proceed even if the Authentication Information
Retrieval procedure has failed. In this case, the MME or SGSN shall mark the
user\'s IMSI as unauthenticated.
Vectors with lower Item Number should be used before Vectors with higher Item
Number are used in the MME or SGSN. For Vectors received within different
requests those received by the earlier request should be used before those
received by the later request.
##### 5.2.3.1.3 Detailed behaviour of the HSS
When receiving an Authentication Information request the HSS shall check
whether subscription data exists for the IMSI.
If the HSS determines that there is not any type of subscription for the IMSI
(including EPS, GPRS and CS subscription data), a result code of
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be returned.
If the subscriber has neither EPS subscription data nor GPRS subscription
data, the HSS shall return a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_
EPS_SUBSCRIPTION.
When sending DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_EPS_SUBSCRIPTION, an Error Diagnostic
information may be added to indicate whether or not GPRS subscription data are
subscribed (i.e. whether or not Network Access Mode stored in the HSS
indicates that only circuit service is allowed).
The HSS shall then request the AuC to generate the corresponding requested
Authentication Vectors (AVs). Subject to load considerations and/or other
implementation specific considerations which may be based on the presence of
an Immediate-Response-Preferred AVP, less AVs than the requested number of AVs
may be generated.
If EUTRAN-Authentication-Info is requested, when receiving AVs from the AuC,
the HSS shall generate the KASME before sending the response to the MME or
combined MME-SGSN.
If the AuC is unable to calculate any corresponding AVs due to unallowed
attachment for the UE, e.g. the UE is attaching via E-UTRAN with a SIM card
equipped, the HSS shall return an error DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED, the
HSS shall not return any AV to the requesting node in the response. Otherwise,
if no corresponding pre-computed AV is available, and the AuC is unable to
calculate any corresponding AVs due to unknown failures, such as the internal
database error, the result code shall be set to
DIAMETER_AUTHENTICATION_DATA_UNAVAILABLE. The MME or the SGSN may request
authentication vectors again.
For details see 3GPP TS 33.401 [5]. KASME generation is not performed before
sending the response to the SGSN.
If the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info AVP is present in the request, the
HSS shall download E-UTRAN authentication vectors to the MME. If the
Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP is present in the request, the
HSS shall download UTRAN or GERAN authentication vectors to the SGSN.
If the Immediate Response Preferred parameter has been received, the HSS may
use it together with the number of requested vectors and the number of vectors
stored in the HSS that are pre-computed to determine the number of vectors to
be obtained from the AuC. The HSS may return less number of vectors than
requested to the MME or SGSN. If both the Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info
AVP and the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP are in the request,
and one of them includes the Immediate Response Preferred parameter, the HSS
may omit the vectors request that are not for immediate use. If both the
Requested-EUTRAN-Authentication-Info AVP and the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-
Authentication-Info AVP are in the request, and both of them includes the
Immediate Response Preferred parameter, the HSS may return E-UTRAN
authentication vectors and UTRAN or GERAN authentication vectors. KASME is
always computed for each E-UTRAN vector due to the PLMN-binding before sending
the response to the MME independent of the presence of the Immediate Response
Preferred parameter.
If the Re-Synchronization-Info AVP has been received, the HSS shall check the
AUTS parameter before sending new authentication vectors to the MME or the
SGSN. For details see 3GPP TS 33.102 [18]. If both the Requested-EUTRAN-
Authentication-Info AVP and the Requested-UTRAN-GERAN-Authentication-Info AVP
are in the request, and both of them include the Re-Synchronization-Info AVP,
the HSS shall not check the AUTS parameter and return the result code of
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY. Any authentication vectors shall not be sent by the
HSS to the requesting node in the response.
If more than one EPS or UTRAN or GERAN Vector is to be included within one
Authentication-Info AVP, the Item-Number AVP shall be present within each
Vector.
The HSS shall then return the result code DIAMETER_SUCCESS and the generated
AVs (if any) to the MME or SGSN.
### 5.2.4 Fault Recovery Procedures
#### 5.2.4.1 Reset
##### 5.2.4.1.1 General
The Reset Procedure shall be used by the HSS, after a restart, to indicate to
the MME and to the SGSN that a failure has occurred.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Reset-Request/Answer (RSR/RSA) in the
Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5.2.4.1.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.
Table 5.2.4.1.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

##### 5.2.4.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving a Reset message the MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall mark
all impacted subscriber records \" Location Information Confirmed in HSS \" as
\"Not Confirmed\". The MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall make use of the
HSS Identity received in the Origin-Host AVP (by comparing it with the value
stored after successful ULA) and may make use of the received User-Id-List (if
any) in order to determine which subscriber records are impacted.
At the next authenticated radio contact with the UE concerned, if the
subscriber record \"Location Information Confirmed in HSS\" is marked as \"Not
Confirmed\", the restoration procedure shall be triggered.
##### 5.2.4.1.3 Detailed behaviour of the HSS
The HSS shall make use of this procedure in order to indicate to all relevant
MMEs, SGSN, and combined MME/SGSNs that the HSS has restarted and may have
lost the current MME-Identity and SGSN-Identity of some of its subscribers who
may be currently roaming in the MME area and/or SGSN area, and that the HSS,
therefore, cannot send a Cancel Location messages or Insert Subscriber Data
messages when needed.
The HSS optionally may include a list of Ids identifying a subset of
subscribers served by the HSS, if the occurred failure is limited to those
subscribers.
The HSS should invoke this procedure towards a combined MME/SGSN only for a
single time even if some of the impacted subscribers are attached to the
combined MME/SGSN via UTRAN/GERAN and some of the impacted subscribers are
attached to the combined MME/SGSN via E-UTRAN.
### 5.2.5 Notification Procedures
#### 5.2.5.1 Notification
##### 5.2.5.1.1 General
The Notification Procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS and
between the SGSN and the HSS when an inter MME or SGSN location update does
not occur but the HSS needs to be notified about
\- an update of terminal information;
\- an update of the UE SRVCC capability.
The Notification Procedure shall also be used between the MME and the HSS and
between the SGSN and the HSS if the HSS needs to be notified about:
\- an assignment/change of a dynamically allocated PDN GW for an APN, if such
a notification is needed taking into account the access restrictions;
The Notification Procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS when an
inter MME location update does not occur but the HSS needs to be notified
about
\- the need to send a Cancel Location to the current SGSN.
The Notification Procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS when the
\"SMS in MME\" feature is applied and between the SGSN and the HSS when an
earlier short message delivery failed and the HSS needs to be notified about:
\- the UE is reachable or the UE has memory capacity available to receive one
or more short messages.
The Notification Procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS and
between the SGSN and the HSS when the HSS has requested to be notified about:
\- the UE is reachable.
The Notification Procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS and
between the SGSN and the HSS to notify the HSS about:
\- an update of the Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice Over PS Sessions.
The Notification Procedure shall be used between the MME and the HSS to notify
the HSS about:
\- removal of MME registration for SMS.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Notify-Request/Answer (NOR/NOA) in
the Diameter application specified in chapter 7.

##### 5.2.5.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
If the MME or SGSN supports Emergency services, the MME or SGSN shall not make
use of the Notification procedure for emergency attached UEs.
The MME or SGSN shall include conditional AVPs in NOR according to the
description given in table 5.2.5.1.1/1.
If the MME sends a Notify Request to inform the HSS that the UE has become
reachable again, the MME shall clear the corresponding URRP-MME for the UE.
If the SGSN sends a Notify Request to inform the HSS that the UE has become
reachable again, the SGSN shall clear the corresponding URRP-SGSN for the UE.
If the MME sends a Notify Request to inform the HSS about the presence of the
UE to receive one or more short messages, the MME shall clear the
corresponding MNRF for the UE.
If the SGSN sends a Notify Request to inform the HSS about the presence of the
UE to receive one or more short messages, the SGSN shall clear the
corresponding MNRG for the UE.
If the MME or the SGSN determines that it needs to update the Homogeneous
Support of IMS Voice Over PS Sessions in the HSS, the MME or the SGSN shall
send a Notify Request with the updated Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice Over
PS Sessions to the HSS. MME or SGSN shall ensure the status of Homogeneous
Support of IMS Voice Sessions in HSS does not contradict with the value of
\"IMS voice over PS session indicator\" provided to UE over NAS as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [31] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [64];\ if \"IMS voice over PS
session indicator\" sent to UE has changed from \"not supported\" to
\"supported\" when status Homogenous Support of IMS Voice in HSS is \"not
supported\", MME or SGSN shall immediately send Notify Request indicating as
either homogenous support or not homogeneous;\ if \"IMS voice over PS session
indicator\" sent to UE has changed from \"supported\" to \"not supported\"
when status Homogenous Support of IMS Voice in HSS is \"supported\", MME or
SGSN shall immediately send Notify Request indicating as either homogenous
non-support or not homogeneous.
If the MME needs to indicate to the HSS that it is no longer registered for
SMS in the HSS, the MME shall send a Notify Request with \"Removal of MME
Registration for SMS\" flag set in the NOR-Flags AVP.
When receiving a Notify response from the HSS, if the result code indicates
DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_SERVING_NODE, the MME or SGSN shall consider the
Notification procedure as failed, and it shall mark the subscriber record as
\"Subscriber to be restored in HSS\".
##### 5.2.5.1.3 Detailed behaviour of the HSS
When receiving a Notify request the HSS shall check whether the IMSI is known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be
returned.
If the IMSI is known, and the source MME or SGSN originating the Notify
message is not currently registered in HSS for that UE, a result code of
DIAMETER_ ERROR_ UNKNOWN_SERVING_NODE shall be returned.
If the IMSI is known, and the source MME or SGSN is currently registered in
HSS, the HSS shall set the result code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS, unless otherwise
stated, and
\- store the new terminal information if present in the request;
\- store the new UE SRVCC capability if present in the request;
\- store the new PDN GW and PLMN ID for an APN if present in the request and
the APN is present in the subscription and if PDN GW is dynamically allocated;
otherwise the HSS shall not store the new PDN GW data and shall set the result
code to DIAMETER_ERROR_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY;
\- store the new PDN GW and PLMN ID, and the APN itself, if both are present
in the request, and the APN is not present in the subscription but a wild card
APN is present in the subscription;
\- mark the location area as \"restricted\" if so indicated in the request;
\- send Cancel Location to the current SGSN if so indicated in the request;
\- if the UE has become reachable again, and NOR is received on S6a from an
MME or on S6d from an SGSN, the HSS shall respectively clear the URRP-MME or
the URPP-SGSN parameter for the UE and send an indication t of UE reachability
from MME or SGSN o the Service Related Entities if there is any;
\- when NOR is received on S6d from an SGSN (with the Alert Reason present),
the HSS shall reset the MNRG flag and send a MAP-Alert-Service-Centre message,
i.e. the behaviour in the HSS should be the same as when a MAP-Ready for SM is
received from an SGSN;
\- when NOR is received on S6a from an MME (with the Alert Reason present),
the HSS shall reset the MNRF flag and send a MAP-Alert-Service-Centre message,
i.e. the behaviour in the HSS should be the same as when a MAP-Ready for SM is
received from a VLR/MSC;
\- when NOR is received on S6a from an MME or on S6d from an SGSN to update
the Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice Over PS Sessions, the HSS shall store the
updated Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice Over PS Sessions and may use this
information in the future in order to skip the T-ADS data retrieval, as
described in clause 5.2.2.1 (IDR/IDA commands). If the \"Homogeneous Support
of IMS Voice Over PS Sessions\" bit is set in the NOR-Flags AVP received but
without Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP present in the
NOR message, the HSS shall take the Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice Over PS
Sessions as unknown to the serving node.
\- when NOR is received on S6a from an MME for removal of MME registration for
SMS, the HSS shall remove the MME registration for SMS and the \"MME number
for SMS\" as the corresponding MSC number to be used for MT SMS.
and then send the response to the MME or SGSN.
# 5A MME -- CSS (S7a) and SGSN -- CSS (S7d)
## 5A.1 Introduction
The S7a interface enables the transfer of subscriber related CSG data in the
VPLMN between the MME and the CSS as described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2].
The S7d interface enables the transfer of subscriber related CSG data in the
VPLMN between the SGSN and the CSS as described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [12].
## 5A.2 Mobility Services
### 5A.2.1 Location Management Procedures
#### 5A.2.1.1 Update VCSG Location
##### 5A.2.1.1.1 General
The Update VCSG Location Procedure shall be used between the MME and the CSS
or between the SGSN and the CSS to update location information in the CSS or
retrieve the CSG subscription data of the UE from the CSS. The procedure
allows:
\- to inform the CSS about the identity of the MME or SGSN currently serving
the user,
\- to update MME or SGSN with user CSG subscription data received from the
CSS.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Update-VCSG-Location-Request/Answer
(UVR/UVA) in the Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5A.2.1.1.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the
request.
Table 5A.2.1.1.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

See | | | | | 7.3.X for the | | | | | meaning of the | | | | | bits. | +-------------------+-------------------+------+-------------------+
##### 5A.2.1.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
The MME or SGSN shall make use of this procedure to register the UE in the CSS
and to retrieve the \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" when:
\- the VPLMN supports Autonomous CSG Roaming
\- and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming in the VPLMN
\- and the UE has requested an initial attach or a tracking area procedure or
a routing area procedure to a CSG cell
\- and the MME or SGSN have not yet registered the UE in the CSS.
If the Autonomous CSG Roaming in the VPLMN is not supported or is not allowed
by the HPLMN of the subscriber, the MME or SGSN shall not make use of the
Update CSG Location procedure.
For UEs receiving emergency services, in which the UE was not successfully
authenticated, the MME or SGSN shall not make use of the Update VCSG Location
procedure.
A combined MME/SGSN shall set the \"Skip Subscriber Data\" flag in the UVR-
Flags if the \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" are already available due to a
previously VCSG Location updating.
A combined MME/SGSN that has chosen the option to include the SGSN Number
within an Update VCSG Request sent over S7a shall be prepared to receive a
single CSG subscription data update message from the CSS when the CSG
subscription data is modified in the CSS.
When receiving an Update VCSG Location Answer from the CSS, the MME or SGSN
shall check the result code. If it indicates success the MME or SGSN shall
delete all the stored \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" (if any) and then
store the received \"CSG subscription data from the CSS\" (if any), and it
shall store the CSS identity as received in the Origin-Host AVP.
If the same CSG Id exists in both \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" and \"CSG
subscription data from HSS\", the \"CSG subscription data from HSS\" shall
take precedence over the \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" in further use.
If an error response is received from the CSS, the MME or SGSN shall not
reject the UE and shall end the procedure when the UE is attaching to a normal
cell. If the UE is attaching to a CSG cell, in this case the MME or SGSN shall
check if there is such CSG Id from the HSS. If there is no such CSG Id, the
MME or SGSN shall reject the UE.
##### 5A.2.1.1.3 Detailed behaviour of the CSS
When receiving an Update VCSG Location request the CSS shall check whether the
user is known.
If the user is not known, and if the Update VCSG Location Request is received
over the S7a/S7d interface, the CSS may:
\- store the MME or SGSN identity received within the Origin-Host AVP, and
include the UVA-Flags AVP with \"Temporary Empty VPLMN CSG Subscription Data\"
flag set, and return a Result Code of DIAMETER_ SUCCESS, or
\- return a Result Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN.
NOTE: A mechanism is needed in the CSS to associate the CSG subscription data
of the user with the received IMSI.
If the Update VCSG Location Request is received over the S7a/S7d interface,
the CSS shall replace the stored MME or SGSN identity with the received value
(the identity is received within the Origin-Host AVP).
If no result code indicating an error is sent to the MME or SGSN, the CSS
shall include the VPLMN CSG subscription data in the Update VCSG Location
Answer unless an explicit \"skip subscriber data\" indication has been
received in the request, and shall return a Result Code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
#### 5A.2.1.2 Cancel VCSG Location
##### 5A.2.1.2.1 General
The Cancel VCSG Location Procedure shall be used between the CSS and the MME
and between the CSS and the SGSN. The procedure shall be invoked by the CSS
and is used:
\- to inform the MME or SGSN about the subscriber's VCSG subscription
withdrawal by the CSS operator and the removal of their registration in the
CSS.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Cancel-VCSG-Location-Request/Answer
(CVR/CVA) in the Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5A.2.1.2.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the
request.

##### 5A.2.1.2.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving a Cancel VCSG Location request the MME or SGSN shall check
whether the IMSI is known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS is returned.
If it is known, the MME or SGSN shall check if the Cancellation Type is
Subscription Withdrawal. In this case, the MME or SGSN shall remove the
information of their registration in the CSS and the stored VPLMN CSG
subscription if any. Also in this case a result code of DIAMETER_SUCCESS is
returned.
When a UE is served by a single combined MME/SGSN for both E-UTRAN and non-E-
UTRAN access, the combined MME/SGSN shall check if the Cancellation Type is
Subscription Withdrawal. In this case, the Cancel VCSG Location request is
processed both in the MME part and in the SGSN part of the combined node.
##### 5A.2.1.2.3 Detailed behaviour of the CSS
The CSS shall make use of this procedure when the user's VPLMN CSG
subscription is withdrawn by the CSS operator and shall include a cancellation
type of \"Subscription Withdrawal.
### 5A.2.2 Subscriber Data Handling Procedures
#### 5A.2.2.1 Insert VCSG Subscriber Data
##### 5A.2.2.1.1 General
The Insert VCSG Subscriber Data Procedure shall be used between the CSS and
the MME and between the CSS and the SGSN for updating CSG subscription data in
the MME or SGSN in the following situations:
\- due to administrative changes of the user data in the CSS and the user is
now located in an MME or SGSN, i.e. if the user was given a CSG subscription
and the CSG subscription has changed;
If the CSS knows that the UE has attached to the same combined MME/SGSN via
both the E-UTRAN and UTRAN/GERAN, i.e. the CSS has received the Update VCSG
Location Request over both the S7a interface and S7d interface respectively
with the same SGSN number, the CSS should invoke this procedure for a single
time to update CSG subscription data in the combined MME/SGSN, i.e. the CSS
should not invoke this procedure for each of the MME and the SGSN registered
respectively.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Insert-Subscriber Data-Request/Answer
(IDR/IDA) in the Diameter application specified in clause 7.
Table 5A.2.2.1.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the
request.
Table 5A.2.2.1.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

##### 5A.2.2.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving an Insert VCSG Subscriber Data request, the MME or SGSN shall
check whether the IMSI is known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be
returned.
If the request does not contain any CSG-Subscription-Data AVP, Experimental-
Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_SUBS_DATA_ABSENT.
If the request contains at least one CSG-Subscription-Data AVPs, the MME or
SGSN shall delete all the stored \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" (if any),
and then store the received \"CSG subscription data from CSS\".
If the MME or SGSN cannot fulfil the received request, e.g. due to a database
error, it shall set the Result-Code to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
If the same CSG Id exists in both \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" and \"CSG
subscription data from HSS\", the \"CSG subscription data from HSS\" shall
take precedence over the \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" in further use.
##### 5A.2.2.1.3 Detailed behaviour of CSS
The CSS shall make use of this procedure to delete the \"CSG subscription data
from CSS\" stored in the MME or SGSN and replace them with the CSG
subscription data sent.
If the CSS receives a Insert VCSG Subscriber Data answer with the Result Code
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN, the CSS shall clear the stored MME or SGSN
identity.
#### 5A.2.2.2 Delete VCSG Subscriber Data
##### 5A.2.2.2.1 General
This procedure shall be used between the CSS and the MME or between the CSS
and the SGSN, to remove all the \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" stored in
the MME or SGSN. The procedure shall be invoked by the CSS.
If the CSS knows that the UE has attached to the same combined MME/SGSN via
both E-UTRAN and UTRAN/GERAN, i.e. the CSS has received the Update VCSG
Location Request over both the S7a interface and S7d interface respectively
with the same SGSN number, the CSS should invoke this procedure for a single
time to remove all the \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" stored in the
combined MME/SGSN, i.e. not invoke this procedure for each of the MME and the
SGSN registered respectively.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer
(DSR/DSA) in the S7a/S7d Diameter application specified in clause 7.
Table 5A.2.2.2.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the
request.

##### 5A.2.2.2.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving a Delete VCSG Subscriber Data request, the MME or SGSN shall
check whether the IMSI is known.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be
returned.
If it is known, the MME or SGSN shall delete all the stored \"CSG subscription
data from CSS\".
If the deletion of the subscription data succeeds in the MME or SGSN, the
Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
If the MME or SGSN cannot fulfil the received request for other reasons, e.g.
due to a database error, it shall set the Result-Code to
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.
##### 5A.2.2.2.3 Detailed behaviour of the CSS
The CSS shall make use of this procedure to remove all the CSG subscription
data associated to CSS from the MME or SGSN.
NOTE: When a Delete VCSG Subscriber Data procedure occurs, the MME or SGSN
remains registered in the CSS
If the CSS receives a Delete VCSG Subscriber Data answer with the Result Code
DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN from the MME or SGSN, the CSS shall clear the
stored MME or SGSN identity.
### 5A.2.3 Fault Recovery Procedures
#### 5A.2.3.1 VCSG Reset
##### 5A.2.3.1.1 General
The VCSG Reset Procedure shall be used by the CSS, after a restart, to
indicate to the MME and to the SGSN that a failure has occurred.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Reset-Request/Answer (RSR/RSA) in the
S7a/S7d Diameter application specified in chapter 7.
Table 5A.2.3.1.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the
request.
Table 5A.2.3.1.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

##### 5A.2.3.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
When receiving a VCSG Reset message, the MME or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN, for
all roaming users for which they have a registration in CSS, shall mark
\"Location Information Confirmed in CSS\" record as \"Not Confirmed\". The MME
or SGSN or combined MME/SGSN shall make use of the CSS Identity received in
the Origin-Host AVP (by comparing it with the value stored after successful
ULA) in order to determine which user records are impacted.
When, as described in 3GPP TS 23.007 [43], an event requiring the MME or SGSN
to check the \"CSG subscription data from CSS\" occurs, and if the user record
\"Location Information Confirmed in CSS\" is marked as \"Not Confirmed\", the
restoration procedure shall be triggered.
##### 5A.2.3.1.3 Detailed behaviour of the CSS
The CSS shall make use of this procedure in order to indicate to all relevant
MMEs, SGSNs, and combined MME/SGSNs that the CSS has restarted and may have
lost the current MME-Identity and SGSN-Identity of some of its users who may
be currently roaming in the MME area and/or SGSN area, and to which the CSS,
therefore, cannot send e.g. Insert VCSG Subscriber Data messages when needed.
The CSS should invoke this procedure towards a combined MME/SGSN only for a
single time even if some of the impacted subscribers are attached to the
combined MME/SGSN via UTRAN/GERAN and some of the impacted subscribers are
attached to the combined MME/SGSN via E-UTRAN.
# 6 MME -- EIR (S13) and SGSN -- EIR (S13\')
## 6.1 Introduction
The S13 interface shall enable the ME Identity check procedure between the MME
and the EIR as described in the 3GPP TS 23.401 [2].
The S13\' interface shall enable the ME Identity check procedure between the
SGSN and the EIR as described in the 3GPP TS 23.060 [12].
## 6.2 ME Identity Check Procedures
### 6.2.1 ME Identity Check
#### 6.2.1.1 General
This Mobile Equipment Identity Check Procedure shall be used between the MME
and the EIR and between the SGSN and the EIR to check the Mobile Equipment\'s
identity status (e.g. to check that it has not been stolen, or, to verify that
it does not have faults).
This procedure is mapped to the commands ME-Identity-Check-Request/Answer
(ECR/ECA) in the Diameter application specified in chapter 6.
Table 6.2.1.1/1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.
Table 6.2.1.1/2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

#### 6.2.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the MME and the SGSN
The MME or the SGSN shall make use of this procedure to check the ME identity,
if the MME or the SGSN is configured to check the IMEI with the EIR.
IMSI may be sent together with Terminal Information to the EIR for operator-
determined purposes.
When receiving the ME Identity Check answer from the EIR, the MME or the SGSN
shall check the result code and the equipment status. Dependent upon the
result, the MME or the SGSN will decide its subsequent actions (e.g. sending
an Attach Reject if the EIR indicates that the Mobile Equipment is unknown or
blacklisted).
#### 6.2.1.3 Detailed behaviour of the EIR
When receiving an ME Identity Check request, the EIR shall check whether the
mobile equipment is known. The EIR shall identify the mobile equipment based
on the first 14 digits of the IMEI AVP.
If it is not known, a result code of DIAMETER_ERROR_ EQUIPMENT_UNKNOWN is
returned.
If it is known, the EIR shall return DIAMETER_SUCCESS with the equipment
status.
# 7 Protocol Specification and Implementation
## 7.1 Introduction
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917950 .anchor}7.1.1 Use of Diameter base protocol
The Diameter Base Protocol as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [4] shall apply
except as modified by the defined support of the methods and the defined
support of the commands and AVPs, result and error codes as specified in this
specification. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures (including error
handling and unrecognised information handling) shall be used unmodified.
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917951 .anchor}7.1.2 Securing Diameter Messages
For secure transport of Diameter messages, see 3GPP TS 33.210 [16].
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917952 .anchor}7.1.3 Accounting functionality
Accounting functionality (Accounting Session State Machine, related command
codes and AVPs) shall not be used on the S6a, S6d, S13 and S13\' interfaces.
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917953 .anchor}7.1.4 Use of sessions
Between the MME and the HSS and between the SGSN and the HSS and between the
MME and the EIR, Diameter sessions shall be implicitly terminated. An
implicitly terminated session is one for which the server does not maintain
state information. The client shall not send any re-authorization or session
termination requests to the server.
The Diameter base protocol includes the Auth-Session-State AVP as the
mechanism for the implementation of implicitly terminated sessions.
The client (server) shall include in its requests (responses) the Auth-
Session-State AVP set to the value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as described in
IETF RFC 3588 [4]. As a consequence, the server shall not maintain any state
information about this session and the client shall not send any session
termination request. Neither the Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-
Timeout AVP shall be present in requests or responses.
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917954 .anchor}7.1.5 Transport protocol
Diameter messages over the S6a, S6d, S13 and S13\' interfaces shall make use
of SCTP IETF RFC 4960 [14] .
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917955 .anchor}7.1.6 Routing considerations
This clause specifies the use of the Diameter routing AVPs Destination-Realm
and Destination-Host.
If an MME or SGSN knows the address/name of the HSS for a certain user, and
the associated home network domain name, both the Destination-Realm and
Destination-Host AVPs shall be present in the request.
If an MME or SGSN knows only the home network domain name for a certain user,
the Destination-Realm AVP shall be present and the command shall be routed to
the next Diameter node.
If an MME or SGSN knows only the identity of the user, the home network domain
name shall be derived from the user\'s IMSI (MNC and MCC values) to construct
the EPC Home Network Realm/Domain, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.003 [3], clause
19.2, and use it as Destination-Realm.
Consequently, the Destination-Host AVP is declared as optional in the ABNF for
all requests initiated by an MME or SGSN.
The address/name of the EIR shall be locally configured in the MME.
Requests initiated by the HSS towards an MME or SGSN shall include both
Destination-Host and Destination-Realm AVPs.
The HSS obtains the Destination-Host AVP to use in requests towards an MME or
SGSN, from the Origin-Host AVP received in previous requests from the MME or
SGSN.
The HSS obtains the Destination-Realm AVP to use in requests towards an MME or
SGSN, from the Origin-Realm AVP received in previous requests from the MME or
SGSN.
Destination-Realm AVP is declared as mandatory in the ABNF for all requests.
If the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID AVP is received in any of the commands,
it may be ignored by the receiving node, and it shall not be used for routing
purposes.
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917956 .anchor}7.1.7 Advertising Application Support
The HSS, MME, SGSN and EIR shall advertise support of the Diameter S6a/S6d
and/or S13/S13\' Application by including the value of the application
identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The vendor identifier value of 3GPP (10415) shall be included in the
Supported-Vendor-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands, and in the Vendor-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The Vendor-Id AVP included in Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands that is not included in the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVPs as described above shall indicate the manufacturer of the
Diameter node as per RFC 3588 [4].
[]{#__RefHeading___Toc509917957 .anchor}7.1.8 Diameter Application Identifier
This clause specifies three Diameter applications: The S6a/S6d interface
application, the S13/S13\' interface application, and the S7a/S7d interface
application.
The S6a/S6d interface application allows a Diameter server and a Diameter
client:
\- to exchange location information;
\- to authorize a user to access the EPS;
\- to exchange authentication information;
\- to download and handle changes in the subscriber data stored in the server.
The S6a/S6d interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific
Diameter application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned
by IANA to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the S6a/S6d interface
application is 16777251 (allocated by IANA).
The S13/S13\' interface application allows a Diameter server and a Diameter
client:
\- to check the validity of the ME Identity.
The S13/S13\' interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific
Diameter application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned
by IANA to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the S13/S13\' interface
application is 16777252 (allocated by IANA).
The S7a/S7d interface application allows a Diameter server and a Diameter
client:
\- to authorize a user to access CSGs identified in the CSS while roaming;
\- to download and handle changes in CSG subscriber data stored in the CSS.
The S7a/S7d interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific
Diameter application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned
by IANA to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the S7a/S7d interface
application is 16777308 (allocated by IANA).
### 7.1.9 Use of the Supported-Features AVP
When new functionality is introduced on the S6a/S6d interfaces, it should be
defined as optional. If backwards incompatible changes can not be avoided, the
new functionality shall be introduced as a new feature and support advertised
with the Supported-Features AVP. The usage of the Supported-Features AVP on
the S6a/S6d interfaces is consistent with the procedures for the dynamic
discovery of supported features as defined in clause 7.2 of 3GPP TS 29.229
[9].
When extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs
shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the
command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [9], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the all reference points as specified in this specificaion, the Supported-
Features AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by 3GPP and
hence, for features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain
the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists defined for
the reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists
from one another.
The Table 7.3.10/1 defines the features applicable to the S6a/S6d interfaces
for the feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1. The Table 7.3.10/2 defines
the features applicable to the S6a/S6d interfaces for the feature list with a
Feature-List-ID of 2.
## 7.2 Commands
### 7.2.1 Introduction
This section defines the Command code values and related ABNF for each command
described in this specification.
### 7.2.2 Command-Code values
This section defines Command-Code values for the S6a/S6d interface application
and S13/S13\' interface application as allocated by IANA in the IETF RFC 5516
[32].
Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax IETF RFC 2234 [7],
according to the rules in IETF RFC 3588 [4]. In the case, the definition and
use of an AVP is not specified in this document, the guidelines in IETF RFC
3588 [4] shall apply.
NOTE: For this release, the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID is included as an
optional AVP in all commands in order to ensure interoperability with diameter
agents following a strict implementation of IETF RFC 3588 [4], by which
messages not including this AVP will be rejected. IETF RFC 3588 [4] indicates
that the AVP shall be present in all proxiable commands, such as those
specified here, despite that the contents of this AVP are redundant since the
Application ID is already present in the command header. This AVP may be
removed in subsequent revisions of this specification, once the diameter base
protocol is updated accordingly.
The following Command Codes are defined in this specification:

## 7.3 Information Elements
### 7.3.1 General
The following table specifies the Diameter AVPs defined for the S6a/S6d
interface protocol, the S7a/S7d interface protocol and the S13/S13\' interface
protocol, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values and whether or
not the AVP may be encrypted. The Vendor-ID header of all AVPs defined in this
specification shall be set to 3GPP (10415).
For all AVPs which contain bit masks and are of the type Unsigned32, e.g.,
ULR-Flags, DSR-Flags, PUA-Flags, etc., bit 0 shall be the least significant
bit. For example, to get the value of bit 0, a bit mask of 0x0001 should be

## 7.4 Result-Code and Experimental-Result Values
### 7.4.1 General
This section defines result code values that shall be supported by all
Diameter implementations that conform to this specification.
### 7.4.2 Success
Result codes that fall within the Success category shall be used to inform a
peer that a request has been successfully completed. The Result-Code AVP
values defined in Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [4] shall be applied.
### 7.4.3 Permanent Failures
Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request has failed, and should not be attempted
again. The Result-Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588
[4] shall be applied. When one of the result codes defined here is included in
a response, it shall be inside an Experimental-Result AVP and the Result-Code
AVP shall be absent.
#### 7.4.3.1 DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN (5001)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the user identified
by the IMSI is unknown
#### 7.4.3.2 DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKNOWN_EPS_SUBSCRIPTION (5420)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that no EPS subscription
is associated with the IMSI.
#### 7.4.3.3 DIAMETER_ERROR_RAT_NOT_ALLOWED (5421)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate the RAT type the UE is
using is not allowed for the IMSI.
#### 7.4.3.4 DIAMETER_ERROR_ROAMING_NOT_ALLOWED (5004)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the subscriber is
not allowed to roam within the MME or SGSN area.
#### 7.4.3.5 DIAMETER_ERROR_EQUIPMENT_UNKNOWN (5422)
This result code shall be sent by the EIR to indicate that the mobile
equipment is not known in the EIR.
#### 7.4.3.6 DIAMETER_ERROR_UNKOWN_SERVING_NODE (5423)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that a Notify command
has been received from a serving node which is not registered in HSS as the
node currently serving the user.
### 7.4.4 Transient Failures
Result codes that fall within the transient failures category shall be used to
inform a peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was
received, but may be able to satisfy the request in the future. The Result-
Code AVP values defined in Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [4] shall be
applied. When one of the result codes defined here is included in a response,
it shall be inside an Experimental-Result AVP and the Result-Code AVP shall be
absent.
#### 7.4.4.1 DIAMETER_AUTHENTICATION_DATA_UNAVAILABLE (4181)
This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that an unexpectedly
transient failure occurs. The requesting node can try the request again in the
future.
## 8 User identity to HSS resolution
The User identity to HSS resolution mechanism enables the MME, SGSN (for non-
roaming case) or Diameter Relay/proxy agents in the home network (for roaming
case) to find the identity of the HSS that holds the subscriber data for a
given user identity when multiple and separately addressable HSSs have been
deployed in the home network. The resolution mechanism is not required in
networks that utilise a single HSS.
This User identity to HSS resolution mechanism may rely on routing
capabilitites provided by Diameter and be implemented in the home operator
network within dedicated Diameter Agents (Redirect Agents or Proxy Agents)
responsible for determining the HSS identity based on the provided user
identity. If this Diameter based implementation is selected by the Home
network operator, the principles described below shall apply.
In non-roaming case, in networks where more than one independently addressable
HSS are deployed in the home network, each MME and SGSN shall be configured
with the address/identity of a Diameter Agent (Redirect Agent or Proxy Agent)
implementing this resolution mechanism.
For support of roaming case, Diameter Relay agents and/or Diameter Proxy
agents in the home network receiving the Diameter signalling from visited
networks shall be configured with the address/identity of a Diameter Agent
(Redirect Agent or Proxy Agent) implementing this resolution mechanism.
To get the HSS identity that holds the subscriber data for a given user
identity in the home network, the Diameter request normally destined to the
HSS shall be sent to a pre-configured address/identity of a Diameter agent
supporting the User identity to HSS resolution mechanism.
\- If this Diameter request is received by a Diameter Redirect Agent, the
Diameter Redirect Agent shall determine the HSS identity based on the provided
user identity and shall return a notification of redirection towards the HSS
identity, in response to the Diameter request. Multiple HSS identities may be
included in the response, as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [4]. In such a case,
the requesting Diameter entity shall send the Diameter request to the first
HSS identity in the ordered list received in the Diameter response from the
Diameter Redirect Agent. If no successful response to the Diameter request is
received, the requesting Diameter entity shall send a Diameter request to the
next HSS identity in the ordered list. This procedure shall be repeated until
a successful response from an HSS is received. After the user identity to HSS
resolution, the MME or the SGSN shall store the determined HSS
identity/name/Realm and shall use it in further Diameter requests to the same
user identity.
\- If this Diameter request is received by a Diameter Proxy Agent, the
Diameter Proxy Agent shall determine the HSS identity based on the provided
user identity and shall forward the Diameter request directly to the HSS. In
this case, the user identity to HSS resolution decision is communicated to the
MME/SGSN in the Origin-Host/Origin-Realm AVPs of the response. The MME or the
SGSN may store the determined HSS identity/name/Realm and may use it in
further Diameter requests to the same user identity.
In roaming case, whereas a Diameter Relay Agent is stateless, a stateful
Diameter Proxy Agent in the home network may store the determined HSS
identity/name/Realm and use it in further Diameter requests associated to the
same user identity.
NOTE: Alternatives to the user identity to HSS resolution Diameter based
implementation are outside the scope of this specification.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MME mapping table for S6a and NAS Cause Code
values
When the UE initiates Attach, Tracking Area Update or Service Request, there
may be the need for the MME to communicate with the HSS via S6a to retrieve
authentication data and/or subscription data. If this retrieval is rejected by
the HSS, the received Diameter-Result-Code values or Experimental-Result
values need to be mapped to appropriate cause codes over NAS to the UE.
This mapping shall be as shown in Table A.1.
If the retrieval is successful, not needed (e.g. because data are already
available) or not possible (e.g. because HSS is unavailable), detected error
conditions need to be mapped to appropriate cause codes over NAS to the UE.
This mapping shall be as shown in Table A.2.

###### ## Annex B(normative): SGSN mapping table for S6d and NAS Cause Code
values
When the UE initiates Attach, Routing Area Update or Service Request, there
may be the need for the SGSN to communicate with the HSS via S6d to retrieve
authentication data and/or subscription data. If this retrieval is rejected by
the HSS, the received Diameter-Result-Code values or Experimental-Result
valuesneed to be mapped to appropriate cause codes over NAS to the UE.
NOTE: Mapping from MAP Gr error codes to NAS Cause Code values is described in
the 3GPP TS 29.010 [45].
This mapping shall be as shown in Table B.1.
If the retrieval is successful, not needed (e.g. because data are already
available) or not possible (e.g. because HSS is unavailable), detected error
conditions need to be mapped to appropriate cause codes over NAS to the UE.
This mapping shall be as shown in Table and B.2.
