TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
It is necessary to transfer between entities of a Public Land Mobile Network
(PLMN) information specific to the PLMN in order to deal with the specific
behaviour of roaming Mobile Stations (MS)s. The Signalling System No. 7
specified by CCITT is used to transfer this information.
The present document describes the requirements for the signalling system and
the procedures needed at the application level in order to fulfil these
signalling needs.
Clauses 1 to 6 are related to general aspects such as terminology, mobile
network configuration and other protocols required by MAP.
MAP consists of a set of MAP services that are provided to MAP service-users
by a MAP service-provider.
Figure 1.1/1: Modelling principles
Clauses 7 to 13A of the present document describe the MAP services.
Clauses 14 to 17 define the MAP protocol specification and the behaviour of
service provider (protocol elements to be used to provide MAP services,
mapping on to TC service primitives, abstract syntaxes, etc.).
Clauses 18 to 25 describe the MAP user procedures that make use of MAP
services.

# 5 Overload and compatibility overview
## 5.1 Overload control
There is a requirement for an overload/congestion control for all entities of
the Public Land Mobile Network and the underlying Signalling System No. 7.
### 5.1.1 Overload control for MSC (outside MAP)
For the entity MSC the following two procedures (outside MAP) may be applied
to control the processor load:
\- ISDN\ CCITT Recommendation Q.764 (Automatic Congestion Control), applicable
to reduce the mobile terminating traffic;
\- BSSAP\ 3GPP TS 48.008 [49] (A-interface Flow Control), applicable to reduce
the mobile originating traffic.
### 5.1.2 Overload control for MAP entities
For all MAP entities, especially the HLR, the following overload control
method is applied.
If overload of a MAP entity is detected requests for certain MAP operations
(see tables 5.1/1, 5.1/2, 5.1/3 and 5.1/4) may be ignored by the responder.
The decision as to which MAP Operations may be ignored is made by the MAP
service provider and is based upon the priority of the application context.
Since most of the affected MAP operations are supervised in the originating
entity by TC timers (medium) an additional delay effect is achieved for the
incoming traffic.
If overload levels are applicable in the Location Registers the MAP operations
should be discarded taking into account the priority of their application
context (see table 5.1/1 for HLR, table 5.1/2 for MSC/VLR, table 5.1/3 for the
SGSN and table 5.1/4 for the SMLC; the lowest priority is discarded first).
The ranking of priorities given in the tables 5.1/1, 5.1/2, 5.1/3 and 5.1/4 is
not normative. The tables can only be seen as a proposal that might be changed
due to network operator/implementation matters.

### 5.1.3 Congestion control for Signalling System No. 7
The requirements of SS7 Congestion control have to be taken into account as
far as possible.
Means that could be applied to achieve the required traffic reductions are
described in clauses 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.
## 5.2 Compatibility
### 5.2.1 General
The present document of the Mobile Application Part is designed in such a way
that an implementation which conforms to it can also conform to the Mobile
Application Part operational version 1 specifications, except on the MSC-VLR
interface.
A version negotiation mechanism based on the use of an application-context-
name is used to negotiate the protocol version used between two entities for
supporting a MAP-user signalling procedure.
When starting a signalling procedure, the MAP-user supplies an application-
context-name to the MAP-provider. This name refers to the set of application
layer communication capabilities required for this dialogue. This refers to
the required TC facilities (e.g. version 1 or 2) and the list of operation
packages (i.e. set of operations) from which operations can be invoked during
the dialogue.
A version one application-context-name may only be transferred to the peer
user in a MAP-U-ABORT to an entity of version two or higher (i.e. to trigger a
dialogue which involves only communication capabilities defined for MAP
operational version 1).
If the proposed application-context-name can be supported by the responding
entity the dialogue continues on this basis otherwise the dialogue is refused
and the initiating user needs to start a new dialogue, which involves another
application-context-name which requires less communication capabilities but
provides similar functionality (if possible).
When a signalling procedure can be supported by several application contexts
that differ by their version number, the MAP-User needs to select a name. It
can either select the name that corresponds to the highest version it supports
or follow a more specific strategy so that the number of protocol fallbacks
due to version compatibility problems is minimised.
### 5.2.2 Strategy for selecting the Application Context (AC) version
A method should be used to minimise the number of protocol fall-backs which
would occur sometimes if the highest supported AC-Name were always the one
selected by GSM entities when initiating a dialogue. The following method is
an example that can be used mainly at transitory phase stage when the network
is one of mixed phase entities.
#### 5.2.2.1 Proposed method
A table (table 1) may be set up by administrative action to define the highest
application context (AC) version supported by each destination; a destination
may be another node within the same or a different PLMN, or another PLMN
considered as a single entity. The destination may be defined by an E.164
number or an E.214 number derived from an IMSI or in North America (World Zone
1) by an E.164 number or an IMSI (E.212 number). The table also includes the
date when each destination is expected to be able to handle at least one AC of
the latest version of the MAP protocol. When this date is reached, the
application context supported by the node is marked as \"unknown\", which will
trigger the use of table 2.
A second table (table 2) contains an entry for each destination that has an
entry in table 1. For a given entity, the entry in table 2 may be a single
application context version or a vector of different versions applying to
different application contexts for that entity. Table 2 is managed as
described in clause 5.2.2.2.
The data for each destination will go through the following states:
a) the version shown in table 1 is \"version n-1\", where \'n\' is the highest
version existing in this specification; table 2 is not used;
b) the version shown in table 1 is \"unknown\"; table 2 is used, and
maintained as described in clause 5.2.2.2;
c) when the PLMN operator declares that an entity (single node or entire PLMN)
has been upgraded to support all the MAP version n ACs defined for the
relevant interface, the version shown in table 1 is set to \"version n\" by
administrative action; table 2 is no longer used, and the storage space may be
recovered.
#### 5.2.2.2 Managing the version look-up table
**WHEN** it receives a MAP-OPEN ind the MAP-User determines the originating
entity number either using the originating address parameter or the
originating reference parameter or retrieving it from the subscriber data
using the IMSI or the MSISDN.
**IF** the entity number is known:
**THEN**
It updates (if required) the associated list of highest supported ACs.
**ELSE**
It creates an entry for this entity and includes the received AC-name in the
list of highest supported ACs.
**WHEN** starting a procedure, the originating MAP-user looks up its version
control table.
**IF** the destination address is known and not timed-out.
**THEN**
It retrieves the appropriate AC-name and uses it
**IF** the dialogue is accepted by the peer
**THEN**
It does not modify the version control table
**ELSE** (this should never occur)
It starts a new dialogue with the common highest version supported (based on
information implicitly or explicitly provided by the peer).
It replaces the old AC-name by the new one in the list of associated highest
AC supported.
**ELSE**
It uses the AC-name that corresponds to the highest version it supports.
**IF** the dialogue is accepted by the peer.
**THEN**
It adds the destination node in its version control table and includes the AC-
Name in the list of associated highest AC supported.
**ELSE**
It starts a new dialogue with the common highest version supported (based on
information implicitly or explicitly provided by the peer).
**IF** the destination node was not known
**THEN**
It adds the destination node in its version control table and includes the new
AC-Name in the list of associated highest AC supported.
**ELSE**
It replaces the old AC-name by the new one in the list of highest supported AC
and reset the timer.
#### 5.2.2.3 Optimising the method
A table look-up may be avoided in some cases if both the HLR and the VLR or
both the HLR and the SGSN store for each subscriber the version of the AC-name
used at location updating. Then:
\- for procedures which make use of the same application-context, the same AC-
name (thus the same version) can be selected (without any table look-up) when
the procedure is triggered;
\- for procedures which make use of a different application-context but which
includes one of the packages used by the location updating AC, the same
version can be selected (without any table look-up) when the procedure is
triggered;
**for HLR:**
\- Subscriber data modification (stand alone);
**for VLR:**
\- Data Restoration.
# 6 Requirements concerning the use of SCCP and TC
## 6.1 Use of SCCP
The Mobile Application Part (MAP) makes use of the services offered by the
Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP).
MAP supports the following SCCP versions:
  * Signalling Connection Control Part, Signalling System no. 7 CCITT > ('Blue Book SCCP');
  * Signalling Connection Control Part, Signalling System no. 7 ITU-T > Recommendation (07/96) Q.711 to Q.716 ('White Book SCCP'). Support > of White Book SCCP at the receiving side shall be mandated from > 00:01hrs, 1st July 2002(UTC). However, for signalling over the MAP > E-interface to support inter-MSC handover/relocation, the support > of White Book SCCP shall be mandated with immediate effect.
A White Book SCCP message will fail if any signalling point used in the
transfer of the message does not support White Book SCCP. Therefore it is
recommended that the originator of the White Book SCCP message supports a drop
back mechanism or route capability determination mechanism to interwork with
signalling points that are beyond the control of GSM/UMTS network operators.
In North America (World Zone 1) the national version of SCCP is used as
specified in ANSI T1.112. Interworking between a PLMN in North America and a
PLMN outside North America will involve an STP to translate between ANSI SCCP
and ITU-T/CCITT SCCP.
The SCCP is identified as an MTP3-user and the transport of SCCP messages
between two entities shall be accomplished according to the 3GPP TS 29.202
[121].
### 6.1.1 SCCP Class
MAP will only make use of the connectionless classes (0 or 1) of the SCCP.
### 6.1.2 Sub-System Number (SSN)
The Application Entities (AEs) defined for MAP consist of several Application
Service Elements (ASEs) and are addressed by sub-system numbers (SSNs). The
SSNs for MAP are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [17].
When the SGSN emulates MSC behaviour for processing messages (MAP-MO-FORWARD-
SHORT-MESSAGE, MAP_CHECK_IMEI, MAP_SUBSCRIBER_LOCATION_REPORT) towards
entities which do not support interworking to SGSNs, it shall use the MSC SSN
in the calling party address instead of the SGSN SSN.
When present in the network, the Presence Network Agent emulates the behaviour
of the GSM Service Control Function (gsm SCF) for processing of messages (MAP-
NOTE-MM-EVENT, MAP-ANY-TIME-INTERROGATION and MAP-ANY-TIME-MODIFICATION).
When a FFN (Follow Me Functional Node, see TS 23.094 [129]) is implemented in
a network entity different from HLR, this network entity shall emulate HLR
behaviour, i.e. it shall accept MAP-PROCESS-UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST messages
addressed with SSN for HLR.
In an EPS, an Interworking Function (IWF) may be used to convert Diameter S6a
messages to MAP Gr messages and vice versa; also an IWF may be used to convert
Diameter S13 messages to MAP Gf messages and vice versa. An SSN value for the
IWF does not exist. Instead the IWF shall use the SGSN SSN value when serving
an MME and use the HLR SSN when serving an HSS. An IWF is said to serve an MME
(or HSS) when Diameter messages are exchanged between the IWF and the MME (or
HSS).
### 6.1.3 SCCP addressing
#### 6.1.3.1 Introduction
Within the GSM System there will be a need to communicate between entities
within the same PLMN and in different PLMNs. Using the Mobile Application Part
(MAP) for this function implies the use of Transaction Capabilities (TC) and
the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of CCITT Signalling System No.
7.
Only the entities that should be addressed are described below. If the CCITT
or ITU-T SCCP is used, the format and coding of address parameters carried by
the SCCP for that purpose shall comply with CCITT Recommendation Q.713 with
the following restrictions:
1) Intra-PLMN addressing
For communication between entities within the same PLMN, a MAP SSN shall
always be included in the called and calling party addresses. All other
aspects of SCCP addressing are network specific.
2) Inter-PLMN addressing
a) Called Party Address
\- SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSN always included);
\- Global title indicator = 0100 (Global title includes translation type,
numbering plan, encoding scheme and nature of address indicator);
\- the translation type field will be coded \"00000000\" (Not used). For call
related messages for non-optimal routed calls (as described in 3GPP TS 23.066
[108]) directed to another PLMN the translation type field may be coded
\"10000000\" (CRMNP);
\- Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on global title);
b) Calling Party Address
\- SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSNs always included);
\- Point code indicator = 0;
\- Global title indicator = 0100 (Global title includes translation type,
numbering plan, encoding scheme and nature of address indicator);
\- Numbering Plan = 0001 (ISDN Numbering Plan, E.164; In Case of Inter-PLMN
Signalling, the dialogue initiating entity and dialogue responding entity
shall always include its own E.164 Global Title as Calling Party Address);
\- the translation type field will be coded \"00000000\" (Not used);
\- Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on Global Title).
If ANSI T1.112 SCCP is used, the format and coding of address parameters
carried by the SCCP for that purpose shall comply with ANSI specification
T1.112 with the following restrictions:
1) Intra-PLMN addressing
For communication between entities within the same PLMN, a MAP SSN shall
always be included in the called and calling party addresses. All other
aspects of SCCP addressing are network specific.
2) Inter-PLMN addressing
a) Called Party Address
\- SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSN always included);
\- Global title indicator = 0010 (Global title includes translation type);
\- the Translation Type (TT) field will be coded as follows:
TT = 9, if IMSI is included;
TT = 14, if MSISDN is included;
Or TT = 10, if Network Element is included. (If TT=10, then Number Portability
GTT is not invoked, if TT=14, then Number Portability GTT may be invoked).
\- Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on global title);
b) Calling Party Address
\- SSN indicator = 1 (MAP SSNs always included);
\- Point code indicator = 0;
\- Global Title indicator = 0010 (Global title includes translation type);
TT = 9, if IMSI is included;
TT = 14, if MSISDN is included;
Or TT = 10, if Network Element is included. (If TT=10, then Number Portability
GTT is not invoked, if TT=14, then Number Portability GTT may be invoked).
Routing indicator = 0 (Routing on Global Title).
If a Global Title translation is required for obtaining routeing information,
one of the numbering plans E.164, E.212 and E.214 is applicable.
\- E.212 numbering plan.
When CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, an E.212 number must not be included as
Global Title in an SCCP UNITDATA message. The translation of an E.212 number
into a Mobile Global Title is applicable in a dialogue initiating VLR, SGSN or
GGSN if the routeing information towards the HLR is derived from the
subscriber\'s IMSI. In World Zone 1 when ANSI SCCP is used, the IMSI (E.212
number) is used as a Global Title to address the HLR. When an MS moves from
one VLR service area to another, the new VLR may derive the address of the
previous VLR from the Location Area Identification provided by the MS in the
location registration request. The PLMN where the previous VLR is located is
identified by the E.212 numbering plan elements of the Location Area
Identification, i.e. the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code
(MNC).
\- E.214 and E.164 numbering plans.
When CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, only address information belonging to either
E.214 or E.164 numbering plan is allowed to be included as Global Title in the
Called and Calling Party Address. In World Zone 1 when ANSI SCCP is used, the
IMSI (E.212 number) is used as a Global Title to address the HLR.
If the Calling Party Address associated with the dialogue initiating message
contains a Global Title, the sending network entity shall include its E.164
entity number.
When receiving an SCCP UNITDATA message, SCCP shall accept either of the valid
numbering plans in the Called Party Address and in the Calling Party Address.
When CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used and an N-UNITDATA-REQUEST primitive from TC
is received, SCCP shall accept an E.164 number or an E.214 number in the
Called Address and in the Calling Address. In World Zone 1 when ANSI SCCP is
used, the IMSI (E.212 number) is used instead of E.214 number.
The following clauses describe the method of SCCP addressing appropriate for
each entity both for the simple intra‑PLMN case and where an inter-PLMN
communication is required. The following entities are considered:
\- the Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC);
\- the Home location Register (HLR);
\- the Visitor Location Register (VLR);
\- the Gateway Mobile-services Switching Centre (GMSC);
\- the GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF);
\- the Interworking Mobile-services Switching Centre (IWMSC);
\- the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN);
\- the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN);
\- the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC);
\- the CSG Subscriber Server (CSS).
#### 6.1.3.2 The Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC)
There are several cases where it is necessary to address the MSC.
##### 6.1.3.2.1 MSC interaction during handover or relocation
The address is derived from the target Cell id or from the target RNC id.
##### 6.1.3.2.2 MSC for short message routing
When a short message has to be routed to an MS, the GMSC addresses the VMSC by
an MSC identity received from the HLR that complies with E.164 rules.
For MS originating short message, the IWMSC address is derived from the
Service Centre address.
##### 6.1.3.2.3 MSC for location request routing
When a location request for a particular MS needs to be sent to the MS's VMSC,
the GMLC addresses the VMSC using an E.164 address received from the MS's HLR.
##### 6.1.3.2.4 MSC for LMU Control
When a control message has to be routed to an LMU from an SMLC, the SMLC
addresses the serving MSC for the LMU using an E.164 address.
#### 6.1.3.3 The Home Location Register (HLR)
There are several cases where the HLR has to be addressed.
##### 6.1.3.3.1 During call set-up
When a call is initiated the HLR of the called mobile subscriber will be
interrogated to discover the whereabouts of the MS. The addressing required by
the SCCP will be derived from the MSISDN dialled by the calling subscriber.
The dialled number will be translated into either an SPC, in the case of
communications within a PLMN, or a Global Title if other networks are involved
(i.e. if the communication is across a PLMN boundary).
If the calling subscriber is a fixed network subscriber, the interrogation can
be initiated from the Gateway MSC of the home PLMN in the general case. If the
topology of the network allows it, the interrogation could be initiated from
any Signalling Point that has MAP capabilities, e.g. local exchange, outgoing
International Switching Centre (ISC), etc.
##### 6.1.3.3.2 Before location updating completion
When an MS registers for the first time in a VLR, the VLR has to initiate the
update location dialogue with the MS\'s HLR and a preceding dialogue for
authentication information retrieval if the authentication information must be
retrieved from the HLR. When initiating either of these dialogues, the only
data for addressing the HLR that the VLR has available is contained in the
IMSI, and addressing information for SCCP must be derived from it. When
continuing the established update location dialogue (as with any other
dialogue), the VLR must derive the routeing information towards the HLR from
the Calling Party Address received with the first responding CONTINUE message
until the dialogue terminating message is received. This means that the VLR
must be able to address the HLR based on:
\- an E.214 Mobile Global Title originally derived by the VLR from the IMSI
(when CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used), or an E.212 number originally derived from
IMSI (when ANSI SCCP is used, an IMSI); or
\- an E.164 HLR address; or
\- in the case of intra-PLMN signalling, an SPC.
When answering with Global Title to the VLR, the HLR shall insert its E.164
address in the Calling Party Address of the SCCP message containing the first
responding CONTINUE message.
If the HLR is in the same PLMN as the VLR, local translation tables may exist
to derive an SPC. For authentication information retrieval and location
updating via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network that requires the
use of CCITT or ITU-T SCCP, the Global Title must be derived from the IMSI,
using the principles contained in CCITT Recommendation E.214 and the Numbering
Plan Indicator (NPI) value referenced by the SCCP Specifications. In World
Zone 1 where the ANSI SCCP is used, IMSI (E.212 number) is used as Global
Title. A summary of the translation from the IMSI (CCITT Recommendation E.212)
to Mobile Global Title (described in CCITT Recommendation E.214) is shown
below:
\- E.212 Mobile Country Code translates to E.164 Country Code;
\- E.212 Mobile Network Code translates to E.164 National Destination Code;
\- E.212 Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) is carried unchanged
if within the E.164 number maximum length (15 digits). If the Mobile Global
Title is more than 15 digits the number is truncated to 15 by deleting the
least significant digits.
This translation will be done either at the application or at SCCP level in
the VLR. The Mobile Global Title thus derived will be used to address the HLR.
If location updating is triggered by an MS that roams from one MSC Area into a
different MSC Area served by the same VLR, the VLR shall address the HLR in
the same way as if the MS registers for the first time in the VLR.
##### 6.1.3.3.3 After location updating completion
In this case, the subscriber\'s basic MSISDN has been received from the HLR
during the subscriber data retrieval procedure as well as the HLR number
constituting a parameter of the MAP message indicating successful completion
of the update location dialogue. From either of these E.164 numbers the
address information for initiating dialogues with the roaming subscriber\'s
HLR can be derived. Also the subscriber\'s IMSI may be used for establishing
the routeing information towards the HLR. This may apply in particular if the
dialogue with the HLR is triggered by subscriber controlled input.
Thus the SCCP address of the roaming subscriber\'s HLR may be an SPC, or it
may be a Global title consisting of the E.164 MSISDN or the E.164 number
allocated to the HLR or either the E.214 Mobile Global Title derived from the
IMSI if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, or the IMSI if ANSI SCCP is used (ANSI
SCCP is used in World Zone 1).
##### 6.1.3.3.4 VLR restoration
If a roaming number is requested by the HLR for an IMSI that has no data
record in the interrogated VLR, the VLR provides the roaming number in the
dialogue terminating message. Subsequently the VLR must retrieve the
authentication data from the MS\'s HLR, if required, and must then trigger the
restore data procedure. For this purpose, the VLR has to initiate in
succession two independent dialogues with the MS\'s HLR. The MTP and SCCP
address information needed for routeing towards the HLR can be derived from
the IMSI received as a parameter of the MAP message requesting the roaming
number. In this case, the IMSI received from the HLR in the roaming number
request shall be processed in the same way as the IMSI that is received from
an MS that registers for the first time within a VLR. Alternatively to the
IMSI, the Calling Party Address associated with the roaming number request may
be used to obtain the routeing information towards the HLR.
##### 6.1.3.3.5 During Network-Requested PDP Context Activation
When receiving a PDP PDU the GGSN may interrogate the HLR of the MS for
information retrieval. When initiating such a dialogue, the only data for
addressing the HLR that the GGSN has available is contained in the IMSI, and
addressing information must be derived from it. The IMSI is obtained from the
IP address or the X.25 address in the incoming IP message by means of a
translation table. This means that the GGSN shall be able to address the HLR
based on an E.214, (if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used), or E.212 (if ANSI SCCP is
used), Mobile Global Title originally derived by the GGSN from the IMSI in the
case of inter-PLMN signalling. In the case of intra-PLMN signalling, an SPC
may also be used.
If the HLR is in the same PLMN as the GGSN, local translation tables may exist
to derive an SPC. For information retrieval via the international PSTN/ISDN
signalling network, the Global title must be derived from the IMSI, using the
principles contained in CCITT Recommendation E.214 and the Numbering Plan
Indicator (NPI) value referenced by the SCCP Specifications. A summary of the
translation from the IMSI (CCITT Recommendation E.212) to Mobile Global Title
(described in CCITT Recommendation E.214) is shown below:
\- E.212 Mobile Country Code translates to E.164 Country Code;
\- E.212 Mobile Network Code translates to E.164 National Destination Code;
\- E.212 Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) is carried unchanged
if within the E.164 number maximum length (15 digits). If the Mobile Global
Title is more than 15 digits the number is truncated to 15 by deleting the
least significant digits.
This translation will be done either at the application or at SCCP level in
the GGSN. The Mobile Global Title thus derived will be used to address the
HLR.
##### 6.1.3.3.6 Before GPRS location updating completion
When an MS registers for the first time in an SGSN, the SGSN has to initiate
the update location dialogue with the MS\'s HLR and a preceding dialogue for
authentication information retrieval if the authentication information must be
retrieved from the HLR. When initiating either of these dialogues, the only
data for addressing the HLR that the SGSN has available is contained in the
IMSI, and addressing information for SCCP must be derived from it. When
continuing the established update location dialogue (as with any other
dialogue), the SGSN must derive the routeing information towards the HLR from
the Calling Party Address received with the first responding CONTINUE message
until the dialogue terminating message is received. This means that the SGSN
must be able to address the HLR based on:
\- an E.214 (if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used) or E.212 (if ANSI SCCP is used)
Mobile Global Title originally derived by the SGSN from the IMSI; or
\- an E.164 HLR address; or
\- in the case of intra-PLMN signalling, an SPC.
If the HLR is in the same PLMN as the SGSN, local translation tables may exist
to derive an SPC. For authentication information retrieval and location
updating via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network, the Global title
must be derived from the IMSI, using the principles contained in CCITT
Recommendation E.214 and the Numbering Plan Indicator (NPI) value referenced
by the SCCP Specifications. A summary of the translation from the IMSI (CCITT
Recommendation E.212) to Mobile Global Title (described in CCITT
Recommendation E.214) is shown below:
\- E.212 Mobile Country Code translates to E.164 Country Code;
\- E.212 Mobile Network Code translates to E.164 National Destination Code;
\- E.212 Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) is carried unchanged
if within the E.164 number maximum length (15 digits). If the Mobile Global
Title is more than 15 digits the number is truncated to 15 by deleting the
least significant digits.
This translation will be done either at the application or at SCCP level in
the SGSN. The Mobile Global Title thus derived will be used to address the
HLR.
##### 6.1.3.3.7 After GPRS location updating completion
In this case, the subscriber\'s Basic MSISDN has been received from the HLR
during the subscriber data retrieval procedure as well as the HLR number
constituting a parameter of the MAP message indicating successful completion
of the update location dialogue. From either of these E.164 numbers the
address information for initiating dialogues with the roaming subscriber\'s
HLR can be derived. Also the subscriber\'s IMSI may be used for establishing
the routeing information towards the HLR.
Thus the SCCP address of the roaming subscriber\'s HLR may be an SPC, or it
may be a Global title consisting of the E.164 MSISDN or the E.164 number
allocated to the HLR or the E.214 Mobile Global Title derived from the IMSI.
##### 6.1.3.3.8 Query for a Location Request
For a location request from an external client, the GMLC needs to address the
home HLR of the target MS to obtain the address of the target MS's serving
MSC. The GMLC uses either the international E.164 MSISDN, the international
E.214 number (if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used) or the international E.212
number (if ANSI SCCP is used) of the MS as means to route a query to the HLR.
#### 6.1.3.4 The Visitor Location Register (VLR)
##### 6.1.3.4.0 General
There are several cases when the VLR needs to be addressed.
##### 6.1.3.4.1 Inter-VLR information retrieval
When an MS moves from one VLR service area to another, the new VLR may request
the IMSI and authentication sets from the previous VLR. The new VLR derives
the address of the previous VLR from the Location Area Identification provided
by the MS in the location registration request.
##### 6.1.3.4.2 HLR request
The HLR will only request information from a VLR if it is aware that one of
its subscribers is in the VLR service area. This means that a location
updating dialogue initiated by the VLR has been successfully completed, i.e.
the HLR has indicated successful completion of the update location procedure
to the VLR.
When initiating dialogues towards the VLR after successful completion of
location updating, the routeing information used by the HLR is derived from
the E.164 VLR number received as a parameter of the MAP message initiating the
update location dialogue. If the VLR is in the same PLMN as the HLR, the VLR
may be addressed directly by an SPC derived from the E.164 VLR number. For
dialogues via the international PSTN/ISDN signalling network, presence of the
E.164 VLR number in the Called Party Address is required.
##### 6.1.3.4.3 CSS request
The CSS will only request information from a VLR if it is aware that one of
its subscribers is in the VLR service area. This means that a VCSG location
updating dialogue initiated by the VLR has been successfully completed, i.e.
the CSS has indicated successful completion of the update VCSG location
procedure to the VLR.
When initiating dialogues towards the VLR after successful completion of VCSG
location updating, the routeing information used by the CSS is derived from
the E.164 VLR number received as a parameter of the MAP message initiating the
update VCSG location dialogue. The VLR may be addressed either by the E.164
VLR number or directly by an SPC derived from the E.164 VLR number due to the
VLR is in the same PLMN as the CSS.
#### 6.1.3.5 The Interworking MSC (IWMSC) for Short Message Service
The IWMSC is the interface between the mobile network and the network to
access to the Short Message Service Centre. This exchange has an E.164 address
known in the SGSN or in the MSC.
#### 6.1.3.6 The Equipment Identity Register (EIR)
The EIR address is either unique or could be derived from the IMEI. The type
of address is not defined.
#### 6.1.3.7 Void
#### 6.1.3.8 The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)
##### 6.1.3.8.0 General
There are several cases when the SGSN needs to be addressed.
##### 6.1.3.8.1 HLR request
The HLR will initiate dialogues towards the SGSN if it is aware that one of
its subscribers is in the SGSN serving area. This means that a GPRS location
updating has been successfully completed, i.e., the HLR has indicated
successful completion of the GPRS location update to the SGSN. The routeing
information used by the HLR is derived form the E.164 SGSN number received as
parameter of the MAP message initiating the GPRS update location procedure. If
the SGSN is in the same PLMN as the HLR, the SGSN may be addressed directly by
an SPC derived from the E.164 SGSN number. For dialogues via the international
PSTN/ISDN signalling network, the presence of the E.164 SGSN number in the
Called Party Address is required.
##### 6.1.3.8.2 GMSC request
When the GMSC initiates dialogues towards the SGSN the SGSN (MAP) SSN (See
3GPP TS 23.003 [17]) shall be included in the called party address. The
routeing information used by the GMSC is derived from the E.164 SGSN number
received as a parameter of the MAP message initiating the forward short
message procedure. If the GMSC does not support the GPRS functionality the MSC
(MAP) SSN value shall be included in the called party address.
NOTE: Every VMSC and SGSN shall have uniquely identifiable application using
E.164 numbers, for the purpose of SMS over GPRS when the GMSC does not support
the GPRS functionality.
##### 6.1.3.8.3 CSS request
The CSS will initiate dialogues towards the SGSN if it is aware that one of
its subscribers is in the SGSN serving area. This means that a VCSG location
updating has been successfully completed, i.e., the CSS has indicated
successful completion of the VCSG location update to the SGSN. The routeing
information used by the CSS is derived from the E.164 SGSN number received as
parameter of the MAP message initiating the update VCSG location procedure.
The SGSN may be addressed either by the E.164 SGSN number or directly by an
SPC derived from the E.164 SGSN number due to the SGSN is in the same PLMN as
the CSS.
#### 6.1.3.9 The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)
The GGSN provides interworking with external packet-switched networks, network
screens and routing of the Network-Requested PDP Context activation. If a
Network-Requested PDP Context activation fails, the HLR will alert the GGSN
when the subscriber becomes reachable. The HLR will use the E.164 GGSN number
received as parameter of the MAP message reporting the failure.
#### 6.1.3.10 The Gateway MSC (GMSC) for Short Message Service
The GMSC provides interworking with the network to access the Short Message
Service Centre, the mobile network and routing of Send Routing Info For SM.
The GMSC has on E.164 address known in the HLR, SGSN or MSC.
#### 6.1.3.10A Void
##### 6.1.3.10A.1 Void
##### 6.1.3.10A.2 Void
#### 6.1.3.10B The Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC)
The GMLC initiates location requests on behalf of external clients. The E.164
address of the GMLC is provided to an HLR when the GMLC requests a serving MSC
address or SGSN address from the HLR for a target MS. The E.164 address of the
GMLC is also provided to a serving MSC or SGSN when the GMLC requests the
location of a target MS served by this MSC or SGSN.
#### 6.1.3.10C The CSG Subscriber Server (CSS)
The CSS address is either unique or could be derived from the IMSI. The type
of address is not defined.
#### 6.1.3.11 Summary table
The following tables summarise the SCCP address used for invoke operations. As
a principle, within a PLMN either an SPC or a GT may be used (network
operation option), whereas when addressing an entity outside the PLMN the GT
must be used. The address type mentioned in the table (e.g. MSISDN) is used as
GT or to derive the SPC.
For a response, the originating address passed in the invoke is used as SCCP
Called Party Address. For extra-PLMN addressing the own E.164 entity address
is used as SCCP Calling Party Address; for intra-PLMN addressing an SPC
derived from the entity number may be used instead. When using an SPC, the SPC
may be taken directly from MTP.

When continuing the established update location dialogue (as with any other dialogue) the VLR must derive the routeing information towards the HLR from the Calling Party Address received with the first responding CONTINUE message until the dialogue terminating message is received. For transactions invoked by the VLR after update location completion, the VLR may derive the information for addressing the HLR from addresses received in the course of the update location procedure (MSISDN or HLR number) or from the IMSI. When invoking the Restore Data procedure and an authentication information retrieval from the HLR preceding it, the VLR must derive the information for addressing the HLR from the address information received in association with the roaming number request. This may be either the IMSI received as a parameter of the MAP message requesting the Roaming Number or the Calling Party Address associated with the MAP message requesting the Roaming Number. The gsmSCF shall be addressed using more than one Global Title number. The first Global Title number is used to address a gsmSCF for MAP. The second Global Title number is used to address a gsmSCF for CAP. For querying the HLR to obtain the VMSC address to support location services, the GMLC has to derive the HLR address from either the MSISDN or IMSI of the target MS. When using the IMSI, the result can be an SPC or an E.214 Mobile Global Title if CCITT or ITU-T SCCP is used, or IMSI itself if ANSI SCCP is used (ANSI SCCP is used in World Zone 1). |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## 6.2 Use of TC
The Mobile Application part makes use of the services offered by the
Transaction Capabilities (TC) of Signalling System No. 7. ETS 300 287, which
is based on CCITT White Book Recommendations Q.771 to Q.775, should be
consulted for the full specification of TC.
The MAP uses all the services provided by TC except the ones related to the
unstructured dialogue facility.
From a modelling perspective, the MAP is viewed as a single Application
Service Element. Further structuring of it is for further study.
Transaction Capabilities refers to a protocol structure above the network
layer interface (i.e., the SCCP service interface) up to the application layer
including common application service elements but not the specific application
service elements using them.
TC is structured as a Component sub-layer above a Transaction sub-layer.
The Component sub-layer provides two types of application services: services
for the control of end-to-end dialogues and services for Remote Operation
handling. These services are accessed using the TC-Dialogue handling
primitives and TC-Component handling primitives respectively.
Services for dialogue control include the ability to exchange information
related to application-context negotiation as well as initialisation data.
Services for Remote Operation handling provide for the exchange of protocol
data units invoking tasks (operations), and reporting their outcomes (results
or errors) plus any non-application-specific protocol errors detected by the
component sub-layer. The reporting of application-specific protocol errors by
the TC user, as distinct from application process errors, is also provided.
The Transaction sub-layer provides a simple end-to-end connection association
service over which several related protocol data units (i.e. built by the
Component Sub-Layer) can be exchanged. A Transaction termination can be
prearranged (no indication provided to the TC user) or basic (indication
provided).
# 7 General on MAP services
## 7.1 Terminology and definitions
The term service is used in clauses 7 to 12 as defined in CCITT Recommendation
X.200. The service definition conventions of CCITT Recommendation X.210 are
also used.
MAP services that are defined for use between HLR and SGSN are also used in an
Evolved Packet System (EPS) between two IWFs and between HSS and IWF, where
the IWF is an Interworking Function that converts MAP messages to Diameter
messages and vice versa.
MAP services that are defined for use between SGSN and EIR are also used in an
Evolved Packet System (EPS) between IWF and EIR.
IWFs may be connected via Diameter to MMEs and HSSs and they may be connected
via MAP to HSSs, IWFs, and EIRs.
## 7.2 Modelling principles
MAP provides its users with a specified set of services and can be viewed by
its users as a \"black box\" or abstract machine representing the MAP service-
provider. The service interface can then be depicted as shown in figure 7.2/1.
Figure 7.2/1: Modelling principles
The MAP service-users interact with the MAP service-provider by issuing or
receiving MAP service-primitives at the service interface.
A MAP service-user may receive services from several instances of the MAP
service-provider at the same time. In such cases the overall procedure is
synchronised by the service-user.
The MAP service-primitives are named using the following notation:
MAP-ServicePrimitiveName **type**
where **[type]{.underline}** can be any of: request (req), indication (ind),
response (rsp) or confirm (cnf). (In the user arrow diagrams type is not
indicated in the case of req/ind and indicated as \"ack\" in the case of
rsp/cnf).
The services are further classified as unconfirmed-service, confirmed-service
and provider-initiated-service where the first two categories refer to whether
or not the service is confirmed by the service-provider. The confirmation may
or may not correspond to a response provided by the other service-user.
MAP services are also classified as common MAP services that are available to
all MAP service-users, and MAP service-user specific services, which are
services available to one or several, but not all, MAP service-users.
A MAP dialogue is defined as an exchange of information between two MAP users
in order to perform a common task. A MAP dialogue will consist of one or
several MAP services.
## 7.3 Common MAP services
All MAP service-users require access to services for performing basic
application layer functions:
\- for establishing and clearing MAP dialogues between peer MAP service-users;
\- for accessing functions supported by layers below the applications layer;
\- for reporting abnormal situations;
\- for handling of different MAP versions;
\- for testing whether or not a persistent MAP dialogue is still active at
each side.
For these purposes the following common services are defined:
\- MAP-OPEN service;
\- MAP-CLOSE service;
\- MAP-DELIMITER service;
\- MAP-U-ABORT service;
\- MAP-P-ABORT service;
\- MAP-NOTICE service.
In defining the service-primitives the following convention is used for
categorising parameters:
> M the inclusion of the parameter is mandatory. The M category can be used
> for any primitive type and specifies that the corresponding parameter must
> be present in the indicated primitive type;
>
> O the inclusion of the parameter is a service-provider option. The O
> category can be used in indication and confirm type primitives and is used
> for parameters that may optionally be included by the service-provider;
>
> U the inclusion of the parameter is a service-user option. The U category
> can be used in request and response type primitives. The inclusion of the
> corresponding parameter is the choice of the service-user;
>
> C the inclusion of the parameter is conditional. The C category can be used
> for the following purposes:
>
> \- to indicate that if the parameter is received from another entity it must
> be included for the service being considered;
>
> \- to indicate that the service user must decide whether to include the
> parameter, based on the context on which the service is used;
>
> \- to indicate that one of a number of mutually exclusive parameters must be
> included (e.g. parameters indicating a positive result versus parameters
> indicating a negative result);
>
> \- to indicate that a service user optional parameter (marked \"U\") or a
> conditional parameter (marked \"C\") presented by the service user in a
> request or response type primitive is to be presented to the service user in
> the corresponding indication or confirm type primitive;
>
> (=) when appended to one of the above, this symbol means that the parameter
> takes the same value as the parameter appearing immediately to its left;
>
> blank the parameter is not present.
A primitive type may also be without parameters, i.e. no parameter is required
with the primitive type; in this case the corresponding column of the table is
empty.

### 7.3.6 MAP-NOTICE service
This service is used to notify the MAP service-user about protocol problems
related to a MAP dialogue not affecting the state of the protocol machines.
The service is a provider-initiated service with service-primitive as shown in
table 7.3/10.
Table 7.3/10: Service-primitive for the MAP-NOTICE service
* * *
Parameters Indication Problem diagnostic M
* * *
[Problem diagnostic]{.underline}:
This parameter can take one of the following values:
\- abnormal event detected by the peer;
\- response rejected by the peer;
\- abnormal event received from the peer;
\- message cannot be delivered to the peer.
### 7.3.7 Void
### 7.3.8 Void
### 7.3.9 Void
### 7.3.10 Void
## 7.4 Sequencing of services
The sequencing of services is shown in figure 7.4/1 and is as follows:
[Opening]{.underline}:
The MAP-OPEN service is invoked before any user specific service-primitive is
accepted. The sequence may contain none, one or several user specific service-
primitives. If no user specific service-primitive is contained between the
MAP-OPEN and the MAP-DELIMITER primitives, then this will correspond to
sending an empty Begin message in TC. If more than one user specific service-
primitive is included, all are to be sent in the same Begin message. The
sequence ends with a MAP-DELIMITER primitive.
[Continuing]{.underline}:
This sequence may not be present in some MAP dialogues. If it is present, it
ends with a MAP-DELIMITER primitive. If more than one user specific service-
primitive is included, all are to be included in the same Continue message.
[Closing]{.underline}:
The sequence can only appear after an opening sequence or a continuing
sequence. The sequence may contain none, one or several user specific service-
primitives if the MAP-CLOSE primitive specifies normal release. If no user
specific service-primitive is included, then this will correspond to sending
an empty End message in TC. If more than one user specific service-primitive
is included, all are to be sent in the same End message. If prearranged end is
specified, the sequence cannot contain any user specific service-primitive.
The MAP-CLOSE primitive must be sent after all user specific service-
primitives have been delivered to the MAP service-provider.
[Aborting]{.underline}:
A MAP service-user can issue a MAP-U-ABORT primitive at any time after the MAP
dialogue has been opened or as a response to an attempt to open a MAP
dialogue.
The MAP service-provider may issue at any time a MAP-P-ABORT primitive towards
a MAP service-user for which a MAP dialogue exists.
MAP-U-ABORT primitives and MAP-P-ABORT primitives terminate the MAP dialogue.
a) Opening
b) Continuing
c) Closing
d) Aborting
Figure 7.4/1: Sequencing of services
If the reason \"resource unavailable (short term problem)\" is indicated in
the MAP-U-ABORT indication primitive, the MAP service-user may decide to
attempt a new MAP dialogue establishment immediately.
Sequencing of user specific service-primitives is done by the MAP service-user
and based on rules applicable for each MAP service-user instance.
A MAP-NOTICE indication primitive may be received at any time during the
active period of a MAP dialogue.
## 7.5 General rules for mapping of services onto TC
### 7.5.1 Mapping of common services
Table 7.5/1 gives an overview of the mapping rules for mapping of common
services onto TC-services. Table 7.5/2 gives the mapping rules for mapping of
TC-services onto common services.
Protocol machine description is given in clauses 14 to 17.

Notes to tables 7.5/3 and 7.5/4:
NOTE 1: The mapping is determined by parameters contained in the MAP-xx
response primitive.
NOTE 2: This applies only to TC class 4 operations where the operation is used
to pass a result of another class 2 or class 4 operation.
NOTE 3: The detailed mapping rules are given in clause 16.
NOTE 4: If RESULT-NL components are present they are mapped onto the same MAP-
xx confirm.
## 7.6 Definition of parameters
### 7.6.1 Common parameters
The following set of parameters is used in several MAP service-primitives.
#### 7.6.1.1 Invoke Id
This parameter identifies corresponding service primitives. The parameter is
supplied by the MAP service-user and must be unique over each service-
user/service-provider interface.
#### 7.6.1.2 Linked Id
This parameter is used for linked services and it takes the value of the
invoke Id of the service linked to.
#### 7.6.1.3 Provider error
This parameter is used to indicate a protocol related type of error:
\- duplicated invoke Id;
\- not supported service;
\- mistyped parameter;
\- resource limitation;
\- initiating release, i.e. the peer has already initiated release of the
dialogue and the service has to be released;
\- unexpected response from the peer;
\- service completion failure;
\- no response from the peer;
\- invalid response received.
#### 7.6.1.4 User error
This parameter can take values as follows:
NOTE: The values are grouped in order to improve readability; the grouping has
no other significance.
a) Generic error:
\- system failure, i.e. a task cannot be performed because of a problem in the
entity reporting the error or in another entity. The type of entity or network
resource may be indicated by use of the network resource parameter or
additional network resource parameter. If and only if the problem is in the
entity reporting the error, a cause of failure (FailureCauseParam) shall be
included;
\- data missing, i.e. an optional parameter required by the context is
missing;
\- unexpected data value, i.e. the data type is formally correct but its value
or presence is unexpected in the current context;
\- resource limitation;
\- initiating release, i.e. the receiving entity has started the release
procedure;
> \- facility not supported, i.e. the requested facility is not supported by
> the PLMN with detailed reasons as follows:
\- Shape of location estimate not supported;
\- Needed LCS capability not supported in serving node;
\- incompatible terminal, i.e. the requested facility is not supported by the
terminal.
b) Identification or numbering problem:
\- unknown subscriber, i.e. no such subscription exists;
\- number changed, i.e. the subscription does not exist for that number any
more;
\- unknown MSC;
\- unidentified subscriber, i.e. if the subscriber is not contained in the
database and it has not or cannot be established whether or not a subscription
exists;
\- unallocated roaming number;
\- unknown equipment;
\- unknown location area.
c) Subscription problem:
\- roaming not allowed, i.e. a location updating attempt is made in an area
not covered by the subscription;
\- illegal subscriber, i.e. illegality of the access has been established by
use of authentication procedure;
\- bearer service not provisioned;
\- teleservice not provisioned;
\- illegal equipment, i.e. the IMEI check procedure has shown that the IMEI is
blacklisted or not whitelisted.
d) Handover problem:
  * no handover number available, i.e. the VLR cannot allocate a number for handover or cannot allocate the required amount of numbers for relocation;
  * subsequent handover failure, i.e. handover to a third MSC failed for some reason;
```{=html}
``` \- target cell outside group call area.
e) Operation and maintenance problem:
\- tracing buffer full, i.e. tracing cannot be performed because the tracing
capacity is exceeded.
f) Call set-up problem:
\- no roaming number available, i.e. a roaming number cannot be allocated
because all available numbers are in use;
\- absent subscriber, i.e. the subscriber has activated the detach service or
the system detects the absence condition. This error may be qualified to
indicate whether the subscriber was IMSI detached, in a restricted area or did
not respond to paging;
\- busy subscriber. This error may be qualified to indicate that the
subscriber was busy due to CCBS and that CCBS is possible;
\- no subscriber reply;
\- forwarding violation, i.e. the call has already been forwarded the maximum
number of times that is allowed;
\- CUG reject, i.e. the call does not pass a CUG check; additional information
may also be given in order to indicate rejection due to e.g. incoming call
barred or non-CUG membership;
\- call barred. Optionally, additional information may be included for
indicating either that the call meets a barring condition set by the
subscriber or that the call is barred for operator reasons. In the case of
barring of Mobile Terminating Short Message, the additional information may
indicate a barring condition due to \"Unauthorised Message Originator\"; if
the call is rejected due to the application of the ACR supplementary service,
the additional information shall indicate a barring condition due to
\"Anonymous Call Rejection\";
\- optimal routeing not allowed, i.e. the entity which sends the error does
not support optimal routeing, or the HLR will not accept an optimal routeing
interrogation from the GMSC, or the call cannot be optimally routed because it
would contravene optimal routeing constraints;
\- forwarding failed, i.e. the GMSC interrogated the HLR for forwarding
information but the HLR returned an error.
g) Supplementary services problem:
\- call barred;
\- illegal SS operation;
\- SS error status;
\- SS not available;
\- SS subscription violation;
\- SS incompatibility;
\- negative password check;
\- password registration failure;
\- Number of Password Attempts;
\- USSD Busy;
\- Unknown Alphabet;
\- short term denial;
\- long term denial.
For definition of these errors see 3GPP TS 24.080 [38].
h) Short message problem:
\- SM delivery failure with detailed reason as follows:
\- memory capacity exceeded;
\- MS protocol error;
\- MS not equipped;
\- unknown service centre (SC);
\- SC congestion;
\- invalid SME address;
\- subscriber is not an SC subscriber;
\- and possibly detailed diagnostic information, coded as specified in 3GPP TS
23.040, under SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT and SMS-DELIVERY-REPORT. If the SM entity that
returns the SM Delivery Failure error includes detailed diagnostic
information, it shall be forwarded in the MAP_MO_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE and in
the MAP_MT_FORWARD_SHORT_MESSAGE response.
\- message waiting list full, i.e. no further SC address can be added to the
message waiting list.
\- Subscriber busy for MT SMS, i.e. the mobile terminated short message
transfer cannot be completed because:
\- another mobile terminated short message transfer is going on and the
delivery node does not support message buffering; or
\- another mobile terminated short message transfer is going on and it is not
possible to buffer the message for later delivery; or
\- the message was buffered but it is not possible to deliver the message
before the expiry of the buffering time defined in 3GPP TS 23.040;
\- Absent Subscriber SM, i.e. the mobile terminated short message transfer
cannot be completed because the network cannot contact the subscriber.
Diagnostic information regarding the reason for the subscriber\'s absence may
be included with this error.
i) Location services problem:
  * Unauthorised Requesting Network
  * Unauthorised LCS Client with detailed reasons as follows:
  * NoAdditional Information
  * Client not in MS Privacy Exception List
  * Call to Client not setup
  * Disallowed by Local Regulatory Requirements

See definition in clause 7.6.1.
[IMSI]{.underline}
See definition in clause 7.6.2.
[MSC Address]{.underline}
See definition for MSC number in clause 7.6.2. The MSC address is used for
short message delivery only and for each incoming call set-up attempt the MSRN
will be requested from the VLR.
[VLR number]{.underline}
See definition in clause 7.6.2.
[LMSI]{.underline}
See definition in clause 7.6.2. It is an operator option to provide the LMSI
from the VLR; it is mandatory for the HLR to support the LMSI handling
procedures.
[Supported CAMEL Phases]{.underline}
This parameter indicates which phases of CAMEL are supported. Must be present
if a CAMEL phase different from phase 1 is supported. Otherwise may be absent.
[HLR number]{.underline}
See definition in clause 7.6.2. The presence of this parameter is mandatory in
case of successful HLR updating.
[SoLSA Support Indicator]{.underline}
This parameter is used by the VLR to indicate to the HLR in the Update
Location indication that SoLSA is supported. If this parameter is not included
in the Update Location indication and the Subscriber is marked as only allowed
to roam in Subscribed LSAs, then the HLR shall reject the roaming and indicate
to the VLR that roaming is not allowed to that Subscriber in the VLR.
This SoLSA Support Indicator shall be stored by the HLR per VLR where there
are Subscribers roaming. If a Subscriber is marked as only allowed to roam in
Subscribed LSAs while roaming in a VLR and no SoLSA Support indicator is
stored for that VLR, the location status of that Subscriber shall be set to
Restricted.
[IST Support Indicator]{.underline}
This parameter is used to indicate to the HLR that the VMSC supports basic IST
functionality, that is, the VMSC is able to terminate the Subscriber Call
Activity that originated the IST Alert when it receives the IST alert response
indicating that the call(s) shall be terminated. If this parameter is not
included in the Update Location indication and the Subscriber is marked as an
IST Subscriber, then the HLR may limit the service for the subscriber (by
inducing an Operator Determined barring of Roaming, Incoming or Outgoing
calls), or allow service assuming the associated risk of not having the basic
IST mechanism available.
This parameter can also indicate that the VMSC supports the IST Command
service, including the ability to terminate all calls being carried for the
identified subscriber by using the IMSI as a key. If this additional
capability is not included in the Update Location indication and the HLR
supports the IST Command capability, then the HLR may limit the service for
the subscriber (by inducing an Operator Determined barring of Roaming,
Incoming or Outgoing calls), or allow service assuming the associated risk of

network entity about the update by sending the previous network entity a
Cancel Location message. It is used if Super-Charger is supported in the
network and either the serving network entity has not been able to inform the
previous network entity that MS has moved (i.e. if it has not sent Send
Identification to the previous serving entity) or the MTRF Supported flag is
set in the MAP_UPDATE LOCATION request.
[CS LCS Not Supported by UE]{.underline}
See definition in clause 7.6.11.
[V-GMLC address]{.underline}
See definition in clause 7.6.2.

This cause will be sent if the MS is not allowed to roam into the PLMN
indicated by the VLR number. The cause is qualified by the roaming restriction
reason \"PLMN Not Allowed\", \"Supported RAT Types Not Allowed\" or \"Operator
Determined Barring\". If no qualification is received (HLR with MAP Version
1), \"PLMN Not Allowed\" is taken as default.
This cause shall be used when the HLR rejects a MAP Update Location request
received for an MSISDN-less subscription from a VLR not supporting MSISDN-less
operation (see subclause 3.6.1.5 of 3GPP TS 23.012 [23]).

This service is used between HLR and VLR to delete a subscriber record from
the VLR. It may be invoked automatically when an MS moves from one VLR area to
another, to remove the subscriber record from the old VLR, or by the HLR
operator to enforce a location updating from the VLR to the HLR, e.g. on
withdrawal of a subscription.
Also this service is used between HLR and SGSN to delete a subscriber record
from the SGSN. It may be invoked automatically when an MS moves from one SGSN
area to another, to remove the subscriber record from the old SGSN, or by the
HLR operator to enforce a location updating from the SGSN to the HLR.
In an EPS this service is used between HSS and IWF and between IWF and IWF to
delete the subscriber record from the MME or SGSN or to release bearer
resources without deleting the subscriber record.

If CUG-Feature is received without preferential CUG, the VLR shall interpret
that no preferential CUG applies.
If the VLR detects that there is overlapping in the information received
within a dialogue, it shall send the error Unexpected Data Value.
Note that data consistency between CUG subscription data and CUG feature data
is the responsibility of the HLR.
If the VLR does not support the CUG service it returns its code to the HLR in

error is sent back).
This parameter is used by the SGSN only for LCS. If the SGSN receives an
Indication containing any LCS related supplementary service codes which it
does not support/allocate it returns them to the HLR in the parameter SS-Code
List and therefore discards the unsupported service codes received (no error
is sent back). SS-codes not related to the supported LCS capability set shall
be discarded.
If the IWF receives an Indication containing any LCS related supplementary
service codes, it returns them to the HSS in the parameter SS-Code List and

transferred to the VLR or to the SGSN or IWF when the subscriber is roaming
into the HPLMN and when the parameter Subscriber Status is set to the value
Operator Determined Barring. Note that all HPLMN Operator Determined Barring
Categories shall be set to their actual status.
If Subscriber Status is set to the value Operator Determined Barring and no
Operator Determined Barring HPLMN data is present then the VLR or the SGSN or
IWF shall not apply any HPLMN specific ODB services to the subscriber. This
parameter is used by the VLR and the SGSN and IWF.

against the CC and NDC of the VLR, the SGSN or the MME to be updated.
NOTE 2: Support of this parameter is a network operator option and it will not
be sent to networks which do not support Regional Subscription.
Regional subscription data that have been stored previously in a subscriber
data record in the VLR, in the SGSN or in the MME are completely replaced by
the regional subscription data received in an Insert Subscriber Data
indication during either an Update Location or Restore Data procedure or a
stand alone Insert Subscriber data procedure.
After the regional subscription data are inserted the VLR or the SGSN shall
derive whether its location areas are allowed or not. If the whole MSC or SGSN
area is restricted it will be reported to HLR by returning the Regional
Subscription Response.
The VLR or the SGSN returns a Regional Subscription Response indicating that a
problem with the Zone Code has been detected in one of the following cases:
\- Too Many Zone Codes: more than 10 Zone Codes are to be stored in the VLR or
in the SGSN.
\- Regional Subscription Not Supported by the VLR or the SGSN.
\- Zone Codes Conflict: the VLR or the SGSN detects that the zone codes
indicate conflicting service permission for a location area.
Zone codes which have no mapping to location areas shall be ignored.
If a sequence of MAP_INSERT_SUBSCRIBER_DATA services is used during a
dialogue, Regional Subscription Data shall be accepted only in one service.
Regional Subscription Data received in a subsequent service shall be rejected
with the error Unexpected Data Value.

indication, the VLR, the SGSN or the MME may base the retrieval of subscribers
to be restored on their IMSI: the subscribers affected by the reset are those
whose IMSI leading digits are equal to one of these numbers. If the parameter
is absent, subscribers to be restored are those for which the
OriginatingEntityNumber received at location updating time matches the
equivalent parameter of the Reset Indication.
This parameter shall only be applicable for a restart of the HLR/HSS.
### 8.10.2 MAP_FORWARD_CHECK_SS_INDICATION service
#### 8.10.2.1 Definition
This service may be used by an HLR as an implementation option, to indicate to
a mobile subscriber that supplementary services parameters may have been
altered, e.g. due to a restart. If received from the HLR, the VLR shall
forward this indication to the MSC, which in turn forwards it to the MS. The
HLR only sends this indication after successful completion of the subscriber
data retrieval from HLR to VLR that ran embedded in a MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION
procedure.

from the VLR; it is mandatory for the HLR to support the LMSI handling
procedures.
[Supported CAMEL Phases]{.underline}
This parameter indicates which phases of CAMEL are supported. Must be present
if a CAMEL phase different from phase 1 is supported. Otherwise may be absent.
[SoLSA Support Indicator]{.underline}
This parameter is used by the VLR to indicate to the HLR in the Restore Data
indication that SoLSA is supported. If this parameter is not included in the
Restore Data indication then the HLR shall not perform any specific error
handling.
This SoLSA Support Indicator shall be stored by the HLR per VLR where there
are Subscribers roaming. If a Subscriber is marked as only allowed to roam in
Subscribed LSAs while roaming in a VLR and no SoLSA Support indicator is
stored for that VLR, the location status of that Subscriber shall be set to
Restricted.

This parameter is used to indicate to the HLR that the VMSC supports basic IST
functionality, that is, the VMSC is able to terminate the Subscriber Call
Activity that originated the IST Alert when it receives the IST alert response
indicating that the call(s) shall be terminated. If this parameter is not
included in the Restore Data indication and the Subscriber is marked as an IST
Subscriber, then the HLR may limit the service for the subscriber (by inducing
an Operator Determined barring of Outgoing calls), or allow service assuming
the associated risk of not having the basic IST mechanism available.
This parameter can also indicate that the VMSC supports the IST Command
service, including the ability to terminate all calls being carried for the
identified subscriber by using the IMSI as a key. If this additional
capability is not included in the Restore Data indication and the HLR supports
the IST Command capability, then the HLR may limit the service for the
subscriber (by inducing an Operator Determined barring of Outgoing calls), or

# 14 General
## 14.1 Overview
Clauses 14 to 17 specify the protocol elements to be used to provide the MAP
services described in clause 7.
Clause 15 specifies the elements of procedures for the MAP protocol. Clause 16
specifies the mapping onto TC service primitives. Clause 17 specifies the
application contexts, operation packages and abstract syntaxes for the MAP
protocol as well as the encoding rules to be applied.
## 14.2 Underlying services
The MAP protocol relies on the services provided by the Transaction
Capabilities (TC) of Signalling System Number No. 7, as referenced in clause
6.
## 14.3 Model
The MAP Protocol Machine (MAP PM) can be modelled as a collection of service
state machines (SSMs) - one per MAP specific service invoked - coordinated by
a MAP dialogue control function with its one state machine: MAP dialogue state
machine (DSM). There are two types of Service State Machines: Requesting
Service State Machines (RSM) and Performing Service State Machines (PSM).
A new invocation of a MAP PM is employed on the receipt of a MAP-OPEN request
primitive or a TC-BEGIN indication primitive. Each invocation controls exactly
one MAP dialogue. For each MAP specific service invoked during a dialogue, a
MAP RSM is created at the requestor\'s side and a MAP PSM is created at the
performer\'s side.
This modelling is used only to facilitate understanding and the MAP behaviour
descriptions and is not intended to suggest any implementation. SDL
descriptions are organised according to this model.
How the MAP-service-user and the MAP refer to a MAP dialogue (i.e. a MAP PM
invocation) is a local implementation matter.
How TC dialogue identifiers are assigned to a MAP PM invocation is also a
local implementation matter.
## 14.4 Conventions
The behaviour of the MAP PM depends on the application-context-name associated
with the dialogue. One major difference is that the MAP requests the transfer
of the application-context-name by TC only for those contexts which do not
belong to the so-called \"version one context set\".
The \"version one context set\" is a set of application-contexts which model
the behaviour of a MAP V1 implementation according to the latest phase 1
version of GSM 09.02. This set is defined in clause 15.
The procedures described in clause 15 are used when the application-context-
name does not refer to a dialogue between an MSC and its VLR. When the
application-context-name refers to a dialogue between an MSC and its VLR the
MAP PM procedures are a local implementation matter.
# 15 Elements of procedure
## 15.1 Handling of unknown operations
Unknown operations (i.e. a standard operation introduced in a later version of
the MAP specification, or a private operation) can be introduced into MAP in a
backwards compatible way. This means that the receiver of an unknown operation
shall, if the dialogue state allows it, send a TC-REJECT component to the
sender of the operation indicating \'unrecognised operation\' and continue
with the processing of further components or messages exchanged within the
dialogue as if the unknown operation had not been received.
The standardised structure of a MAP dialogue shall not be affected by the
invocation of unknown operations, i.e. if a dialogue uses only a TC-BEGIN
message which is acknowledged by a TC-END message, a TC-CONTINUE message shall
not be used to invoke an unknown operation. However the standardised structure
of a MAP dialogue may be affected by the rejection of unknown operations, i.e.
if a dialogue uses only a TC-BEGIN message which is acknowledged by a TC-END
message, a TC-CONTINUE message followed by a TC-END message may be used to
carry the rejection of an unknown operation and the response to the
standardised operation. The entity which initiated a dialogue whose
standardised structure is a TC-BEGIN message which is acknowledged by a TC-END
message shall not send any messages in that dialogue after the TC-BEGIN. Note
that if the dialogue structure is affected as described in this paragraph the
TC-CONTINUE shall include the dialogue portion required to confirm the
acceptance of the dialogue.
Unknown operations may be invoked in the following types of message (there is
no restriction as to how many unknown operations can be invoked in a message):
\- TC-BEGIN: the component to invoke the unknown operation shall follow the
component of the standard operation which is included in this message.
\- TC-CONTINUE: the component to invoke the unknown operation may be
transported as the only component in a stand-alone message or may be grouped
with existing operations. In the latter case a specific sequencing of
components is not required.
\- TC-END: if the component to invoke the unknown operation is grouped with an
existing operation a specific sequencing of components is not required
The TC-REJECT component may be sent in the following messages:
\- TC-CONTINUE or TC-END: either as the only component of the message or
grouped with an existing component. The choice is up to the MAP-Service User.
If the received message contains only unknown operations the MAP-Service User
shall send the TC-REJECT components in a TC-CONTINUE message to the peer
entity, if the dialogue state allows it.
If the received message contains unknown operations and standard operations
and the standardised structure of the dialogue requires the response to the
standard operation to be sent within a TC-END message, then the MAP-Service
User may send the response to the standard operations and the TC-REJECT
components for the unknown operations in a TC-CONTINUE message followed by a
TC-END message. Neither a specific distribution of the components to the TC
messages nor a specific sequencing of components is required.
Note that the SDL diagrams of clauses 19 - 25 do not show the report to the
MAP-Service User about the reception of the unknown operation. This has been
done for simplicity of description; the MAP PM may inform the MAP-Service
User.
The sender of the unknown operation shall ensure that there is enough room in
the used message for the unknown operation.
## 15.2 Dialogue establishment
The establishment of a MAP dialogue involves two MAP-service-users: the
dialogue-initiator and the dialogue-responder.
This procedure is driven by the following signals:
\- a MAP-OPEN request primitive from the dialogue-initiator;
\- a TC-BEGIN indication primitive occurring at the responding side;
\- a MAP-OPEN response primitive from the dialogue-responder;
\- the first TC-CONTINUE indication primitive occurring at the initiating
side;
and under specific conditions:
\- a TC-END indication primitive occurring at the initiating side;
\- a TC-U-ABORT indication primitive occurring at the initiating side;
\- a TC-P-ABORT indication primitive occurring at the initiating side.
One instance of the MAP dialogue state machine runs at the initiating side,
and one at the responding side.
### 15.2.1 Behaviour at the initiating side
The behaviour of the MAP dialogue state machine at the initiating side is
defined in sheets 1 -- 8 of the process MAP_DSM (figure 15.6/3).
Sheet 3: When the MAP dialogue state machine at the initiating side is waiting
for a response from the responding side, a TC-END indication which echoes the
AC name which was sent in the TC-BEGIN indicates acceptance of the dialogue.
Sheet 3: If the dialogue opening is accepted, any components included in the
TC-END are processed and passed to the MAP-Service User. The dialogue is
closed by sending a MAP-CLOSE to the MAP-Service User.
Sheet 3, sheet 4, sheet 5, sheet 6, sheet 7, sheet 8: when a dialogue is
terminated, the MAP dialogue state machine terminates all instances of the
Requesting_MAP_SSM which are active for this dialogue.
Sheet 4: A TC-P-ABORT with an abort parameter Incorrect_Transaction_Portion
indicates that the responding side does not support a MAP version higher than
1. This triggers a MAP-OPEN confirm indicating that the dialogue is refused,
with a refuse reason potential version incompatibility. The MAP-Service User
may then decide to retry the dialogue at MAP version 1.
Sheet 8: When the MAP dialogue state machine at the initiating side is waiting
for a response from the responding side, a TC-CONTINUE indication which echoes
the AC name which was sent in the TC-BEGIN indicates acceptance of the
dialogue.
Sheet 8: If the dialogue opening is accepted, any components included in the
TC-CONTINUE are processed and passed to the MAP-Service User. The dialogue has
then reached the established state.
### 15.2.2 Behaviour at the responding side
The behaviour of the MAP dialogue state machine at the responding side is
defined in sheets 0 -- 14 of the process MAP_DSM (figure 15.6/3).
Sheet 9: If no application context information is included in the TC-BEGIN
indication, this implies a MAP version 1 dialogue. An explicit application
context indicating version 1 is treated as abnormal behaviour.
Sheet 11: The v1 application context name which corresponds to a v1 operation
is derived using the information in table 15.2/1.
Table 15.2/1: Mapping of V1 operation codes on to application-context-names

* * *
NOTE 1: These symbolic names refer to the object identifier value defined in
clause 17 and allocated to each application-context used for the MAP.
NOTE 2: The choice between the application contexts is based on the parameters
received in the operation.
Sheet 12: If the dialogue is accepted, each component present in the TC-BEGIN
is forwarded to an instance of a Performing_MAP_SSM, by executing the
procedure Process_Components.
Sheet 13: If the MAP dialogue state machine receives a MAP-OPEN response with
a result accepted, it waits for any MAP specific service request or response
primitives or a MAP-DELIMITER request.
Sheet 13, sheet 14: When a dialogue is terminated, the MAP dialogue state
machine terminates all instances of the Requesting_MAP_SSM or
Performing_MAP_SSM which are active for this dialogue.
Sheet 14: A MAP-DELIMITER request triggers a TC-CONTINUE request to accept the
dialogue. The dialogue has then reached the established state.
## 15.3 Dialogue continuation
Once established the dialogue is said to be in a continuation phase. The
behaviour of the MAP dialogue state machine in this phase is defined in sheets
15 -- 17 of the process MAP_DSM (figure 15.6/3).
Both MAP users can request the transfer of MAP APDUs until one of them
requests the termination of the dialogue.
Normal closure of an established dialogue is shown on sheet 16; abnormal
termination is shown on sheet 17.
## 15.4 Load control
If an entity which should respond to a MAP dialogue opening request is
overloaded, it uses the AC of the request to determine whether to discard the
request.
The priority level allocated to each application-context is described in
clause 5, tables 5.1/1, 5.1/2, and 5.1/3.
## 15.5 Procedures for MAP specific services
This clause describes the MAP procedures for MAP specific services. These
procedures are driven by the following types of event:
\- a MAP specific request or a MAP specific response primitive;
\- a component handling primitive from TC.
A Service State Machine is activated when of one of the following signals is
received:
\- a MAP request primitive, which activates a requesting SSM;
\- a TC-INVOKE indication primitive without a linked identifier, which
activates a performing SSM.
For component handling primitives there are two types of event:
\- events which activate a Service State Machine or which can be related to an
existing one;
\- events which cannot be related to a Service State Machine.
### 15.5.1 Service invocation
The behaviour of the requesting SSM which handles a service is defined by the
SDL for the process Requesting_MAP_SSM. The requesting SSM receives a MAP
service request from the MAP-Service User via the MAP dialogue state machine
and sends a TC-INVOKE request to TCAP. When a confirm is received from TCAP
via the MAP dialogue state machine, the requesting SSM forwards a MAP service
confirm to the MAP-Service User.
The response to a MAP service invocation may come in the form of a linked
request. If the linked request corresponds to a class 4 operation, this is
handled by the requesting SSM. If the linked request corresponds to a class 1,
2 or 3 operation, the MAP dialogue state machine sends a notification to the
requesting SSM and creates an instance of a performing SSM to handle the
linked request. The test \"Linked_Operation_Allowed\" on sheet 3 of the
process Requesting_MAP_SSM takes the (TRUE) exit if the definition of the
parent operation includes the received linked operation as a permitted linked
operation; otherwise the test takes the (FALSE) exit.
The mapping of MAP specific services on to remote operations is given in table
16.2/1.
### 15.5.2 Void
### 15.5.3 Service invocation receipt
The behaviour of the performing SSM which handles a service is defined by the
SDL for the process Performing_MAP_SSM. The performing SSM receives a TC-
INVOKE component from TCAP via the MAP dialogue state machine and sends a MAP
service indication to the MAP-Service User. When a MAP service response is
received from the MAP-Service User via the MAP dialogue state machine, the
performing SSM forwards a TC-RESULT or TC-U-ERROR component to TCAP.
### 15.5.4 Void
### 15.5.5 Handling of components received from TC
The procedure Process_Components shows the handling of components received in
a TC-BEGIN, TC-CONTINUE or TC-END message.
Sheet 2: If a linked invoke component corresponds to a class 4 operation, the
MAP dialogue state machine sends it to the requesting SSM instance identified
by the linked invoke ID. If a linked invoke component corresponds to any other
class of operation, the MAP dialogue state machine sends a notification to the
requesting SSM instance identified by the linked invoke ID, creates an
instance of a performing SSM and sends the invoke component to it.
## 15.6 SDL descriptions
The following SDL specification describes a system which includes three
blocks: MAP-user, MAP-provider and TC.
Such a system resides in each network component supporting MAP and
communicates with its peers via the lower layers of the signalling network
which are part of the environment.
Only the MAP-provider is fully described in this clause. The various types of
processes which form the MAP-User block and the TC block are described
respectively in clauses 18 to 25 of the present document and in CCITT
Recommendation Q.774.
The MAP-Provider block communicates with the MAP_USER via two channels U1 and
U2. Via U1 the MAP-provider receives the MAP request and response primitives.
Via U2 it sends the MAP indication and confirm primitives.
The MAP-Provider block communicates with TC via two channels P1 and P2. Via P1
the MAP-Provider sends all the TC request primitives. Via P2 it receives all
the TC indication primitives.
The MAP-Provider block is composed of the four following types of process:
a) MAP_DSM: This type of process handles a dialogue for transport of MAP
messages. There exists one process instance per MAP dialogue.
b) Load_Ctrl: This type of process is in charge of load control. There is only
one instance of this process in each system.
c) Requesting_MAP_SSM: This type of process handles a MAP service requested
during a dialogue. An instance of this process is created by the instance of
the MAP_DSM process for each requested MAP service.
d) Performing_MAP_SSM: This type of process handles a MAP service performed
during a dialogue. An instance of this process is created by the instance of
the MAP_DSM process for each MAP service to be performed.
A process MAP_DSM exchanges external signals with other blocks as well as
internal signals with the other processes of the MAP-Provider block. The
external signals are either MAP service primitives or TC service primitives.
The signal routes used by the various processes are organised as follows:
a) A process MAP_DSM receives and sends events from/to the MAP_user via signal
route User1/User2. These routes use channels U1 and U2 respectively.
b) A process MAP_DSM receives and sends events from/to the TCAP via signal
route TC1/TC2. These routes use channels P1 and P2 respectively.
c) A process MAP_DSM receives and sends events from/to the LOAD_CTRL process
via signal route Load1/Load2. These routes are internal.
d) A process MAP_DSM sends events to the Performing_MAP_SSM processes via
signal route Intern1. This route is internal.
e) A process MAP_DSM sends events to the Requesting_MAP_SSM processes via
signal route Intern2. This route is internal.
f) A process Performing_MAP_SSM sends events to the MAP_USER via signal route
User3. This route uses channel U2.
g) A process Performing_MAP_SSM sends events to the TCAP via signal route TC3.
This route uses channel P1.
h) A process Requesting_MAP_SSM sends events to the MAP_USER via signal route
User4. This route uses channel U2.
i) A process Requesting_MAP_SSM sends events to the TCAP via signal route TC4.
This route uses channel P1.

# 16 Mapping on to TC services
## 16.1 Dialogue control
Dialogue control services are mapped to TC dialogue handling services. The TC-
UNI service is not used by the MAP PM.
### 16.1.1 Directly mapped parameters
The following parameters of the MAP-OPEN request and indication primitives are
directly mapped on to the corresponding parameters of the TC-BEGIN primitives:
\- destination address;
\- originating address.
### 16.1.2 Use of other parameters of dialogue handling primitives
#### 16.1.2.1 Dialogue Id
The value of this parameter is associated with the MAP PM invocation in an
implementation dependent manner.
#### 16.1.2.2 Application-context-name
The application-context-name parameter of a MAP primitive is mapped to the
application-context-name parameter of TC dialogue handling primitives
according to the rules described in clause 15.1.
#### 16.1.2.3 User information
The user information parameter of TC dialogue primitives is used to carry the
MAP dialogue APDUs.
#### 16.1.2.4 Component present
This parameter is used by the MAP PM as described in CCITT Recommendation
Q.771. It is not visible to the MAP user.
#### 16.1.2.5 Termination
The value of this parameter of the TC-END request primitive is set by the MAP
PM on the basis of the release method parameter of the MAP-CLOSE request
primitive, except when the dialogue state machine is in the state DIALOGUE
INITIATED, in which case the Termination parameter shall always indicate
\"pre-arranged end\".
#### 16.1.2.6 P-Abort-Cause
Values of the P-abort-cause parameter are mapped to the values of the
provider-reason parameter of the MAP‑P‑ABORT indication primitive according to
table 16.1/1, except in the dialogue initiated phase for the
\"incorrectTransactionPortion\" and \"noCommonDialoguePortion\" values which
are mapped to the \"potential incompatibility problem\" value of the refuse-
reason parameter of the MAP-OPEN cnf primitive. The source parameter in the
MAP-P-ABORT ind takes the value \"TC problem\".
#### 16.1.2.7 Quality of service
The quality of service of TC request primitives is set by the MAP as shown
below.
\- Return option: \"Return message on error\" or \"Discard message on error\"
as required by the network operator;
\- Sequence control: \"Sequence guaranteed\" or \"Sequence result not
guaranteed\" as required by the network operator;
\- \"Sequence guaranteed\" shall be used when a segmented result is to be
transferred (e.g. subscriber data in response to SendParameters). It may also
be appropriate to use Sequence guaranteed when a series of
InsertSubscriberData, ProcessAccessSignalling or ForwardAccessSignalling
operations is used.
It is essential that the TC message which indicates acceptance of a dialogue
opening request is received by the dialogue initiator before any subsequent
message in that dialogue; otherwise the dialogue opening will fail. The
dialogue responder shall ensure that this requirement is met by:
\- Sending the dialogue acceptance message in a TC‑END, if the dialogue
structure requires it; or
\- Using \"Sequence guaranteed\", if the dialogue acceptance message is sent
in a TC‑CONTINUE; or
\- Waiting until the dialogue acceptance message has been acknowledged by the
dialogue initiator before sending a subsequent message, if the dialogue
acceptance message is sent in a TC‑CONTINUE.

## 16.2 Service specific procedures
Specific services are mapped to TC component handling services.
### 16.2.1 Directly mapped parameters
The Invoke Id parameter of the MAP request and indication primitive is
directly mapped on to the Invoke Id parameter of the component handling
primitives.
### 16.2.2 Use of other parameters of component handling primitives
#### 16.2.2.1 Dialogue Id
The value of this parameter is associated with the MAP PM invocation in an
implementation dependent manner.
#### 16.2.2.2 Class
The value of this parameter is set by the MAP PM according to the type of the
operation to be invoked.
#### 16.2.2.3 Linked Id
When a service response is mapped to a class 4 operation, the value of this
parameter is set by the MAP PM and corresponds to the value assigned by the
user to the initial service request (i.e. the value of the invoke ID parameter
of the request primitive). Otherwise if such a parameter is included in MAP
request/indication primitives it is directly mapped to the linked ID parameter
of the associated TC‑INVOKE request/indication primitives.
#### 16.2.2.4 Operation
When mapping a request primitive on to a Remote Operations PDU (invoke), the
MAP PM shall set the operation code according to the mapping described in
table 16.2/1.
When mapping a response primitive on to a Remote Operations service, the MAP
PM shall set the operation code of the TC-RESULT-L/NL primitive (if required)
to the same value as the one received at invocation time.

# 17 Abstract syntax of the MAP protocol
## 17.1 General
This clause specifies the Abstract Syntaxes for the Mobile Application Part as
well as the associated set of Operations and Errors, using the Abstract Syntax
Notation One (ASN.1), defined in ITU-T Recommendations X.680 and X.681 with
additions as defined in clause 17.1.4 on Compatibility Considerations and the
OPERATION and ERROR external information object classes, defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.880.
The Abstract Syntax is defined for all interfaces specified in clause 4.4
except for the A- and B-interfaces.
The Mobile Application Part protocol is defined by two Abstract Syntaxes:
\- one Abstract Syntax which encompass all Operations and Errors identified by
the various MAP subsystem numbers.
This Abstract Syntax represents the set of values each of which is a value of
the ASN.1 type TCAPMessages. TCMessage as defined in ITU-T Recommendation
Q.773 with the component relationconstraint sections resolved by the operation
and error codes included in the ASN.1 modules MAP-*Operations and MAP-Errors.
However, only the subset of this abstract syntax which is required by the
procedures defined for an entity needs to be supported.
\- one Abstract Syntax identified by the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value MAP-
DialogueInformation.map-DialogueAS.
This Abstract Syntax represents the set of values each of which is a value of
the ASN.1 type MAP-DialogueInformation.MAP-DialoguePDU. Such a value of the
ASN.1 single-ASN.1-type element is contained within the user-information
element of the TCAPMessages.DialoguePortion ASN.1 type. This Abstract Syntax
name is to be used as a direct reference.
### 17.1.1 Encoding rules
The encoding rules which are applicable to the defined Abstract Syntaxes are
the Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Syntax Notation One, defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.690 with the same exceptions as in ITU-T Recommendation
Q.773, clause 4 Message Representation.
When the definite form is used for length encoding, a data value of length
less than 128 octets must have the length encoded in the short form.
When the long form is employed to code a length, the minimum number of octets
shall be used to code the length field.
OCTET STRING values and BIT STRING values must be encoded in a primitive form.
There is no restriction to the use of empty constructors (e.g. an empty
SEQUENCE type). That is, the encoding of the content of any data value shall
consist of zero, one or more octets.
### 17.1.2 Use of TC
The mapping of OPERATION and ERROR to TC components is defined in ETS 300 287
(version 2) which is based on ITU-T Recommendation Q.773.
NOTE 1: The class of an operation is not stated explicitly but is specified as
well in the ASN.1 operation definition.
Class 1: RESULT and ERROR appear in ASN.1 operation definition.
Class 2: only ERROR appears in ASN.1 operation definition.
Class 3: only RESULT appears in ASN.1 operation definition.
Class 4: both RESULT and ERROR do not appear in ASN.1 operation definition.
The field \"ARGUMENT\", \"PARAMETER\" or \"RESULT\" (for information objects
of class OPERATION and ERROR) is always optional from a syntactic point of
view. However, except when specifically mentioned with the ASN.1 comment \"--
optional\" , the \"parameter\" part of a component has to be considered as
mandatory from a semantic point of view.
When an optional element is missing in an invoke component or in an inner data
structure while it is required by the context, an error component is returned
if specified in the information object associated with the operation ; the
associated type of error is \"DataMissing\". This holds also when the entire
parameter of an invoke component is missing while it is required by the
context.
NOTE 2: When a mandatory element is missing in the parameter or inner data
structure of any component, a reject component is returned (if the dialogue
still exists). The problem code to be used is \"Mistyped parameter\".
The Timer Values used in the operation definitions are indicated as ASN.1
comments. The Timer Value Ranges are:
s = from 3 seconds to 10 seconds;
m = from 15 seconds to 30 seconds;
ml = from 1 minute to 10 minutes;
l = from 28 hours to 38 hours.
#### 17.1.2.1 Use of Global Operation and Error codes defined outside MAP
An entity supporting an application context greater than 2 shall be capable of
receiving an operation or error code, within an application context defined in
GSM 29.002, encoded as either an Object Identifier (as defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.690 ) or an integer value (as defined in clause 17.5).
Related restrictions regarding the use of Object Identifiers are as follows:
\- The length of the Object Identifier shall not exceed 16 octets and the
number of components of the Object Identifier shall not exceed 16.
\- Object Identifiers shall be used only for operations or errors defined
outside of GSM 29.002.
\- Global error codes may be sent only in response to a global operation. If a
standard operation is received then a global error code shall not be sent in
response.
Handling of an unknown operation codes by the receiving entity is defined in
clause 15.1.1.
### 17.1.3 Use of information elements defined outside MAP
An information element or a set of information elements (messages)
transparently carried in the Mobile Application Part but defined in other
recommendations/technical specifications are handled in one of the following
ways:
i) The contents of each information element (without the octets encoding the
identifier and the length in the recommendation/technical specification where
it is defined unless explicitly stated otherwise) is carried as the value of
an ASN.1 type derived from the OCTET STRING data type. Additionally, the
internal structure may be explained by means of comments. In case of
misalignment the referred to recommendation/technical specification takes
precedence.
ii) The complete information element (including the octets encoding the
identifier and the length in the recommendation/technical specification where
it is defined) or set of information elements and the identity of the
associated protocol are carried as the value of the ExternalSignalInfo data
type defined in the present document. Where more than one information element
is carried, the information elements are sent contiguously with no filler
octets between them.
### 17.1.4 Compatibility considerations
The following ASN.1 modules conform to ITU-T Recommendation X.680 and X.681 .
An extension marker (\"...\") is used wherever future protocol extensions are
foreseen.
The \"...\" construct applies only to SEQUENCE and ENUMERATED data types. An
entity supporting a version greater than 1 shall not reject an unsupported
extension following \"...\" of that SEQUENCE or ENUMERATED data type. The
Encoding Rules from clause 17.1.1 apply to every element of the whole Transfer
Syntax especially to the ASN.1 type EXTERNAL.
The extension container \"privateExtensionList\" is defined in this
specification in order to carry extensions which are defined outside this
specification. Private extensions can be defined by, for example, network
operators, manufacturers, and regional standardisation bodies.
Private extensions shall:
1) if included in operations of an AC of V2, follow the extension marker and
be tagged using PRIVATE tags up to and including 29.
NOTE: This type of extension is in most cases used only within a PLMN.
2) if included in operations of an AC of V3 or higher: be included only in the
Private Extension Container that is defined in the specification.
NOTE: This type of extension can be used between PLMNs.
Private extensions shall not be included in v2 supplementary service
operations.
Private extensions shall not be included within user error for RegisterCCEntry
and EraseCCEntry operations.
PCS extensions shall be included in the PCS Extension Container that is
defined in this specification.
In order to improve extensibility, a few error parameters have been defined as
a CHOICE between the version 2 description and a SEQUENCE including the
version 2 description and an extension container. Operations used in a
v2-application-context must consider only the first alternative while
operations used in a vn-application-context (n>2) must consider only the
second alternative.
### 17.1.5 Structure of the Abstract Syntax of MAP
For each MAP parameter which has to be transferred by a MAP Protocol Data Unit
(MAP message), there is a PDU field (an ASN.1 type) which has the same name as
the corresponding parameter, except for the differences required by the ASN.1
notation (blanks between words are removed or replaced by hyphen, the first
letter of the first word is capital and the first letter of each of the
following words ise capitalised, e.g. \"no reply condition time\" is mapped to
\"NoReplyConditionTime\"). Additionally some words may be abbreviated as
follows:
bs basic service
ch call handling
cug closed user group
ho handover
ic incoming call
id identity
info information
mm mobility management
lcs location services
ms mobile service
oc outgoing call
om operation & maintenance
pw Password
sm short message service
ss supplementary service
The MAP protocol is composed of several ASN.1 modules dealing with either
operations, errors, data types, and, if applicable, split into those dealing
with mobile services, call handling services, supplementary services and short
message services. For operations and errors the code values are given as
parameters, in order to allow use of the defined information objects also by
other protocols (e.g. 3GPP TS 24.080 [38]). The ASN.1 source lines are
preceded by line-numbers at the left margin in order to enable the usage of
the cross-reference in annex A.
The module containing the definition of the operation packages for MAP is:
1\. MAP-OperationPackages.
The module containing the definition of the application contexts for MAP is:
2\. MAP-ApplicationContexts.
The module containing the data types for the Abstract Syntax to be used for

### 17.1.6 Application Contexts
The following informative table lists the latest versions of the Application
Contexts used in this specification, with the operations used by them and,

NOTE (*): The syntax of the operations is not the same as in previous versions
unless explicitly stated
In the word-text of ASN.1 Modules hidden text is used for marking the begin
(.\$modulename), interrupt (.#), continuation (.\$) and end (.#END) of ASN.1
Source. This allows to automatically extract the ASN.1 Sources. These markers
should not be deleted! In addition, hidden text is also used to overcome some
compiler restrictions
In addition no line break should occur when printing a paragraph in ASN.1
source, otherwise the line-numbering of word is inconsistent with the line-
numbering in Annex A.
For Completeness the module MAP-Frame is included as hidden text.

## 17.2 Operation packages
### 17.2.1 General aspects
This clause describes the operation-packages which are used to build the
application-contexts defined in clause 17.3.
Each operation-package is a specification of the roles of a pair of
communicating objects (i.e. a pair of MAP-Providers), in terms of operations
which they can invoke of each other.
The grouping of operations into one or several packages does not necessarily
imply any grouping in terms of Application Service Elements.
The following ASN.1 information object class is used to describe operation-
packages in this clause:
OPERATION-PACKAGE ::= CLASS {
**& Both OPERATION OPTIONAL,**
**& Consumer OPERATION OPTIONAL,**
**& Supplier OPERATION OPTIONAL,**
**& id OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE OPTIONAL }**
**WITH SYNTAX {**
**[ OPERATIONS &Both ]**
**[ CONSUMER INVOKES &Supplier ]**
**[ SUPPLIER INVOKES &Consumer ]**
**[ ID &id ] }**
Since the application-context definitions provided in clause 17.3 use only an
informal description technique, only the type notation is used in the
following clauses to define operation-packages.
The following definitions are used throughout this clause (n>=2):
\- v1-only operation: An operation which shall be used only in v1 application-
contexts;
\- vn-only operation: An operation which shall be used only in vn application-
contexts;
\- v(n-1)-operation: An operation whose specification has not been modified
since the MAP v(n-1) specifications or if the modifications are considered as
not affecting v(n-1) implementations;
\- v(n-1)-equivalent operation: The version of an operation which excludes all
the information elements and errors which have been added since the MAP v(n-1)
specification;
\- vn-only package: An operation package which contains only vn-only
operations;
\- v(n-1)-package: An operation package which contains only v(n-1)-
operations.
The names of vn-packages are suffixed by \"-vn\" where n>=2.
For each operation package which is not vn-only (n>=2) and which does not
include only v(n-1)-operations, there is a v(n-1)-equivalent package. Except
when a definition is explicitly provided in the following clauses, the
v(n‑1)‑equivalent package includes the v(n-1)-equivalent operations of the
operations which belong to this package.
### 17.2.2 Packages specifications

## 17.3 Application contexts
### 17.3.1 General aspects
An application-context is assigned for each dialogue established by a MAP-
user. In the present document each application-context is assigned a name
which is supplied in the MAP-OPEN Req primitive by the MAP-User and
transmitted to the peer under certain circumstances.
The following ASN.1 information object class is used to describe the main
aspects of application-contexts in the following clauses:
APPLICATION-CONTEXT ::= CLASS {
&Symmetric OPERATION-PACKAGE OPTIONAL,
&InitiatorConsumerOf OPERATION-PACKAGE OPTIONAL,
&ResponderConsumerOf OPERATION-PACKAGE OPTIONAL,
&code OBJECT IDENTIFIER }
WITH SYNTAX {
[ OPERATIONS OF &Symmetric ]
[ INITIATOR CONSUMER OF &InitiatorConsumerOf
RESPONDER CONSUMER OF &ResponderConsumerOf ]
ID &code }
The following definitions are used throughout this clause:
\- v1-application-context: An application-context which contains only
v1-packages and uses only TC v1 facilities;
\- v1 context set: the set of v1-application-contexts defined in the present
document.
\- vn-application-context (n>=2): An application-context which contains only
vn-packages;
The names of v1-application-contexts are suffixed by \"-v1\" while other names
are suffixed by \"-vn\" where n>=2.
Application-contexts which do not belong to the v1 context set use v2 TC
facilities.
The last component of each application-context-name (i.e. the last component
of the object identifier value) assigned to an application-context which
belongs to the v1 context set indicates explicitly \"version1\".
For each application-context which does not belong to the \"v1 context set\"
there is a v1-equivalent application context. This is a v1-application-context
which includes the v1-equivalents of the packages included in the original
context.
Each application-context uses the abstract-syntax associated with the
operation-packages it includes and uses the transfer-syntax derived from it by
applying the encoding rules defined in clause 17.1.1.
ACs which do not belong to the v1 context set require the support of the
abstract-syntax identified by the object identifier value: MAP-
DialogueInformation.map-Dialogue-AS defined in clause 17.4.

Figure 18.2/1: Interfaces applicable to the MAP-User
### 18.2.3 Convention on primitives parameters
#### 18.2.3.1 Open service
When the originating and destination reference parameters shall be included in
the MAP-OPEN request primitive, their value are indicated as a comment to the
signal which represents this primitive.
#### 18.2.3.2 Close service
When a pre-arranged released is requested, a comment is attached to the signal
which represents the MAP-CLOSE request primitive. In the absence of comment, a
normal release is assumed.
### 18.2.4 Version handling at dialogue establishment
Unless explicitly indicated in subsequent clauses, the following principles
regarding version handling procedures at dialogue establishment are applied by
the MAP-user.
#### 18.2.4.1 Behaviour at the initiating side
When a MAP user signalling procedure has to be executed, the MAP-user issues a
MAP-OPEN request primitive with an appropriate application-context-name. If
several names are supported (i.e. several versions) a suitable one is selected
using the procedures described in clause 5.
If version n is selected (where 1 \1 the first forward message (Begin) must
contain a Dialogue Portion. Instead of sending the Dialogue Portion and the
Component Portion in the first forward message, an empty Begin (i.e. without a
Component Portion) is sent, followed (after successful dialogue establishment)
by a Continue message which can carry a longer Component Portion since no
Dialogue Portion is present in the second forward message.
### C.2.2 Empty Continue
In a dialogue with AC version >1 the first backward message (Continue / End)
must contain a Dialogue Portion. Instead of sending the Dialogue Portion and
the Component Portion in the first backward message, an empty Continue (i.e.
without a Component Portion) is sent, followed by a Continue/End message which
can carry a longer Component Portion since no Dialogue Portion is present in
the second backward message.
### C.2.3 TC-Result-NL
A Result component may be segmented into one or several Result-Not-Last
components followed by a Result-Last component. As specified in subclause
15.6.3, the MAP user parameter shall be split so that each segment is
compatible with the type defined for the parameter of the result of the
associated operation.
Note that this segmentation mechanism runs the risk that the message carrying
the Result-Last component arrives before the message carrying a Result-Not-
Last component which results in failure. The use of SCCP class 1 \"Sequence
guaranteed\", which raises the chance of in sequence delivery, is recommended.
## C.3 MAP Segmentation
At the MAP level the following segmentation mechanisms are available:
### C.3.1 Invoke without explicit indication
An Invoke component may be segmented into several Invoke components. These may
be sent in burst mode (in which case SCCP class 1 is recommended) or in
acknowledged mode. The receiving node does not get an indication of whether or
not more segments will be received, so it must not close the dialogue. The MAP
user parameter shall be split so that each segment is compatible with the type
defined for the parameter of the invoke of the associated operation.
### C.3.2 Invoke with explicit indication
An Invoke component may be segmented into several Invoke components sent in
acknowledged mode. Each component contains at the MAP level an indication of
whether or not subsequent components will follow. The receiving node
terminates the dialogue when the last component is received. The MAP user
parameter shall be split so that each segment is compatible with the type
defined for the parameter of the invoke of the associated operation.
### C.3.3 Result
A Result (last) component may be segmented into several Result (last)
components sent in acknowledged mode where a new (empty) Invoke component
serves as an acknowledgment. The last segment is not acknowledged. The MAP
user parameter shall be split so that each segment is compatible with the type
defined for the parameter of the result of the associated operation.
The following tables show the applicability of the mechanisms described above:

In the tables above the keywords \"recommended\", \"allowed\", \"risky\",
\"not recommended\", \"not allowed\" and \"n.a.\" are used as follows:
\"**recommended** \"\ indicates that the normative part of this specification
explicitly specifies the use of this mechanism for the parameter in question;
\"**allowed** \"\ indicates that the normative part of this specification
allows the use of this mechanism for the sending node and mandates support of
this mechanism for the receiving node;
\"**risky** \"\ indicates that the mechanism is \"allowed\".However, the use
of this mechanism for the parameter in question may result in serious
misoperation because SCCP transit nodes are not guaranteed to support XUDT
messages.
\"**not recommended** \"\ indicates that the normative part of this
specification does not explicitly specify the use of this mechanism for the
parameter in question.
\"**not allowed** \"\ indicates that the normative part of this specification
implicitly prohibits the use of this mechanism for the parameter in question.
\"**n.a.** \"\ indicates that the mechanism is not applicable for the
parameter in question.
