# 1 Scope
This Study item is to study:
1\. The addition of a S2a based on GTP option. In particular this SID will
develop the necessary stage 2 message flows to support S2a based on GTP and
mobility between GTP-S5/S8 and GTP-S2a.
2\. Supporting WLAN access to EPC through S2a via mechanisms:
2.1 with no impact to the UE;
2.2 with impact to the UE.
Solutions requiring modifications to non 3GPP link-layers will not be
considered. It is expected that the result of this Study Item may be used by
3GPP-BBF interworking activities (BBAI).

# 4 Scenarios
The decision on whether a non 3GPP access is considered trusted or un trusted
is made by the HPLMN operator and is not a characteristic of the non 3GPP
access network. More details on it are provided in clause 4.3.1.2 of TS 23.402
[3]. The HPMN operator however while making a decision on trust worthiness of
a non 3GPP access can also take into consideration security aspects of the
access network.
WLAN security was considered poor in both strength and ease of use, compared
with that taken for granted in 3G networks and devices (UICC plus HSS, and
GPRS encryption of data). Hence it made sense for the mobile network operators
(MNOs) to use their core network to add overlay security layers, i.e. the
IKEv2 for Authentication and Authorization of the UE, and the IPSec between
the UE and ePDG for the security of the user data.
Now, with the deployment of 802.1x, 802.11u, 802.11i and Hotspot 2.0, it may
be considered by some operators that the security strength and ease of use
(discovery and set up) is as acceptable as 3G/LTE security. For example, for
the radio air link, the operator controlled hotspot with 802.11i could be
treated as a secure Non-3GPP Access. As 802.11i (or WPA2 called by WFA) has
been released for several years, many AP-s support it as a basic feature and
lots of smart phones also have supported it.
WLAN can also be deployed integrated in a residential/enterprise device (e.g.
femto). In such a scenario, protection mechanism for the traffic on the
backhaul link between the residential/enterprise device and the EPC may be
used. This protection of the backhaul may be leveraged to consider the WLAN
security in terms of connectivity to the EPC.
The impact on the support of the following scenarios shall be used to evaluate
the solutions that will be proposed in the study:
\- Access to EPC resources/services with access control by the operator;
\- Seamless mobility between 3GPP and WLAN for EPS services with IP address
preservation;
\- Non-seamless mobility services between 3GPP and WLAN for EPS services: no
IP address preservation;
\- Support of UEs with single PDN connection; support of UEs with multiple PDN
connections;
\- Access to EPC via WLAN simultaneously with non-seamless WLAN offload.
# 5 Architectural assumptions
Editor\'s note: This clause will identify the architectural assumptions.
## 5.1 Architectural assumptions for GTP based S2a
From a UE perspective, using S2a-GTP or S2a-PMIP shall be transparent.
The impacts to the existing functionalities and to the EPC shall be minimized.
The protocol design on S2a should aim at keeping S2a GTP operations similar to
those supported on GTP-based S5/S8 and GTP-based S2b as much as possible.
All functions of the existing PMIP-S2a option should also be supported by
GTP-S2a, except for optimized handover.
## 5.2 Architectural assumptions for WLAN access to EPC through S2a
In order to support the scenarios described in section 4, the following
assumptions for WLAN access to EPC through S2a are taken and need to be
investigated as part of the study:
\- The UE and the EPC are assumed to mutually authenticate through the WLAN
Access as defined in TS 23.402 [3], clause 4.9.1.
\- It is assumed that UE traffic over the WLAN air link may be confidentiality
and integrity protected as defined by IEEE 802.11 [5].
\- It is assumed that there is a point-to-point link between UE and non-3GPP
access GTP peer for the solutions with no impact to UE.
The backhaul, through which WLAN accesses to EPC, may be secured, e.g. through
IPSec, to build a secure access to the EPC.
### 5.2.1 Assumptions for solutions with no Impact to the UE
The solutions that enable trusted WLAN access to EPC over S2a without any UE
impact shall comply with the following architectural assumptions:
\- There shall be no functionality added to a R11 UE with respect to a R10 or
pre-R10 UE specifically for the support of trusted WLAN access to EPC over
S2a.
\- No additional 3GPP mechanisms (other than those already specified), layer 2
protocol modifications or layer 3 protocol modifications shall be required on
the UE to allow a UE capable of WLAN connectivity to a trusted WLAN network to
gain WLAN access to EPC through S2a.
\- There shall be no impact to the UE for the indication of the APN of the PDN
to be established upon attach or upon handover of a PDN connection from a 3GPP
access to trusted WLAN through S2a. The network shall be capable of selecting
the APN to be used for the PDN establishment upon attach, independently of
whether one or more PDN connections with such APNs are active over a 3GPP
access.
\- There shall be no impact to the UE for the support of IP address
preservation in case of mobility between a 3GPP access and WLAN.
\- There shall be no impact to the UE for the establishment of more than one
PDN connections over WLAN when attaching to WLAN access or when handing over
PDN connections from a 3GPP access.
\- There shall be no impact to the UE for the simultaneous support of IP
connectivity to the EPC over WLAN and with non-seamless WLAN offload.
\- SaMOG solution should co-exist with Release 11 and earlier UEs which may
implement WLAN interworking related features including ANDSF and its
extensions, SWu, S2c.
\- Since an unmodified UE may support the Detecting Network Attachment (DNA)
functions, solutions claiming no impacts to the UE shall work in presence of
the following protocols:
\- For IPv4: IETF RFC 4436 [13]
\- For IPv6: IETF RFC 6059 [14]
The above list is non-exhaustive.
Only the following functions can be considered supported by an unmodified UE,
i.e. solutions with no impacts to UE shall only expect the following functions
in the UE:
\- WLAN spec only restricted to PHY/MAC aspects in IEEE 802.11 [5] and IEEE
802.11n [15]
\- 3GPP-based authentication as defined in TS 23.402 [3] over WLAN (i.e.
access authentication towards EPC)
\- IPv4 and/or IPv6 support:
\- For IPv4: IETF RFC791 [8], IETF RFC 2131 [9]
\- For IPv6: IETF RFC 2460 [10], IETF RFC 4861 [11], and IETF RFC 4862 [12]
# 6 Solutions for GTP based S2a
Editor\'s note: This clause will describe the solution(s) for the \"access
agnostic\" GTP-S2a, which is basically similar to PMIPv6-S2a in TS 23.402 [3].
For WLAN Access, the additional considerations including the potential UE
impacts are studied in clause 7.
## 6.1 Solution 1
### 6.1.1 Architecture
The same architecture reference models as those defined in TS 23.402 [3] can
be applied to GTP based S2a, with the following differences:
\- BBERF is not required with GTP based S2a;
\- Gxa interface is not required between the PCRF (or vPCRF) and the Trusted
Non-3GPP Access;
\- vPCRF (and S9 interface) is not required for roaming with Home Routed
traffic (i.e. non-LBO traffic).
NOTE 1: The Chained case is not proposed to be supported in this
release.Figures 6.1.1-1 to 6.1.1-3 show the baseline architecture reference
model for GTP based S2a in the non roaming and roaming cases.
Figure 6.1.1-1: Non-Roaming Architecture within EPS using GTP based S5, S2a
Figure 6.1.1-2: Roaming Architecture for EPS using GTP based S8, S2a - Home
Routed
Figure 6.1.1-3: Roaming Architecture for EPS using GTP based S5, S2a -- Local
Breakout
NOTE 2: A GTP peer is assumed in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access for this GTP
based S2a. Moreover it is assumed that the GTP peer acts as first hop router
in a similar way as the MAG when PMIP is used over S2a. When deferred IPv4
address allocation is supported, it is assumed that the GTP peer supports
DHCPv4 relay functionality.
### 6.1.2 Functional description
Editor\'s note: This clause will contain the functional description for S2a
mobility based on GTP.
#### 6.1.2.1 Bearer model for a PDN connection
Figure 6.1.2.1-1: Bearer model on GTP based S2a
NOTE: The mapping between Non-3GPP connectivity and multiple GTP bearers in
the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access is out of 3GPP scope.
For Trusted non-3GPP access to the EPC, the PDN connectivity is made up of the
concatenation of Non-3GPP connectivity (between the UE and the Trusted
Non-3GPP access) and of GTP bearer(s) over S2a.
The GTP based S2a interface is similar to GTP-S5/S8 and GTP-S2b. The Trusted
Non 3GPP access handles the UL TFT received from the PGW over GTP with the
same way as an ePDG terminating GTP based S2b handles the UL TFT received from
the PGW.
Whether GTP or PMIP is used in the network for S2a is transparent to the UE.
### 6.1.3 Information flows
#### 6.1.3.1 Initial Attach Procedure with GTP on S2a and Anchoring in PDN GW
NOTE 1: The exact list of parameters signalled in GTP S2a information flows
will be defined during normative work.
Figure 6.1.3.1-1: Initial attachment with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a
for roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios
Principles are similar to those specified for the PMIPv6 S2a call flow in
clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3], but with GTP signalling and following
differences:
The home routed roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios are depicted in the
figure 6.1.3.1-1.
\- In the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding
messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and
vice versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the
HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
\- In the home routed roaming and non-roaming cases, the vPCRF and the 3GPP
AAA Proxy are not involved, except for the authentication and authorization in
step 2.
1) as for step 1 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3].
2) as for step 2 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3], with the following
additions:
\- Upon successful authorization, the 3GPP AAA server downloads authorization
(subscription) data to the Trusted non-3GPP Access. This information is used
at step 5.
\- The Trusted non 3GPP IP Access selects the S2a protocol variant (GTP vs
PMIP). The Trusted non 3GPP IP Access may be configured with the S2a protocol
variant(s) on a per HPLMN granularity, or may retrieve information regarding
the S2a protocol variants supported by the PDN GW (PMIP or/and GTP) from the
Domain Name Service function.
\- The Trusted non-3GPP IP Access selects the PGW as per the existing PGW
selection procedure; if the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access receives a PGW Identity
under the form of a FQDN, it shall derive it to an IP address according to the
selected mobility management protocol (here GTP).
NOTE 2: As per existing principles, to support separate PDN GW addresses at a
PDN GW for different mobility protocols (e.g. PMIP, MIPv4 or GTPv2), the PDN
GW Selection function takes mobility protocol type into account when deriving
PDN GW address by using the Domain Name Service function.
3) as for step 3 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3].
NOTE 3: Only when IPv4, the L3 trigger may be relayed to the PDN GW after the
GTP tunnel has been setup in step 9 using deferred IPv4 address mechanism.
4) step 4 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3] is skipped.
5) The Trusted non-3GPP IP Access sends a Create Session Request (IMSI, APN,
RAT type, Trusted non-3GPP IP Access TEID of the control plane, PDN Type, PDN
Address, EPS Bearer Identity, Default EPS Bearer QoS, Trusted non-3GPP IP
Access Address for the user plane, Trusted non-3GPP IP Access TEID of the user
plane, APN-AMBR, Selection Mode, Dual Address Bearer Flag, Trace Information,
Charging Characteristics, Protocol Configuration Options) message to the PGW.
The RAT type indicates the non-3GPP IP access technology type. The PDN Type
shall be set based on the requested IP address types and subscription profile
in the same way as the PDN type is selected during the Eâ€‘UTRAN Initial Attach
in TS 23.401 [6]. The Trusted non-3GPP IP Access Network shall set the Dual
Address Bearer Flag when the PDN type is set to IPv4v6 and all SGSNs which the
UE may be handed over to are Release 8 or above supporting dual addressing,
which is determined based on node pre-configuration by the operator. The
Trusted non-3GPP IP Access Network shall include Trace Information if PDN GW
trace is activated.
The PGW creates a new entry in its bearer context table and generates a
Charging Id. The new entry allows the PGW to route user plane PDUs between the
Trusted non-3GPP IP Access Network and the packet data network and to start
charging.
NOTE 4: The EPS Bearer Identity and Default EPS Bearer QoS parameters convey
the S2a bearer identity and the default S2a bearer QoS.
NOTE 5: As part of the access specific study it will be clarified whether step
5 (Create Session Request) is triggered by the completion of the
authentication procedure (step 2) either/or by the reception of the L3 Attach
trigger (step 3).
6) as for step 6 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3] except that there is no
associated Gateway Control Sessions.
7) as for step 7 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3], with the following
addition:
\- when informing the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity, the selected PDN
GW also indicates the selected S2a protocol variant (here GTP); this allows
the option for the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy not to return to the PDN
GW PMIP specific parameters (e.g. static QoS Profile, Trace Information, APN-
AMBR) if GTP is used over S2a; the PDN GW shall ignore those parameters if
received from the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy.
8) The PDN GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the user
plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control plane, PDN
Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR, Protocol
Configuration Options, Cause) message to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access,
including the IP address(es) allocated for the UE.
NOTE 6: If the L3 attach trigger is relayed to the PDN GW, the IP address will
not be returned in the Create Session Response.
The PGW may initiate the creation of dedicated bearers on GTP based S2a (like
it may do it on GTP based S5/S8 for an Attach on 3GPP access).
9) The GTP tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN
GW.
NOTE 7: If the L3 Attach trigger is relayed to the PDN GW, the DCHP request is
sent to the PDN GW in the established GTP tunnel.
> 10) step 10 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3] is skipped.
>
> 11) as for step 11 of clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3].
#### 6.1.3.2 Detach and PDN Disconnection with GTP on S2a
##### 6.1.3.2.1 UE/Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access Network Initiated Detach and
UE/Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access requested PDN Disconnection Procedure with GTP
on S2a
Figure 6.1.3.2.1-1: UE/Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach
procedure or PDN-disconnection with GTP on S2a
Principles are similar to those specified for the PMIP S2a call flow in clause
6.4.1.1 of TS 23.402 [3], but with GTP signalling:
1) as for step 1 of clause 6.4.1.1 of TS 23.402 3].
2) step 2 of clause 6.4.1.1 of TS 23.402 [3] is skipped.
3) The active Bearer(s) Trusted non-3GPP IP Access regarding this particular
UE and PDN connection are deactivated by the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access
sending a Delete Session Request (Linked EPS Bearer ID) to the PGW for the
related PDN connection.
4 to 5) as for steps 4 to 5 of clause 6.4.1.1 of TS 23.402 [3].
6) The PDN GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause).
7) as for step 7 of clause 6.4.1.1 of TS 23.402 [3].
##### 6.1.3.2.2 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach Procedure with GTP on S2a
Figure 6.1.3.2.2-1: HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with GTP on S2a
Principles are similar to those specified for the PMIP S2a call flow in clause
6.4.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3], but with GTP signalling:
1) as for step 1 of clause 6.4.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3].
2) This includes the procedures after step 1 as for Figure 6.1.3.2.1-1.
For multiple PDN connectivity, this step shall be repeated for each PDN
connected.
3) as for step 3 of clause 6.4.2.1 of TS 23.402 [3].
NOTE: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW. The
PDN GW does not remove the GTP tunnels on S2a, since the Trusted non-3GPP IP
Access is responsible for removing those tunnels on S2a. The PDN GW
acknowledges the receipt of the detach indication message to the HSS/AAA.
#### 6.1.3.3 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with GTP on S2a
Establishment of connectivity to an additional PDN over Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access with S2a is supported only for the accesses that support such feature
and the UEs that have such capability.
During the establishment of a new PDN connection, the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access allocates and sends a default EPS bearer ID to the PDN GW. The default
EPS bearer ID is unique in the scope of the UE within an Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access, i.e. the IMSI and the default EPS bearer ID together identify a PDN
connection within an Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access. In order to be able to
identify a specific established PDN connection, both the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access and the PDN GW shall store the default EPS bearer ID.
For network supporting multiple mobility protocols, the AAA/HSS enforces the
same IPMS decision for each additional PDN connection as for initial attach.
Figure 6.1.3.3-1: Additional PDN connectivity with GTP on S2a for non-roaming
and roaming
The steps in the procedure which are marked as optional occur only if dynamic
policy provisioning has been deployed.
The home routed roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios are depicted in the
figure 6.1.3.3-1.
\- In the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding
messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and
vice versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the
HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
\- In the home routed roaming and non-roaming cases, the vPCRF and the 3GPP
AAA Proxy are not involved.
1) When the UE wishes to connect to an additional PDN, it sends a trigger
indicating that connectivity with that specific PDN is desired. The UE
provides information about the new PDN by using an APN. When multiple PDN
connections to a single APN are supported then some additional access specific
mechanism is needed between the UE and the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access to
differentiate the PDN connections towards the same APN. If supported by the
non-3GPP access, the UE may send Protocol Configuration Options in this step
using access specific mechanisms. The Protocol Configuration Options provided
by the UE may include the user credentials for PDN access authorization. The
UE triggers the re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the
handover by providing a Request Type indicating \"Handover\" on accesses that
support the indication.
NOTE 1: The definition of the trigger that the UE provides to the access
network is out of scope of 3GPP.
2) At this step the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access performs PDN GW selection as
described in Steps 5 to 9 of Initial Attach procedure, while PDN GW2 is
selected.
3) The Trusted non-3GPP IP Access sends the reply message to the UE with the
allocated IP address from the PDN that the UE indicated at step 1. If
supported by the non-3GPP access, the Protocol Configuration Options provided
by the PDN GW2 in step 2 are returned to the UE in this step using access
specific mechanisms. Since UE requested for additional PDN connectivity, the
UE configures the IP address received from the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access
without deleting its configuration for connectivity with any other previously
established PDN.
NOTE 2: The definition of the message used to carry the new connectivity
information to the UE is out of scope of 3GPP.
4) The GTP tunnel is thus set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and
the PDN GW corresponding to the requested additional PDN while maintaining
tunnels previously established for other PDNs.
#### 6.1.3.4 Dedicated bearer activation with GTP on S2a
The dedicated bearer activation procedure for GTP based S2a is depicted in
figure 6.1.3.4-1.
Figure 6.1.3.4-1: Dedicated S2a Bearer Activation Procedure with GTP on S2a
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS
policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the initial steps of the
PCRF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure or to the PCRF response
in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS
23.203 [4], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP CAN Bearer Signalling.
If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS policy.
2\. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to assign the S2a bearer QoS, i.e., it
assigns the values to the bearer level QoS parameters QCI, ARP, GBR and MBR.
The PDN GW sends a Create Bearer Request message (IMSI, EPS bearer QoS, TFT,
PDN GW Address for the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, Charging Id,
LBI) to the trusted non-3GPP access. The Linked EPS bearer Identity (LBI) is
the EPS bearer Identity of the default S2a bearer.
3\. If supported by the trusted non-3GPP access, a trusted non-3GPP access
specific resource allocation/modification procedure may be executed in this
step. The details of this step are out of the scope of 3GPP.
4\. The trusted non-3GPP access selects an EPS bearer Identity, which has not
yet been assigned to the UE. The trusted non-3GPP access then stores the EPS
bearer Identity and links the dedicated S2a bearer to the default S2a bearer
indicated by the Linked Bearer Identity (LBI). The trusted non-3GPP access
uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to determine the mapping of uplink
traffic flows to the S2a bearer. The trusted non-3GPP access then acknowledges
the S2a bearer activation to the PGW by sending a Create Bearer Response (EPS
bearer Identity, trusted non-3GPP access Address for the user plane, trusted
non-3GPP access TEID of the user plane) message.
5\. If the dedicated bearer activation procedure was triggered by a PCC
Decision Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF
whether the requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or not,

#### 6.1.3.5 Network-initiated S2a bearer modification with GTP on S2a
##### 6.1.3.5.1 PDN GW Initiated Bearer Modification
The PDN GW initiated bearer modification procedure for a GTP based S2a is
depicted in figure 6.1.3.5.1-1. This procedure is used to update the TFT for
an active default or dedicated S2a bearer, or in cases when one or several of
the S2a bearer QoS parameters QCI, GBR, MBR or ARP are modified (including the
QCI or the ARP of the default S2a bearer e.g. due to the HSS Initiated
Subscribed QoS Modification procedure, as described in clause 6.1.3.5.2).
Figure 6.1.3.5.1-1: PDN GW-initiated S2a Bearer Modification Procedure with
GTP on S2a
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS
policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the initial steps of the
PCRF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure or to the PCRF response
in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [4], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP-CAN Bearer
Signalling. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS
policy.
2\. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to determine that a service data flow
shall be aggregated to or removed from an active S2a bearer or that the
authorized QoS of a service data flow has changed. The PDN GW generates the
TFT and updates the S2a bearer QoS to match the traffic flow aggregate. The
PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request (EPS bearer Identity, EPS bearer
QoS, TFT) message to the trusted non-3GPP IP access.
3\. If supported by the trusted non-3GPP access, an IP-CAN specific resource
allocation or resource release procedure may be triggered by the enforcement
of the received policy rules. The details of this step are out of the scope of
3GPP.
4\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to
determine the mapping of traffic flows to the S2a bearer and acknowledges the
S2a bearer modification to the PGW by sending an Update Bearer Response (EPS
bearer Identity) message.
5\. If the Bearer modification procedure was triggered by a PCC Decision
Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the
requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or not by sending a
Provision Ack message allowing the completion of the PCRF-Initiated IP CAN
Session Modification procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session
Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203 [4], after the completion of IP
CAN bearer signalling.
NOTE: The exact signalling of step 1 and 5 (e.g. for local break-out) is
outside the scope of this TR. This signalling and its interaction with the
bearer activation procedure are to be specified in TS 23.203 [4]. Step 1 and 5
are included here only for completeness.
##### 6.1.3.5.2 HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification
The HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification for a GTP-based S2a is depicted
in figure 6.1.3.5.2-1.
Figure 6.1.3.5.2-1: HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification
1\. The HSS updates the User Profile as specified in clause 12.2.1 of TS
23.402[3].
2\. If the QCI and/or ARP and/or subscribed APN-AMBR has been modified and
there is a related active PDN connection with the modified QoS Profile, the
trusted non-3GPP IP access sends the Modify Bearer Command (EPS bearer
Identity, EPS bearer QoS, APN AMBR) message to the PDN GW. The EPS bearer
Identity identifies the default bearer of the affected PDN connection. The EPS
bearer QoS contains the EPS subscribed QoS profile to be updated.
3\. If PCC infrastructure is deployed, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the
updated EPS bearer QoS. The PCRF sends the new updated PCC decision to the PDN
GW. This corresponds to the PCEF-initiated IP CAN Session Modification
procedure as defined in TS 23.203 [4].
The PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and the QoS parameters (QCI and ARP)
associated with the default bearer in the response to the PDN GW as defined in
TS 23.203 [4].
4\. The PDN GW modifies the default bearer of each PDN connection
corresponding to the APN for which subscribed QoS has been modified. If the
subscribed ARP parameter has been changed, the PDN GW shall also modify all
dedicated S2a bearers having the previously subscribed ARP value unless
superseded by PCRF decision. The PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request
(EPS bearer Identity, EPS bearer QoS, TFT, APN AMBR) message to the trusted
non-3GPP IP access.
5\. If supported by the trusted non-3GPP access, an IP-CAN specific procedure
may be triggered by the enforcement of the received policy rules. The details
of this step are out of the scope of 3GPP.
6\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access acknowledges the bearer modification to the
PDN GW by sending an Update Bearer Response (EPS bearer Identity) message. If
the bearer modification fails the PDN GW deletes the concerned S2a Bearer.
7\. The PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was
enforced or not by sending a Provision Ack message.
#### 6.1.3.6 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with GTP on S2a
This procedure depicted in figure 6.1.3.6-1 can be used to deactivate a
dedicated bearer or deactivate all bearers belonging to a PDN address, for
e.g., due to IP CAN session modification requests from the PCRF or due to
handover from Non-3GPP to 3GPP access. If the default bearer belonging to a
PDN connection is deactivated, the PDN GW deactivates all bearers belonging to
the PDN connection.
When it is performed for a handover, the connections associated with the PDN
address are released, but the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.
Figure 6.1.3.6-1: PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation with GTP on S2a
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Roaming and Local Breakout cases.
In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and
the hPCRF. In the non-roaming and home routed roaming cases, the vPCRF is not
involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the PDN GW and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 6.1.3.6-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured within the PDN GW.
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Bearer Deactivation
procedure may for example be triggered due to \'IP CAN session Modification
procedure\', as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]. In this case, the resources
associated with the PDN connection in the PDN GW are released.
The PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation can also be triggered
during handovers from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.
2\. The PDN GW sends a Delete Bearer Request message (EPS Bearer Identity,
Cause) to the trusted non-3GPP IP access.
3\. If supported by the trusted non-3GPP access, the Non 3GPP specific
resources may be released in the non-3GPP IP access. The details of this step
are out of the scope of 3GPP.
4\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access deletes the bearer contexts related to the
Delete Bearer Request, and acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the PDN GW
by sending a Delete Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity) message.
5\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are
released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server/HSS of the PDN
disconnection. If this is the last PDN connection for the given APN, the PDN
GW identity information and APN corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection is
removed from the AAA Server/HSS. This information is de-registered from the
HSS as described in TS 23.402 [3].
6\. The PDN GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated EPS
bearer. If the dedicated bearer deactivation procedure was triggered by
receiving a PCC decision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the
PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was successfully enforced by
completing the PCRF-initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure or the
PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203
[4], proceeding after the completion of IP CAN bearer signalling.
#### 6.1.3.7 Handovers without Optimizations Between 3GPP Accesses and
Non-3GPP IP Accesses with S2a GTP
##### 6.1.3.7.1 Handover from a trusted non-3GPP IP access with S2a GTP to
3GPP Access
The handover procedure from a trusted non-3GPP IP access using GTP S2a to
E-UTRAN access using GTP S5/S8 connected to EPC is similar to the procedure
specified in TS 23.402 [3], clause 8.2.1.1, except that:
\- at step 1, the tunnel between trusted non-3GPP access and the PGW is a GTP
tunnel;
\- at step 7, the PDN GW may create dedicated bearers during this procedure.
\- at step 18, the PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation
procedure in the trusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.1.3.6 PDN
GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with GTP on S2a.
Figure 6.1.3.7.1-1: Handover from Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with GTP on S2a
to E-UTRAN
The handover procedure from a trusted non-3GPP IP access using GTP S2a to
UTRAN/GERAN access using GTP S5/S8 connected to EPC is similar to the
procedure specified in TS 23.402 [3], clause 8.2.1.3, except that:
\- at step 1, the tunnel between trusted non-3GPP access and the PGW is a GTP
tunnel;
\- at step 10, the PDN GW may create dedicated bearers during this procedure.
\- at step 17, the PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation
procedure in the trusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.1.3.6 PDN
GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with GTP on S2a.
Figure 6.1.3.7.1-2: Handover from Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with GTP on S2a
to UTRAN/GERAN
##### 6.1.3.7.2 Handover from 3GPP Access to a trusted non-3GPP IP access with
S2a GTP
NOTE 1: This procedure is based on TS 23.402 [3], clause 8.2.2. Only the
differences are described below.
Figure 6.1.3.7.2-1: Handover from 3GPP Access to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access
with GTP on S2a
1-4) Same as step 1-4 in TS 23.402 [3] clause 8.2.2 except that at step 1, the
tunnel between Serving GW and the PGW may be both a GTP or a PMIP tunnel.
5) The entity in the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access sends Create Session Request
(IMSI, APN, Handover Indication, RAT type, Trusted non-3GPP IP Access TEID of
the control plane, Trusted non-3GPP IP Access Address for the user plane,
Trusted non-3GPP IP Access TEID of the user plane, EPS Bearer Identity)
message to the PDN GW. The RAT type indicates the non-3GPP IP access
technology type. If the UE supports IP address preservation and included the
address in early steps, the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access sets the \'Handover
Indication\' in the Creation Session Request to allow the PDN GW to re-
allocate the same IP address or prefix that was assigned to the UE while it
was connected to the 3GPP IP access and to initiate a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN
Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF.
NOTE 2: With GTP on S2a, APN, IMSI and EPS Bearer ID identifies a PDN
connection over GTP based S2a.
NOTE 3: With GTP on S2a, there is no relation between the values of the EPS
bearer identities used within 3GPP networks and non-3GPP networks.
NOTE 4: In a non-3GPP to 3GPP access handover, the \'Handover Indication\'
leads the PDN GW to delay switching the DL user plane traffic from non-3GPP to
3GPP until a subsequent Modify Bearer Request is received. In a 3GPP to
non-3GPP handover scenario with GTP based S2a, the \'Handover Indication\'
should not delay the switching of DL user plane traffic from 3GPP to non-3GPP
access.
6A-6B) Same as steps 7A and 7B in TS 23.402 [3] clause 8.2.2 with following
additions:
\- at step 8, the PDN GW may create dedicated bearers during this procedure.
7) The PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the
user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control plane,
PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR, Charging
ID, Cause) message to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access. The Create Session
Response contains the IP address and/or the prefix that was assigned to the UE
while it was connected to the 3GPP IP access.
8-11) Same as step 9-12 in TS 23.402 [3] clause 8.2.2, except that at step 12,
the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401
[6], clause 5.4.4.1.
# 7 Additional considerations for WLAN access to EPC through S2a for Phase 1
## 7.1 Solutions without UE Impact
### 7.1.0 General
1) Multiple PDN connections in the WLAN access
Since the support of multiple PDN connections in the WLAN access would require
the UE to signal the APN, a solution without UE impact only considers a single
PDN connection in WLAN. This does not preclude multiple PDN connections
through 3GPP and WLAN as long as there is only one PDN connection using WLAN
access.
2) Mobility aspects
A solution without any impact to the UE only considers mobility without IP
address preservation: the preservation on WLAN of the IP address the UE used
on the 3GPP access would require changes in existing UEs as it is not
specified in current 3GPP specifications.
NOTE: The security considerations of the internal WLAN-based trusted non-3GPP
access network architecture are outside the scope of this study item.
### 7.1.1 Solution 1
#### 7.1.1.1 Reference model
When the WLAN is considered as trusted by the operator, the WLAN AN is
interfaced as any trusted non-3GPP access i.e. via STa to the 3GPP AAA Server
and via S2a to a PDN-GW. EPC access via Trusted WLAN is supported through S2a
interface. A single SSID offering simultaneous access for a UE to EPC through
S2a and non-seamless offload is not supported. Non-seamless offload may
however be supported in some deployments (e.g. with separate SSIDs for non-
seamless offload and access to EPC through S2a via Wireless LAN, see clause
7.1.1.4).
The reference model is depicted in the following figure.
Figure 7.1.1.1-1: Non-roaming Trusted WLAN Inter-working reference model
Figure 7.1.1.1-2: Home Routed Roaming Trusted WLAN Inter-working reference
model
Figure 7.1.1.1-3: Local Breakout Roaming Trusted WLAN Inter-working reference
model
Within the trusted non-3GPP IP access network (TNAN) we distinguish three
functions:
\- A WLAN Access Network (WLAN AN). This function terminates the UE\'s WiFi
air link defined in IEEE 802.11 [5].
\- A Trusted non-3GPP access\'s S2a peer (TNSP). This function terminates S2a.
\- A Trusted non-3GPP access\'s STa peer (TNAP). This function terminates STa.
NOTE 1: Policy and QoS aspects are studied as part of BBAI.
NOTE 2: Whether multiple TNAN functions are mapped to a single non-3GPP access
entity, or a single TNAN function is distributed among multiple non-3GPP
access entities is out-of-scope of 3GPP.
**STa reference point**
The STa reference point is defined in TS 23.402 [3] and specified in TS 29.273
[7]. It connects the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access with the 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy
and transports access authentication, authorization, mobility parameters and
charging-related information in a secure manner.
STa might need to be enhanced to support:
\- A way for the Trusted WLAN Access Network to provide the AAA server with
following information:
\- An indication on whether the Trusted WLAN AN supports S2a, non-seamless
offload or both;
NOTE 3: Stage 3 discussions will determine whether existing \"Mobility
Capabilities\" over STa may be reused for that purpose.
\- The SSID selected by the UE to access the Trusted WLAN AN.
\- A way for the AAA server to provide the Trusted WLAN Access Network with
following information:
\- The APN the user is to be associated with for EPC access; this is required
for the Trusted WLAN Access Network to establish the PDN connection with the
PDN GW. Based on the HPLMN operator configuration the HSS may provide the 3GPP
AAA server with a default APN for Trusted WLAN Access Network.
NOTE 4: Stage 3 discussions will determine whether existing \"Default APN\"
over STa may be reused for that purpose.
\- Whether access to EPC is allowed for the UE.
NOTE 5: Stage 3 discussions will determine whether existing \"Mobility
Capabilities\" over STa may be reused for that purpose.
\- The UE IMSI; this is required for the Trusted WLAN Access Network to build
the S2a messages towards the PDN-GW.
NOTE 6: Stage 3 discussions will determine whether existing \"Permanent User
Identity\" over STa may be reused for that purpose.
**SWw reference point**
The SWw reference point connects the WLAN UE to the WLAN Access Network
according to IEEE 802.11 [5]. This includes the support of:
\- the security that was defined as part of 802.11-2007 [5] and thus the
transport of EAP signalling messages for authentication signalling between the
3GPP AAA Server and the WLAN UE;
\- parameters for identification of the operator networks for roaming purposes
(i.e. PLMN list).
**SWx reference point**
The SWx reference point is defined for EPC in TS 23.402 [3]. It is specified
at stage 3 level respectively in TS 29.273 [7].
#### 7.1.1.2 Initial Attach Procedure with GTP on S2a and Anchoring in PDN GW
Figure 7.1.1.2-1: Initial attachment with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a
for roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios
A per-UE point-to-point link between UE and TNSP is assumed. In particular, it
is assumed that the trusted non-3GPP access does not do any routing of UE
traffic between WLAN AN and TNSP. It is assumed that the WLAN AN applies
upstream and downstream forced-forwarding between the UE\'s WiFi air link and
the WLAN AN -TNSP link. The aspects of point-to-point link described in IETF
RFC 5213 [17] and IETF RFC 5844 [18] also applies to the point-to-point link
between UE and TNSP. The implementation of the point-to-point link is out-of-
scope for 3GPP.
In this specific solution, it is assumed that TNSP is the first hop router and
the DHCP server.
NOTE 1: The link model is different from GTP based S5/S8 and GTP based S2b.
No specific mechanisms are defined to support AP-to-AP handover.
Refer to clause 6.1.3.1. Based on assumptions for solutions with no impact to
UE, UE cannot provide APN and PCO to TNSP. So, there are following differences
than clause 6.1.3.1:
\- At step 2, the following additions apply:
\- The HSS provide APN information to the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access in the
subscription data. HSS provides a default APN for WLAN. PDN type is indicated
from HSS in this step. Based on the HPLMN operator configuration the HSS may
provide the 3GPP AAA server with a default APN for Trusted WLAN Access
Network.
NOTE 2: If the APN used in 3GPP side is the same as the default APN for
Trusted WLAN the network may select the same or different PDN GWs for the PDN
connections when PDN connections to this APN are activated via 3GPP access
network and Trusted WLAN in the same time. If the same PDN GW is selected then
the APN-AMBR is enforced for the PDN connections. If different PDN GWs are
selected then the APN-AMBR is enforced separately in the PDN GWs for the PDN
connections, i.e. the UE will receive double amount of bandwidth for the APN.
Therefore it is recommended that the default APN for Trusted WLAN access be
different from any APN that the UE may use on the 3GPP side.
\- The UE and the EPC are mutually authenticated through the WLAN Access as
defined in TS 23.402 [3] clause 4.9.1.
\- IEEE 802.1X as defined by IEEE 802.11 [5] is used over the WLAN air link to
carry EAP.
\- After EAP authentication, UE traffic over the WLAN air link may be
confidentiality and integrity protected as defined by IEEE 802.11 [5].
\- The TNAN may indicate to the AAA server via STa whether it supports S2a,
non-seamless offload or both. The HSS/AAA may indicate via STa whether access
to EPC via S2a is or is not allowed for this subscriber. The HSS/AAA decision
to allow EPC access or not could be based on information elements such as
subscriber profile, access network, SSID selected.
\- At step3, For IPv4 address configuration, the use of DHCPv4 as in IETF RFC
5844 [18] is the L3 attach trigger.
\- At step 3, For IPv6 address configuration, the use of RS as in IETF RFC
5213 [17] or LL-DAD NS is the L3 attach trigger. The TNSP does not send RAs
until an L3 attach trigger is received.
NOTE 3: It is assumed that, to identify the UE, the L3 triggers are
transported in an L2 frame that contains the UE L2 address (MAC address).
\- The TNAN determines based on HSS/AAA indication or pre-configured
information whether or not to establish S2a.
\- If the TNAN determined that S2a shall not be used steps 5-9 are skipped.
Instead, the TNAN assigns an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix to the UE
(depending on the trigger received in step 3) and offloads the traffic.
\- At step 5, when TNSP receives L3 attach trigger message, the TNSP selects
default APN according the subscription data received in step 2. If the L3
attach trigger is of an IP version not supported by the subscription PDN Type,
the TNSP does not send Create Session Request. Otherwise, the TNSP sends a
Create Session Request with the PDN Type of the subscription data:
\- If the L3 attach trigger is IPv4 and step 2 indicates that PDN type IPv4v6
is supported for the default APN, then PDN type in the Create Session Request
is set to IPv4v6. If the UE also performs an IPv6 L3 attach trigger, then the
TNSP will correlate both requests to the same PDN connection.
\- If the L3 attach trigger is IPv6, and step 2 indicates that PDN type IPv4v6
is supported for the default APN, then PDN type in the Create Session Request
is set to IPv4v6. If the UE also performs an IPv4 L3 attach trigger, then the
TNSP will correlate both requests to the same PDN connection.
\- If the L3 attach trigger is IPv4, and step 2 indicates that PDN type is
IPv4-only, then PDN type in the Create Session Request is set to IPv4.
\- If the L3 attach trigger is IPv6, and step 2 indicates that PDN type is
IPv6-only, then PDN type in the Create Session Request is set to IPv6.
\- At step 8, PDN GW sends Create Session Response to the TNSP.
\- At step 11, for IPv4, a DHCPv4 message with allocated IPv4 address is sent.
For IPv6, the TNSP starts sending RAs with the allocated prefix and sets
\"autonomous address configuration\" flag and \"O\" flag [RFC 4861].
NOTE 4: A UE might request to get some IP configuration parameters (e.g. DNS
server) by means of DHCP. These parameters sent by TNSP(acting as a DHCP
server) to the UE in a DHCP reply. These parameters are retrieved by the
TNSP(acting as a DHCP client) from the PGW by means of DHCP.
#### 7.1.1.3 Without-UE-impact procedures except Initial Attach
Based on the GTP-S2a procedures in Section 6, for the solution without UE
impact the following procedures are considered:
\- Detach and PDN Disconnection with GTP on S2a:
\- Trusted WLAN AN and HSS/AAA may disconnect the PDN Connection and detach
the UE, and the PDN GW may initiate Resource Allocation Deactivation for the
default bearer as the PDN disconnection. If there is no traffic received from
the UE for a configurable duration and the WLAN AN detects the UE has left
based on unanswered probes (e.g. ARP Request, Neighbour Solicitation message),
it disconnects the PDN Connection. In these cases the UE IP address(es) are
released in the network. When disconnecting the PDN Connection, the TNAN needs
to locally remove the UE context and de-authenticate and disconnect the UE at
Layer 2 according to IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 [5]. When UE connects to the
network next time, the L2 disconnection serves as an indication to the UE that
the previous IPv4 address/IPv6 prefix might no longer be valid. The UE can
then proceed with re-validation or re-acquisition of its IPv4 address / IPv6
prefix.
\- The UE can send an explicit DHCPv4 message to release the IPv4 address,
then the PDN connection is disconnected when the PDN type is IPv4.
\- PDN GW Initiated Bearer Modification and HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS
Modification procedures may be used to modify the default and dedicated bearer
but correspond to no signalling over Trusted WLAN\'s airlink.
\- The dedicated bearer activation procedure may be used to activate the
dedicate bearer in S2a but correspond to no signalling over Trusted WLAN\'s
airlink.
In addition, the following procedures in clause 6 are not supported:
\- UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN connection.
\- The handover between Trusted WLAN and 3GPP Access with IP address
preservation.
#### 7.1.1.4 SaMOG deployment
WLAN networks may be deployed such that separate SSIDs are used for EPC-routed
and non-seamless WLAN offload, e.g. SSID_EPC and SSID_NSO.
WLAN networks may also be deployed such that the same SSID in a WLAN Access
Point provides different type of network access to different users attached to
this Access Point. For example, SSIDx may provide EPC-routed access for
subscriber A, but non-seamless WLAN offload for subscriber B. In such a
deployment it would be up to the operator to provide network configuration
that supports different user access preferences, subscriptions and UE
configurations.
It is recommended that the UE can be configured to apply different behavior
when connected to different SSIDs, e.g. allow or prevent the usage of certain
applications on specific SSIDs. For example, for the SSIDs used for SaMOG the
UE can be configured to disable applications that require local connectivity
(e.g. DLNA applications) and enable applications that require EPC connectivity
to the default APN used for SaMOG. Such kind of special behavior for SSIDs
used for SaMOG can improve the user experience and prolong the UE battery
life.
NOTE: An unmodified UE can be configured to apply different behaviour when
connected to different SSIDs by means which are outside the scope of this
document. For example, the UE can be configured over-the-air, by means of a
downloadable application, or by means of manual configuration.
#### 7.1.1.5 PMIP based S2a considerations
The solution described above can also work when PMIP is used over S2a with the
following considerations:
\- To support PMIP, the TNSP shall implement the MAG function as it is
specified in TS 23.402 [3], clause 6 for S2a. Instead of GTP messages the
relevant PMIP messages are used as it is specified in TS 23.402 [3], clause 6
for S2a.
\- The considerations described on APN and PDN type selection in clause
7.1.1.2 are also valid when PMIP based S2a is used.
\- The link model, IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix allocation considerations of
the sections describing the solution with GTP S2a (e.g. TNSP is the first hop
router and DHCPv4 server shall be located in the TNSP) are also valid when
PMIP based S2a is used.
### 7.1.2 Solution 2
#### 7.1.2.0 General
This solution is based on the S2a bearer creation and deletion between a
Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access and the 3GPP Home Network be driven by the AAA
signalling between these two. A key difference to the solution described in
clause 7.1.1 is that this solution uses EAP and AAA signalling to trigger
establishment of the S2a session, while the solution in clause 7.1.1 uses L3
messages to trigger the S2a session. The interfaces towards EPC (STa and S2a)
do not differ between the solutions.
NOTE: Although the solution is described for a GTP-based S2a, it would equally
apply to a PMIP-based system were the GTP signalling be replaced by the
corresponding PMIP signalling (i.e. Create Session Request replaced by Proxy
Binding Update, and Create Session Reply replaced by Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement, as well as the corresponding BBERF procedures between Trusted
WLAN Access Gateway and PCRF).
#### 7.1.2.1 Reference Model
NOTE: The shaded area in Figures 7.1.2.1-1, 7.1.2.1-2, and 7.1.2.1-3 refers to
Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access functionality.

#### 7.1.2.2 Network elements
##### 7.1.2.2.1 UE
For the purpose of accessing a Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access the UE is assumed
to be unmodified and has the following standard functions:
\- WLAN Access Network authentication based on EAP methods.

\- For IP version 6: Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) as per IETF
RFC 4861 [11], and optionally stateless DHCPv6 as per IETF RFC 3736 [19].
Optionally, Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6 (DNAv6) according to IETF RFC
6059 [14].

The Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy (TWAP) function includes:
\- Relaying the AAA information between the WLAN Access Network and the 3GPP
AAA Server or Proxy in case of roaming.
\- Establishing Binding of UE IMSI with UE MAC address on the WLAN Access
Network into (IMSI, MAC) tuple via snooping on the AAA protocol carrying EAP-
AKA exchange.
\- Detecting L2 Attach of UE to the WLAN Access Network via snooping on the

The Trusted WLAN Access Gateway function includes:
\- For IP version 4:
\- Default IPv4 Router.
\- DHCP server according to IETF RFC 2131 [9]. The TWAG allocates to the UE
the IPv4 address that is allocated to the UE by the PDN GW.
\- For IP version 6:
\- Default IPv6 Router according to IETF RFC 4861 [11].
\- Enforces routing of packets between the UE MAC address and the GTP tunnel
for that UE.
\- Enforce per-UE L2 encapsulation of traffic to/from the UE. The specifics of

802.11Q VLAN, MPLS, CAPWAP) and how it is negotiated between the Trusted WLAN
Access Network and the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway via the Trusted WLAN AAA
Proxy are dependent on the specifics of the WLAN Access Network Deployment and
out-of-scope for 3GPP.
NOTE 1: There is a per-UE subnet point-to-point link and subnet between the UE
and the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway that acts as the default router. This link
model is the same as the one used for PMIP-based S5/S8 and differs from that
of GTP-based S5/S8.
NOTE 2: Whether multiple TNAN functions are mapped to a single non-3GPP access
entity, or a single TNAN function is distributed among multiple non-3GPP
access entities is out-of-scope of 3GPP.
#### 7.1.2.3 Reference Points
##### 7.1.2.3.1 Ta reference point
The Ta reference point applies to Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access.
The Ta reference point connects the WLAN Access Network to the Trusted WLAN

negotiated between the Trusted WLAN Access Network and the Trusted WLAN Access
Gateway via the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy are dependent on the specifics of the
WLAN Access Network Deployment and out-of-scope for 3GPP.
##### 7.1.2.3.4 Tw reference point
The Tw reference point applies to Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access.
The Tw reference point connects the UE to the WLAN Access Network per IEEE
802.11 [5] specifications. The definition of IEEE Physical and Medium Access
Control layers protocols (e.g. Layer 1 and Layer 2 defined by IEEE 802.11 [5]
standards) is out of the scope of 3GPP.

and a BSSID/ESSID in the WLAN Access Network, as per IEEE 802.11
specifications.
\- The WLAN Access Network internally provides per-UE encapsulation between
the BSSID/ESSID and the Tn endpoint. The specifics of the encapsulation method
in use (e.g. L2 unicasting, IETF RFC 6085 [16], 802.11Q VLAN, MPLS, CAPWAP)
and how it is negotiated between the Trusted WLAN Access Network and the
Trusted WLAN Access Gateway via the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy are dependent on
the specifics of the WLAN Access Network Deployment and out-of-scope for 3GPP.

scope for 3GPP.
#### 7.1.2.4 Procedures
For the steps that already exist in the generic Trusted Non-3GPP Access
procedure and are re-used in the Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access procedure,
identical numbering is used, and the differences are outlined, if any. For the
steps that are specific to the Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access procedure and do
not exist in the generic Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access procedure, the steps are
indexed with the number of the generic preceding step and a letter, and a
description of the step is provided.
##### 7.1.2.4.1 Initial Attach to Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access procedure
Figure 7.1.2.4.1-1: Initial attach to Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access
The procedure for Initial Attach to Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access is
represented in Figure 7.1.2.4.1-1 and described below. It is based on the
generic Initial Attach to Trusted Non-3GPP Access procedure described in
clause 6.1.3.1. with the following differences:
\- At step 2, the following additions apply:
\- The HSS/AAA provides to the Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access the APN to which
the UE will be attached. in the subscription data. PDN type is indicated from
HSS in this step.
\- The mutual authentication between the UE and the EPC as defined in TS
23.402 [3], clause 4.9.1 is carried according to IEEE 802.11 [5]
specifications through the Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access.
\- At reception of the EAP Success, the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy buffers it and
notifies the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway of the layer 2 attach of the UE and
provides MAC address and IMSI of the UE as depicted in step 2b.
\- At step 5, after the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy informs of layer 2 attach of
the UE, the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway selects the APN as per the
subscription data received in step 2 and send Create Session Request to the
PDN GW with the PDN type.
\- At step 8, After allocating an IPv6 prefix and/or an IPv4 address to the
UE, the PDN GW sends Create Session Response to the Trusted WLAN Access
Gateway. Deferred IPv4 address allocation may be used.
\- At step 9b, the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway notifies the Trusted Non-3GPP
Access AAA Proxy of successful GTP tunnel establishment, and provides the
necessary parameters for establishment of a point-to-point link towards the UE
through the WLAN Access Network.
\- At step 9c, the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy delivers the buffered EAP success to
the WLAN Access Network together with the necessary parameters for
establishment of a point-to-point link between the UE and the Trusted WLAN
Access Gateway. On receiving this, the WLAN Access Network configures the
point-to-point link adequately and informs the UE of EAP success.
\- At step 11, after the UE is associated and authenticated with the WLAN
Access Network, the UE performs IP layer configuration with the Trusted WLAN
Access Gateway acting as the default router according to standard IETF
procedures [9] [12] [13] [14] [19].
NOTE: The WLAN Access Gateway can send unsolicited IP layer configuration
signalling, e.g. DHCPv4 or RA, over the point-to-point link towards the UE.
##### 7.1.2.4.2 UE/Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access Network Initiated Detach
procedure

The procedure for UE/Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access Network Initiated Detach is
represented in Figure 7.1.2.4.2-1 and described below. It is based on the
generic UE/Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access Network Initiated Detach procedure
described in clause 6.1.3.2.1. with the following differences:
\- At step 2, the following additions apply:
\- In step 2b, the UE/Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access Network Initiated Detach
triggers AAA signalling between the WLAN Access Network and the home HSS/AAA
server to terminate the session.
\- Based on the AAA signalling for session termination, the Trusted WLAN AAA
Proxy sends a WLAN Detach Request to the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway.
\- Step 3 is initiated by the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway based on the WLAN
Detach Request received from the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy.
\- At step 6, the following addition applies:
\- In step 6b, the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway confirms session deletion by
sending to the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy a WLAN detach accept.
##### 7.1.2.4.3 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach procedure
Figure 7.1.2.4.3-1: HSS/AAA Initiated Detach
The procedure for HSS/AAA Initiated Detach from Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access
Network is represented in Figure 7.1.2.4.3-1 and described below. As for the
UE/Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access Network Initiated Detach, it is based on the
generic HSS/AAA Initiated Detach procedure described in clause 6.1.3.2.2 with
the following differences:
\- At step 2, the step 2c to 6b of the UE/Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access Network
Initiated Detach procedure described in clause 7.1.2.4.2 are followed.
##### 7.1.2.4.4 Other procedures
Other procedures defined for the generic Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access refer to
clause 7.1.1.3 descriptions.
### 7.1.3 Handovers with or without TNSP/TWAG relocation with unmodified UEs
No specific mechanisms are defined to support AP-to-AP handover with and
without TNSP/TWAG relocation. However, this does not preclude the support of
IP address preservation in handovers without TNSP/TWAG relocation when
supported by procedures out of 3GPP scope.
# 8 Additional considerations for WLAN access to EPC through S2a for Phase 2
> Editor\'s Note: Phase 2 of the study is aiming at studying enhancements to
> the Rel-11 solution to avoid those limitations (except emergency attach). In
> this phase it is expected that there will be some impacts to the UE.
## 8.1 Requirements
> Editor's Note: This sub-clause will contain the requirement(s) related to
> SaMOG Phase 2 study.
The solutions shall comply with the following Requirements:
  * The SaMOG phase 2 solution (e.g. possibly with impact to the UE) shall be able to co-exist with the SaMOG Release 11 solution.
The solutions shall comply with one or more of the following requirements:
  * For a UE, multiple simultaneous PDN connections over Trusted WLAN are supported, including the support for establishment of concurrent PDN Connections via 3GPP access and over WLAN.
  * For a UE, PDN Connectivity to EPC over Trusted WLAN concurrent with non-seamless WLAN offload is supported.
  * The UE is capable of IP address preservation in case of mobility between a 3GPP access and a Trusted WLAN. The UE is capable to request IP address preservation per PDN connection in case of mobility between a 3GPP access and a Trusted WLAN.
  * The UE is capable of signalling the requested APN over Trusted WLAN, and the UE is capable of receiving the selected APN over Trusted WLAN (e.g. in case the UE did not indicate an APN).
  * The UE is capable of indicating whether it requests a PDN connection or a NSWO connectivity service over Trusted WLAN, and the UE is capable of receiving an indication of whether the granted service is a PDN connection or NSWO connectivity (e.g. in case the UE did not indicate the kind of service it was requesting). A solution may also enable NSWO connectivity establishment only as the first connection. It is not required to release the NSWO connection without releasing the other connections.
  * The solution should minimize the UE functional changes.
## 8.1A Key issues
  * Regarding the feature of handover with IP address preservation. S2a already supports the hand-over indication that can be used by the TWAG to tell the PGW that the IP address is to be preserved. A solution is needed to enable the UE to provide to the TWAN an indication of whether the access to the TWAN corresponds to a "handover" (with IP address preservation) or "initial attach".
  * Regarding the feature of connecting to a non-default APN. Also here, S2a already supports this. The TWAN will also get all relevant APN profile information for this UE from the 3GPP AAA/HSS as part of the STa authentication and authorization process. A solution is needed to enable the UE to explicitly indicate which APN to connect to, and for the UE to be informed about the APN that the TWAN connected the UE to.
  * Regarding the feature of the UE choosing between access to EPC and NSWO. Also here, the TWAN will also get all relevant APN profile information for this UE from the 3GPP AAA/HSS as part of the STa authentication and authorization process. A solution is needed for enabling the UE to indicate to the network whether an IP session is requested for EPC access or for non-seamless WLAN offload, and the network to respond whether the access request has been granted.
  * Regarding the feature of the UE requesting a connection to an additional PDN. Also here, a solution is needed for the UE to request an additional PDN connection. Besides this, additional logic may be needed to correlate an individual user plane IP packet to an individual PDN connection. The solution shall take into account all situations and in particular when:
    1. Two or more PDN connections from one UE might have the same IP address. This is in particular possible if these PDN connections are towards different PDN(s) using IPv4 private addressing.
    2. Downlink (link layer) broadcasts do not include a specific UE target IP address (associated with a PDN connection).
    3. Downlink IP multicast does not include a specific UE target IP address, and the sources of multicast services would have also the same IPv4 private address.
> The UE, the TWAG and/or the link between them, may need to implement means
> to cope with these situations.
  * Regarding the support for the same UE of simultaneous access to EPC through S2a and of non-seamless offload, similar considerations than for the support of simultaneous PDN connections apply.
## 8.2 Solutions
> Editor's Note: This clause will describe the solution(s) for SaMOG Phase 2
> study.
### 8.2.1 Solution 1: Tunnelled approach with dedicated UE-TWAG control
protocol
#### 8.2.1.1 Functional Description
> Editor\'s Note: It should be described whether and how the solution fulfils
> the requirements in subclause 8.1.
##### 8.2.1.1.1 Overview
This solution uses a two-scenario approach to support handover, non-default
APN and multiple PDN connections:
  1. Single-connection scenario: In this scenario, the network or the UE only supports a single IP connection over WLAN. An IP connection is either a PDN connection or a NSWO connection. EAP signaling between UE and network is enhanced to carry attach parameters (e.g. handover indicator or APN or a request for NSWO).
  2. Multi-connection scenario: In this scenario, the network and the UE both support multiple connections over WLAN. In the multi-connection scenario, a signaling protocol to manage PDN connections is needed. Also, a user-plane separation mechanism is needed to separate user-plane traffic between the different active PDN connections. A NSWO IP address or prefix is obtained through standard IETF procedures (i.e. DHCP or IPv6 Stateless Address Auto-configuration).
Negotiation of which scenario to choose is done once as part of the attachment
EAP signaling between UE and network.
##### 8.2.1.1.2 User plane
In the single-connection scenario, the PDN connection over WLAN uses the per-
UE point-to-point link as defined in TS 23.402 clause 16. Such point-to-point
link carries MAC frames. The MAC frame would typically carry an IP packet. IP
is indicated by means of the "EtherType" field in the MAC header as defined in
IEEE 802.1 (e.g. IPv4 is indicated by the Ethertype 0x0800).
Figure 8.2.1.1.2-1 Frame format for the single-connection scenario
For the multi-connection scenario, there is at most one NSWO connection. For
all PDN connections over WLAN, an additional layer between MAC and IP is used
when carrying IP packets belonging to these connections. The MAC "Ethertype"
field would in this case instead indicate "XYZ", where "XYZ" is an identifier
for the protocol that is used to include: 1) A key to differentiate the PDN
connections from each other; 2) A next header indicator, which will be
typically IP. The key is unique within the scope of a single UE. The key
combined with the MAC address of the UE provides a globally unique
identification for a PDN connection. The TWAG and the UE can use this
identification to correlate a packet to the correct PDN connection. In the
following two subsections, two alternatives are proposed for "XYZ".
> Editor\'s Notes: One of these two alternatives needs to be chosen. Which one
> is still FFS.
Figure 8.2.1.1.2-2 Frame format for PDN connections in the multi-connection
scenario
###### 8.2.1.1.2.1 Alternative 1: XYZ = GRE
In this alternative, XYZ is the GRE header as defined in IETF RFC 2890. The
GRE key is used to differentiate the PDN connections from each other. This
requires that GRE is defined by IEEE as new EtherType.
As the access point is functioning like a layer-2 bridge, it forwards frames
between its WiFi interface and its wired interface without checking the
EtherType value. If the access point implements a mapping between IEEE 802.11e
priorities and DSCP, then the DSCP will be found on a different offset for
frames with EtherType GRE compared to frames with EtherType IPv4 or IPv6.
###### 8.2.1.1.1.2.2 Alternative 2: XYZ = VLAN
In this alternative, XYZ is an extension of the MAC header, forming a VLAN-
tagged MAC header. The VLAN ID is used as key to differentiate the PDN
connections from each other.
The AP performs translation between the IEEE Std 802.11 air link and the IEEE
802 AP-TWAG segment e.g. using IEEE 802.11 integration service per IEEE
802.11-2007 appendix M. The solution relies on the VLAN ID to be carried un-
modified to the TWAG.
The VLAN ID used to distinguish PDN connections is encapsulated over the air
in LLC SNAP and thus cannot be used for any other (non-3GPP) service
differentiation over the air.
As described in TS 23.402 clause 16, the WLAN AN enforces upstream and
downstream forced-forwarding between the UE\'s WLAN IEEE 802.11 association
and the TWAG. The way this forced-forwarding is enforced ensures that the VLAN
ID used to multiplex TWAN connectivity services is in a different protocol
stack layer than VLAN ID potentially used on the transport interface between
the UE and the TWAG.
The VLAN ID used to multiplex TWAN connectivity services is not used to route
traffic on the path between the AP and the TWAG.
If the access point implements a mapping between IEEE 802.11e priorities and
DSCP, then the DSCP will be found on a different offset for VLAN-tagged frames
compared to frames without VLAN tagging.
##### 8.2.1.1.3 Control plane
A UE-TWAG protocol is needed to control (i.e. setup and teardown) the per-PDN
point-to-point link. This protocol is denoted as TSM (TWAN Session
Management). TSM is a new protocol defined by 3GPP. The functions that WLCP
supports include: Establishment of a per-UE-and-PDN point-to-point link; Tear
down of a per-UE-and-PDN point-to-point link.
As described in clause 8.2.1.1.1, a User Plane Connection ID (GRE key or VLAN
ID) value is needed to differentiate PDN connections. When establishing a new
per-UE-and-PDN point-to-point link using TSM, the network decides upon this
User Plane Connection ID value and returns it to the UE.
In the following two subsections, two alternatives to support the control
protocol are proposed.
> Editor\'s Notes: One of these two alternatives needs to be chosen. Which one
> is still FFS.
###### 8.2.1.1.3.1 Alternative 1: L2.5-based control protocol
In this alternative, the following frame format is used for control plane
messages.
Figure 8.2.1.1.3.1-1 Frame format for PDN for L2.5-based control protocol
Just as for the user plane frames, the EtherType in MAC is set to "XYZ" (i.e.
GRE or VLAN). As described in section 8.2.1.1.2, "XYZ" contains both a next
header field (i.e. EtherType) and a key field (i.e. GRE key or VLAN ID). The
EtherType field in "XYZ" is set to a new value for control plane signalling.
It is required that IEEE defines such new value. The key field is set to a
dedicated value. The payload contains the control protocol message.
Alternatively, the EtherType in MAC is not set to "XYZ" but to a new value for
control plane signalling. The "XYZ" part of the frame can then be omitted for
control signalling. In that case, the frame for the control protocol would be
as follows.
Figure 8.2.1.1.3.1-2 Alternative frame format for PDN for L2.5-based control
protocol
> Editor\'s Notes: One of these two alternatives needs to be chosen. Which one
> is still FFS.
If the UE is unaware of the TWAG MAC address, the first TSM message is sent in
MAC broadcast to the TWAG. From the TWAG reply, the UE learns the TWAG MAC
address. Alternatively, the TWAG MAC address is sent to the UE as part of the
EAP-AKA' signalling.
> Editor\'s Notes: One of these two alternatives needs to be chosen. Which one
> is still FFS.
###### 8.2.1.1.3.2 Alternative 2: L3-based control protocol
In this alternative, the following frame format is used for control plane
messages.
Figure 8.2.1.1.3.2-1 Frame format for PDN for L3-based control protocol
The payload contains the control protocol message. The IP address used is
either the NSWO address, or a link-local address in case NSWO is not possible.
A dedicated TCP or UDP port is used for control plane signalling.
> Editor\'s Notes: It is FFS if TCP or UDP is to be used.
If the UE is unaware of the TWAG MAC address, the first TSM message is sent in
MAC broadcast to the TWAG. If the UE is unaware of the TWAG IP address, the
first TSM message is sent in IPv4 broadcast / IPv6 multicast to the TWAG. From
the TWAG reply, the UE learns the TWAG MAC and IP address. Alternatively, the
TWAG MAC and IP address is sent to the UE as part of the EAP-AKA' signalling.
> Editor\'s Notes: One of these two alternatives needs to be chosen. Which one
> is still FFS.

> Editor\'s Notes: Impact on link model due to handover support is FFS.
#### 8.2.1.2 Procedures
##### 8.2.1.2.1 Initial Attach in WLAN on S2a
Figure 8.2.1.2.1.1-1: Initial attachment in WLAN on GTP S2a for roaming and
non-roaming scenarios
The procedure is as TS 23.402 clause 16.2.1 with the following additions:
  * Step 2. As part of this step, the UE shall send an indication to the network whether it supports single-connection or multi-connection or both. If the UE supports the single-connection scenario, the UE also indicates whether it requests EPC access or non-seamless WLAN offload. If the UE requests EPC access, it may indicate APN.
> These indicators are sent in EAP-AKA to the 3GPP AAA. The 3GPP AAA sends
> these indicators to the TWAN. Depending on the capabilities of the network
> and the request of the UE, the network informs the UE as part of step 2
> whether the single-connection scenario or the multi-connection scenario is
> selected. If both network and UE support both single-connection and multi-
> connection, then the network selects the multi-connection scenario.
>
> In case the single-connection scenario is selected, the procedure continues
> as described in clause 8.2.1.2.2. In case the multi-connection scenario is
> selected, the procedure continues as described in clause 8.2.1.2.3.

S2a (continuation)
Figure 8.2.1.2.2.1-1: Initial attachment in single-connection scenario in WLAN
on GTP S2a for roaming and non-roaming scenarios
The procedure continues from step 2 in clause 8.2.1.2.1:
  * Step 2. As part of this step, the UE is made aware of the network support of SAMOG phase 2 features and if the requested connectivity feature (attach to non-default APN, non-seamless WLAN offload, EPC-routed traffic) is accepted by the network. Also, if the UE requested EPC access without indicating APN, then the network indicates the selected (default) APN. If the UE requested EPC access and indicated an APN, then the network verifies that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE requested NSWO and it was accepted by the network, steps 3-7 and 10-14 are skipped. If the requested connectivity feature is not possible, the request is rejected with a relevant authorization failure.
```{=html}
``` \- Step 3 and step 10. The TWAN selects the PDN GW for the APN, and
includes the APN in the Create Session Request. The APN is determined by the
TWAN based on the UE request and on the subscription data received from the
AAA server.
NOTE: In the single-connection scenario, if a UE using NSWO wants to establish
a PDN Connection, or if the UE has a PDN Connection but wants to use NSWO, the
UE needs to detach from TWAN and make a new Initial Attach.

(continuation)
Figure 8.2.1.2.3-1: Initial attachment in multi-connection scenario in WLAN on
GTP S2a for roaming, and non-roaming scenarios
The procedure continues from step 2 in clause 8.2.1.2.1:
  * Step 2. As part of this step, the UE is made aware of the network support of SAMOG phase 2 features. Non-seamless WLAN offload is possible if the network supports this and the UE is entitled to use this. As part of step 2, the UE is made aware whether or not non-seamless WLAN offload is possible. If non-seamless WLAN offload is possible, then the UE receives the address or prefix of the non-seamless WLAN offload connection as part of steps 9 and 15. If non-seamless WLAN offload is not possible, and the control protocol is L2.5-based, then step 9 and 15 are not performed. If non-seamless WLAN offload is not possible, and the control protocol is L3-based, then step 9 is not performed and in step 15 only a link-local IP address is configured.
  * Step 16. The procedure "UE-Initiated Connectivity to PDN in WLAN on S2a" in clause 8.2.1.2.4 may be performed to establish a PDN connection.
After the attach procedure, the UE has at least one IP connection (either a
NSWO connection or a PDN connection).
##### 8.2.1.2.4 UE-Initiated Connectivity to PDN in WLAN on S2a
###### 8.2.1.2.4.1 UE-Initiated Connectivity to PDN in WLAN on GTP S2a
This procedure can only be performed if the multi-connection scenario was
selected during authentication.
This procedure is used when the UE has previously attached to WLAN and the UE
wishes to establish one or more PDN connections over WLAN. This procedure is
also used when the UE already has one or more PDN connections over WLAN and
wishes to establish one or more additional PDN connections over WLAN. This
procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN
connection over WLAN when the UE is simultaneously connected to WLAN and a
3GPP access, and the UE already has active PDN connections over both the
accesses. The UE establishes a separate point-to-point link to the TWAG for
each PDN connection.
There can be more than one PDN connection per APN when GTP is used between the
TWAN and the PDN GW. During the establishment of a new PDN connection, the
TWAN allocates and sends a default S2a bearer ID to the PDN GW. The default
S2a bearer ID is unique in the scope of the UE within a TWAG, i.e. the IMSI
and the default S2a bearer ID together identify a PDN connection within a
TWAG. In o**r** der to be able to identify a specific established PDN
connection, both the TWAG and the PDN GW shall store the default S2a bearer
ID.
NOTE: The establishment of a connection to a PDN connection does not impact
the NSWO connection if that was previously setup. As a separate point-to-point
link is used for each PDN connection, traffic separation can be achieved
between all connections including the NWSO connection.
Figure 8.2.1.4.2.1-1: UE-Initiated Connectivity to PDN in WLAN on GTP S2a
  * Step 1. The UE triggers the establishment of a new per-UE-and-PDN point-to-point link by means of TSM. This step establishes the setup of a new per-UE-and-PDN-connection point-to-point link to the TWAG. The UE may indicate the requested APN. The UE triggers the re-establishment of an existing PDN connectivity by providing a handover indicator. In that case, it shall provide an APN.
  * Step 2-6. Same as step 3-7 in clause 8.2.1.2.2.1. As part of these steps, the TWAN verifies that the APN requested by the UE is allowed by subscription. Upon handover, the TWAN selects the PDN GW handling this PDN connection; otherwise, the TWAN performs PDN GW selection as described in TS 23.402. Steps 2-6 are executed with the selected PDN GW.
  * Step 7. By means of TSM, the TWAN returns a response to the establishment of a new per-UE-and-PDN point-to-point link. This response contains a User Plane Connection ID. If the UE did not indicate the APN in the request, then the response indicates the selected default APN. If the UE does not receive an IPv4 address in this step, it may negotiate the IPv4 address with DHCPv4 in step 8,
  * Step 8. As step 9 in clause 8.2.1.2.2.1.
  * Step 9. As step 15 in clause 8.2.1.2.2.1.

access to WLAN on S2a
###### 8.2.1.2.5.1 Handover in single-connection scenario from 3GPP access to
WLAN on GTP S2a
This procedure is used in the single-connection scenario to hand over a single
PDN Connection from 3GPP access to WLAN. The decision to use the single-
connection scenariois made during authentication as described in clause
8.2.1.2.1.
Figure 8.2.1.2.5.1-1: Handover in single-connection scenario from 3GPP access
to Trusted WLAN on GTP S2a for roaming and non-roaming scenarios
The home routed roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios are depicted in the
figure 8.2.1.2.5.1-1:
\- In the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding
messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and
vice versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the
HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
\- In the home routed roaming and non-roaming cases, the vPCRF and the 3GPP
AAA Proxy are not involved, except for the authentication and authorization in
step 2.
The steps in figure 8.2.1.2.5.1-1 are based on figure 8.2.1.2.2.1-1, with the
following changes:
  * Step 0. The UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on the S5/S8 interface.
  * Step 2. As step 2 in 8.2.1.2.1.1with the following addition: If the UE supports single-connection, then the UE indicates handover via EAP-AKA to 3GPP AAA.
  * Step 3 and 10. As step 3 and 10 in 8.2.1.2.2.1 with the following addition: The handover indication is set in the Create Session Request to allow the PDN GW to re-allocate the same IP address or prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to the 3GPP access and to initiate a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF.
  * Step 4 and 11. The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IPâ€‘CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [4]. The Event Report indicates the change in Access Type.
> If the PDN GW decides to allocate a new IP address/prefix instead of
> preserving the old IP address/prefix, as described in TS 23.402 clause
> 4.1.3.2.3, the PDN GW executes an IP-CAN session Establishment Procedure
> with the PCRF instead of a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
> Procedure.
  * Step 6 and 13. The PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR, Charging ID, Cause). The Create Session Response contains the IP address and/or the prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to the 3GPP IP access. The Charging Id provided by the PGW is the Charging Id previously assigned to the default bearer of the PDN connection in the 3GPP access.

``` \- Step 16. The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN
Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in TS 23.402 clause 5.6.2.2

access to WLAN on S2a
###### 8.2.1.2.6.1 Handover in multi-connection scenario from 3GPP access to
WLAN on GTP S2a
This procedure is used in the multi-connection scenario to hand over a one or
more PDN Connection from 3GPP access to WLAN. The decision to use the multi-
connection scenario is made during authentication as described in clause
8.2.1.2.1.
Figure 8.2.1.2.6.1-1: Handover from 3GPP access to Trusted WLAN on GTP S2a for
roaming and non-roaming scenarios
The home routed roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios are depicted in the
figure 8.2.1.2.6.1-1:
\- In the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding
messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and
vice versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the
HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
\- In the home routed roaming and non-roaming cases, the vPCRF and the 3GPP
AAA Proxy are not involved, except for the authentication and authorization in
step 2.
If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 1 to 15
shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 16 for each PDN connection
that is being transferred from 3GPP access.
If the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 15 shall be performed.
As described in clause 8.2.1.2.3, these steps result in the UE receiving the
address or prefix of the non-seamless WLAN offload connection, if supported by
the network for this UE. The UE shall then perform step 16 for each PDN
connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.
Step 17 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred
from 3GPP access. Step 16 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other aspects
related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in TS 23.402 clause
8.1.
The steps in figure 8.2.1.2.6.1-1 are based on figure 8.2.1.2.3-1, with the
following changes:
  * Step 0. The UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on the S5/S8 interface.
  * Step 2. As step 2 in 8.2.1.2.1 with the following addition: The UE indicates handover via EAP to 3GPP AAA.
  * Step 16. For connectivity to multiple PDN connections, the UE establishes connectivity to each PDN that is being transferred from 3GPP access, by executing the UE-initiated Connectivity to PDN procedure specified in clause 8.2.1.2.4.
  * Step 17. The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in TS 23.402 clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [6], clause 5.4.4.1.

For UE/TWAN initiated detach, this procedure is the same as TS 23.402 clause
16.3.1.1.
If the single-connection scenario was selected during authentication, then the
UE/TWAN requested PDN disconnection procedure is the same as TS 23.402 clause
16.3.1.1.
If the multi-connection scenario was selected during authentication, then this
clause applies to UE/TWAN-requested PDN disconnection procedure. For multiple
PDN connections, this disconnection procedure shall be repeated for each PDN
connection that needs to be released.
Figure 8.2.1.2.8.1.1-1: UE/TWAN-initiated PDN disconnection procedure with GTP
S2a in WLAN
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local
Breakout cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages
between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming and Home Routed Roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps of
interaction between the PDN GW and PCRF do not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may
employ static configured policies.
  * Step 1. If the PDN disconnection is initiated by the UE, the UE sends a PDN Disconnection Request (User Plane Connection ID) to the TWAG by means of TSM.
```{=html}
``` \- Step 2. The TWAN releases the PDN connection and sends a Delete Session
Request (Linked EPS Bearer ID) message for this PDN connection to the PDN GW.
  * Step 3. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection.
  * Step 4. The PDN GW deletes the IP CAN session associated with the UE and executes a PCEF-Initiated IPâ€‘CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [4].
  * Step 5. The PDN GW acknowledges with a Delete Session Response (Cause) message.
  * Step 6. If the PDN disconnection was initiated by the UE in step 1, then the UE is informed of the disconnection by means of a TSM PDN Disconnection Response.
  * Step 7. If the PDN disconnection was initiated by the TWAG, then the UE is informed of the disconnection by means of a TSM PDN Disconnection Request (User Plane Connection ID).
  * Step 8. The UE acknowledges the disconnection request received in step 7.

### 8.2.2 Solution 2: Layer 2 solution based on Stateful Address Configuration
of Per-PDN Connection/NSWO Point-to-Point Link Multiplexed at Layer 2
#### 8.2.2.1 Functional Description
##### 8.2.2.1.1 User Plane Multiplexing for Per-PDN Connection / NSWO Point-
to-Point Link
###### 8.2.2.1.1.0 General
The solution relies on the use of Stateful Address Configuration of Per-PDN
Connection / NSWO Point-to-Point Link Multiplexed at Layer 2.
In addition to the two mechanisms described as part of this solution in
subclause 8.2.2.1.1.1 (Per PDN/NSWO VLAN Id), and subclause 8.2.2.1.1.2 (Per
PDN/NSWO TWAG MAC Address), any type of per-PDN/NSWO packet marking mechanism
layered directly over L2 but below IPv4/IPv6 could be used with this solution,
including, but not limited to, keyed GRE over Ethernet as described as part of
Solution 1 in subclause 8.2.1, or a new 3GPP specific LLC/SNAP header as
described as part of Solution 8 in subclause 8.2.8.
Multiple PDN Connections to the same APN are supported via allocation of
multiple identifiers (e.g. VLAN Ids) for multiple point-to-point links.
###### 8.2.2.1.1.1 Per-PDN Connection/NSWO Virtual Point-to-Point Link Model
based on distinct VLAN ID
Figure 8.2.2.1.1.1-1: Point-to-point link model for PDN connection and NSWO
access based on distinct VLAN ID
In this link model the virtual point-to-point link required to transport
traffic for a given PDN connection, of for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) is
realized via the TWAG reserving a distinct VLAN ID that uniquely (on a per-UE
basis) corresponds to an APN or NSWO. These distinct VLAN ID are configured on
the TWAG interface, i.e., the TWAG can receive and send layer 2 frames from
and to each of these VLAN ID.
As depicted in Figure 8.2.2.1.1.1-1, the virtual point-to-point link is
realized via enforcing forwarding of uplink and downlink IP packets between
distinct PDN connections and NSWO access into their corresponding VLANs via
marking layer 2 frame contacting these IP packets with the appropriate VLAN
ID. VLAN marking over the IEEE Std 802.11 air link is performed as per Annex P
of IEEE Std 802.11 [5].
On the UE, each of the virtual point-to-point link is modelled as a virtual
interface that is exposed to the IP layer with a fixed IPv4 and/or IPv6
address(es). Applications can bind sockets to a specific virtual interface
thus in effect binding the socket to a specific PDN connection or to NSWO
access. Packet transmission occurs as follow:
  * In the uplink direction, all IP packets transmitted via the virtual interface, including IP multicast packets, are encapsulated in layer 2 frames marked with the VLAN ID that corresponds to the PDN connection or NSWO access the socket/interface is bound to. On the receiving side, the TWAG is able to demultiplex incoming packets towards the appropriate PDN connection or NSWO access via looking up the VLAN ID of the layer 2 data frame.
  * In the downlink direction, the TWAG transmits all IP packets, including IP multicast packets, encapsulated in layer 2 frames marked with the VLAN ID that corresponds to the PDN connection or NSWO access the packet originated from. On the receiving side, the UE is able to demultiplex incoming packets towards the appropriate PDN connection or NSWO access via looking up the VLAN ID of the layer 2 data frame, and passes the IP packets contained in these frames to the IP layer via the corresponding virtual interface.

###### 8.2.2.1.1.2 Per-PDN Connection/NSWO Virtual Point-to-Point Link Model
based on distinct layer 2 TWAG MAC addresses
Figure 8.2.2.1.1.2-1: Point-to-point link model for PDN connection and NSWO
access based on distinct layer 2 TWAG MAC addresses
In this link model the virtual point-to-point link required to transport
traffic for a given PDN connection, of for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) is
realized via the TWAG reserving a distinct MAC address that uniquely (on a
per-UE basis) corresponds to an APN or NSWO. These distinct layer 2 MAC
addresses are configured on the TWAG interface, i.e., the TWAG can receive and
send layer 2 frames from each of these MAC addresses.
As depicted in Figure 8.2.2.1.1.2-1, the virtual point-to-point link is
realized via enforcing a forced forwarding of uplink and downlink IP packets
respectively to and from the corresponding layer 2 TWAG MAC address located in
the layer 2 header of the frame containing the IP packets.
On the UE, each of the virtual point-to-point link is modelled as a virtual
interface that is exposed to the IP layer with a fixed IPv4 and/or IPv6
address(es). Applications can bind sockets to a specific virtual interface
thus in effect binding the socket to a specific PDN connection or to NSWO
access. Packet transmission occurs as follow:
  * In the uplink direction, all IP packets transmitted via the virtual interface, including IP multicast packets, are encapsulated in layer 2 frames with destination layer 2 address set to the layer 2 unicast MAC address of the TWAG that corresponds to the PDN connection or NSWO access the socket/interface is bound to. On the receiving side, after identifying the associated UE using the source MAC address of the data frame, the TWAG is able to demultiplex incoming packets towards the appropriate PDN connection or NSWO access via looking up the layer 2 destination address TWAG-MAC of the data frame.
  * In the downlink direction, the TWAG transmits all IP packets, including IP multicast packets, encapsulated in layer 2 frames with source layer 2 address set to the layer 2 unicast MAC address of the TWAG that corresponds to the PDN connection or NSWO access the packet originated from. On the receiving side, the UE is able to demultiplex incoming packets towards the appropriate PDN connection or NSWO access via looking up the layer 2 source unicast MAC address of the data frame, and passes the IP packets contained in these frames to the IP layer via the corresponding virtual interface.
##### 8.2.2.1.2 Initial Attach in WLAN
Figure 8.2.2.1.2-1: Initial Attach in WLAN on GTP or PMIP S2a for roaming, LBO
and non-roaming scenarios
As depicted in Figure 8.2.2.1.2-1, the initial attach procedure occurs with
the following steps:
The first step of the proposal is for both the UE, the Trusted WLAN Access,
and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to discover whether all of them do
support fully fledged Trusted WLAN Access to the EPC (i.e., as per the
requirements, concurrent multiple PDN connections, IP address preservation,
and concurrent NSWO and EPC access). This is done in the following way:
  1. The UE discovers the TWAN and associates with it.
  2. The TWAN begins the EAP exchange by sending an EAP Request message as part of the IEEE 802.1X authentication procedure [5]. As part of the EAP exchange, the UE, the Trusted WLAN Access, and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to discover whether all of them do support fully fledged Trusted WLAN Access to the EPC (i.e., as per the requirements, concurrent multiple PDN connections, IP address preservation, and concurrent NSWO and EPC access):
a. The UE indicates support to the 3GPP AAA server in the HPLMN via including
an indication EAP-AKA attribute in the EAP-AKA Response messages it sends.
b. The Trusted WLAN Access indicates support to the 3GPP AAA server in the
HPLMN via including an indication AAA attribute in the Diameter EAP-Request
message it sends.
c. The 3GPP AAA server in the HPLMN indicates to the Trusted WLAN Access that
both itself and the UE have support via inclusion of the same indication AAA
attribute in the Diameter EAP-Answer message it sends.
d. The 3GPP AAA server in the HPLMN indicates to UE that both itself and the
Trusted WLAN Access have support via inclusion of a similar indication
attribute within the EAP-AKA Request message.
e. If either of the UE, the Trusted WLAN Access Network, or the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN support fully fledged Trusted WLAN Access to the EPC,
failback to single PDN connection to a default per-subscription APN ensues
(phase 1 SaMOG) as per steps 3-15 of subclause 16.2.1of 3GPP TS 23.402 [3] in
case of GTP S2a or subclause 16.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [3] in case of PMIP S2a.
If on the other hand all of the UE, the Trusted WLAN Access Network, and the
HPMLN support fully fledged Trusted WLAN Access to the EPC, neither PDN
connections nor Non-Seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) is offered automatically by
the Trusted WLAN Access without explicit request from the UE as described in
subclause 8.2.2.1.3.
##### 8.2.2.1.3 UE Requested PDN or NSWO connectivity
The UE explicitly requests establishment of PDN connections and/or NSWO in two
steps: preparation and execution.
In a first preparation step, the UE queriesfrom the network the values of the
VLAN or TWAG MAC address to use to reach a list of APNs it might want to
establish a PDN connection to in the future, including the unspecified
\'default\' APN that will be selected by the network (similar to the default
APN that exists in phase 1 of SaMOG), as well as NSWO. The UE also indicates
to the network the PDN Type of the PDN connection it will desire to establish.
The signalling to carry on with this query from the UE to the network based on
the use of EAP-AKA [22] extensions attributes during the authentication phase.
As a result of this query, the network indicates to the UE a list of VLAN
identifiers (first variant of the virtual point-to-point link model), TWAG MAC
addresses (second variant of the virtual point-to-point link model), or any
other point-to-point link multiplexing identifier (e.g., for keyed GRE or new
3GPP SNAP protocol) that corresponds to each of the APN in which it has
expressed interest in connecting to (as well as the value that was selected by
the network as the \'default\' APN) on one hand, and to NSWO on the other
hand. Again, the signalling to carry on with this indication from the network
to the UE is based on the use of EAP-AKA extension attributes that are
populated by the 3GPP AAA Server based on information received from the
Trusted WLAN Access.A list of L2 identifiers for multiplexing of the point-to-
point links is chosen locally by the TWAN based on configuration, and sent to
the AAA server over STa. The AAA server extracts from this list as many L2
identifiers as there are PDN connections requested by the UE in the EAP
Response/Identity, and includes it together with the authorized PDN types for
those APN as per the subscription in the EAP Request/AKA-Challenge or AKA-
Reauthentication message sent back to the UE, while the list of APNs for the
PDN connections requested by UE is sent to the TWAN over STa.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how a UE that requests a dual IP version PDN Type
IPv4v6 is informed that the established PDN connection has a single IP version
PDN Type (i.e., IPv4, or IPv6) in cases where the selected PDN GW only allows
single IP version PDN Type for this APN.
IF a UE expects to need multiple PDN connections to a single APN, it needs to
requests multiple point-to-point link multiplexing identifiers for that same
APN. The network may decide to respond fully to the request, or with a lesser
number of point-to-point link multiplexing identifiers.
NOTE: Because the values of the point-to-point link identifiers for the
various APNs the UE wishes to connect to are negotiated during the EAP-AKA
exchange, APNs need to be known prior to authentication with the Trusted WLAN
Access. In the unlikely event that the UE needs to connect to an unforeseen
APN, the UE would be required to disconnect, then reconnect, to the Trusted
WLAN Access.
NOTE: Because the values of the point-to-point link identifiers for the
various APNs the UE wishes to connect to are negotiated during the EAP-AKA
exchange, all this information needs to fit in a single EAP-AKA message. This
places a limit on the number of the point-to-point links and APNs that can be
negotiated. However given that on a 3GPP access a UE is also limited to a
maximum of 12 simultaneous bearers, and hence PDN connections, it is deemed
reasonable that for Trusted WLAN Access a limitation also exists.
NOTE: In case where the subscription profile list the wildcard APN, the TWAN
would need to send all APNs supported by an HPLMN (with corresponding VLAN IDs
or TWAG MAC addresses) to the UE via EAP-AKA' or ANQP.
Figure 8.2.2.1.3-1: UE requested PDN or NSWO connectivity for GTP-based S2a
Figure 8.2.2.1.3-2: UE requested PDN or NSWO connectivity for PMIP-based S2a
In a second execution step, the UE explicitly requests establishment of a PDN
connection to a specific APN or activation and deactivation of NSWO as per the
following steps depicted in Figure 8.2.2.1.3-1 for GTP-based S2a and Figure
8.2.2.1.3-2 for PMIP-based S2a:
> 1\. The UE creates a virtual IP interface corresponding to the APN towards
> which it desires to establish a PDN connection, or to NSWO.
>
> 2\. The UE requests allocation of an IPV4 and/or IPv6 address for this
> virtual interface by sending a DHCP or DHCPv6 request message from this
> virtual interface. In the first variant of the virtual point-to-point link
> model, the layer 2 frame carrying the DHCP is marked with the corresponding
> VLAN Id. In the second variant of the virtual point-to-point link model, the
> layer 2 frame carrying the DHCP message will be unicasted to the
> corresponding TWAG MAC address.
NOTE: The UE may requests allocation of an IPv4 address via DHCP but still
perform IPv6 Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) for configuration of
its IPv6 address. In this case, the UE or the network signal the will to tear
down a PDN connection and/or NSWO access based solely on DHCP signaling for
the IPv4 address.

##### 8.2.2.1.4 UE Requested PDN or NSWO disconnection
Figure 8.2.2.1.4-1: UE requested PDN or NSWO disconnection for GTP-based S2a
Figure 8.2.2.1.4-2: UE requested PDN or NSWO disconnection for PMIP-based S2a
The UE explicitly requests disconnection of a PDN disconnection to a specific
APN or deactivation of NSWO and deactivation of NSWO as per the following
steps:
  1. The UE releases the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address allocated for the virtual interface by sending a DHCP or DHCPv6 release from this virtual interface. In the first variant of the virtual point-to-point link model, the layer 2 frame carrying the DHCP message is marked with the corresponding VLAN Id. In the second variant of the virtual point-to-point link model, the layer 2 frame carrying the DHCP message will be unicasted to the corresponding TWAG MAC address.
  2. When the TWAG receives the DHCP IPv4 and/or IPv6 address release message over the virtual interface corresponding that corresponds to an APN, it requests to the PDN GW deletion of the GTP tunnel, or the PMIP tunnel for this APN as per steps 2-5 of respectively subclause 16.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [5] in case of GTP-based S2a, or subclause 16.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [5] in case of PMIP-based S2a, or disconnects NSWO if the virtual interface corresponds to NSWO (step 2b).
```{=html}
``` 6\. The TWAG then sends a DHCP reply to the UE to confirm release of the
IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address for the PDN connection or the NSWO access.
  1. The UE then deletes the virtual IP interface for the virtual point-to-point link corresponding the PDN connection, or to NSWO.
##### 8.2.2.1.5 HSS/AAA Initiated PDN or NSWO Disconnection procedure in WLAN
Figure 8.2.2.1.5-1: HSS/AAA Initiated Detach on GTP S2a
Figure 8.2.2.1.5-2: HSS/AAA Initiated Detach on PMIP S2a
The procedure for HSS/AAA Initiated Detach from TWAN is represented in Figure
8.2.2.1.5-1 in case of GTP-based S2a and Figure 8.2.2.1.5-2 in case of PMIP-
based S2a and described below:
1) The HSS/AAA sends a Session Termination Request message to the TWAN to
detach a specific UE.
2) The step 2 to 5 of the UE/TWAN Initiated PDN or NSWO Disconnection
procedure described in clause 8.2.2.1.4 are followed.
3) The TWAG force the UE to renew its IPv4 and/or IPv6 address(es) by sending
a DHCP FORCERENEW message as per IETF RFC 3203 [24] or DHCPv6 Reconfigure
message as per IETF RFC 3315 [23]. The DHCP FORCERENEW message is secured via
Forcerenew Nonce Authentication as per RFC 6704 [29]. When the UE proceeds
with renewing the address lease for the APN or NSWO, the TWAG can in turn
refuse to do so, notifying to the UE that the PDN or NSWO has been
disconnected.
4) TWAN sends a Session Termination Response message to 3GPP AAA Server. If
the detach procedure was initiated from the 3GPP AAA Server and if the UE no
longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server
communicates this to the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2 of 3GPP TS 23.402
[5]. If the detach procedure was initiated by HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server replies
to the HSS as described in clause 12.1.3 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [5].
##### 8.2.2.1.6 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach procedure in WLAN
This procedure is similar as per subclause 16.3.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [5].
##### 8.2.2.1.7 Handover from 3GPP Access to Trusted WLAN Access
Figure 8.2.2.1.7-1: Handover from 3GPP Access to Trusted WLAN Access
In a second execution step, the UE explicitly requests handover of a PDN
connection to a specific APN as per the following steps depicted in Figure
8.2.2.1.7-1 for GTP-based S2a and Figure 8.2.2.1.7-2 for PMIP-based S2a:
> 0\. The UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a GTP or PMIP tunnel on
> the S5/S8 interface.
>
> 1\. The UE creates a WLAN virtual IP interface corresponding to the APN
> towards which it desires to handover a PDN connection.
>
> 2\. The UE requests handover of the PDN connection from the 3GPP access to
> this WLAN virtual interface by sending a DHCP and/or DHCPv6 request message
> from this WLAN virtual interface that contains a handover indication for the
> PDN connection. The handover indication consists of requesting allocation of
> the same IPV4 address than previously allocated for the PDN connection over
> the 3GPP access, or of an IPv6 address within the same IPv6 prefix than
> previously allocated for the PDN connection over the 3GPP access. The DHCP
> requests are transmitted over the virtual point-to-point link negotiated
> during authentication phase, i.e., the layer 2 frame carrying the DHCP is
> marked with the corresponding VLAN Id, or unicasted to the corresponding
> TWAG MAC address, or encapsulated with the corresponding GRE key.
NOTE: The UE is not required to request re-allocation of all addresses it had
previously been allocated over the 3GPP access; a single request for one of
the addresses that were used over the 3GPP access is enough to signal a
handover indication to the TWAG. The UE may however request allocation for as
many addresses as it wishes. Hence for an IPv4v6 PDN connection the handover
indication signalling may be based entirely on DHCPv4 with no use of DHCPv6.
If that is the case the UE may configure with Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration the same IPv6 address than previously allocated with
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration for the PDN connection over the 3GPP
access based on receiving from the TWAG the same IPv6 prefix in a router
advertisement.
> 3\. When the TWAG receives the first DHCP IPv4 and/or IPv6 address
> allocation request with a handover indication over the virtual point-to-
> point link corresponding to a specific APN, it request the PDN GW handover

> This is done by sending a Create Session Request or Proxy Binding Update
> with the handover indication for each of the PDN connections to the same
> APN. In case of multiple PDN connections to a same APN, the steps 3-5 in (A)
> shall be repeated for each PDN connection to the same APN that is being

##### 8.2.2.1.8 Handover from Trusted WLAN Access to 3GPP Access
This procedure is as described in subclause 8.2.1.3 of TS 23.402 for GTP-based
S5/S8, with the difference that there is a GTP tunnel instead of a PMIP tunnel
in step 1 in case of GTP-based S2a, and that the resource allocation
deactivation procedure initiated by the PDN GW in step 17 is as defined in
clause 16.4 of TS 23.402, followed by the additional step of the UE then
deleting the virtual IP interface for the virtual point-to-point link
corresponding the PDN connection.
#### 8.2.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes or functionality

#### 8.2.2.3 Evaluation
.
The following aspects are considered and evaluated for the solution:
i) Impacts to existing network deployment:
    a.  There is no requirement for WLAN APs compared to Rel-11.
    b.  The TWAG shall support the point-to-point link multiplexing, the
        EAP-AKA enhancements, and the binding of an IPv4 and/or IPv6
        session(s) for stateful address configuration with a PDN
        connection.
ii) Impacts to UE:
```{=html}
``` a) The UE shall support the point-to-point link multiplexing, the AAA
enhancements, and the binding of an IPv4 and/or IPv6 session(s) for stateful
address configuration with a PDN connection.
```{=html}
``` iii) Impacts to 3GPP protocols/extensions (e.g. EAP AKA'):
> The following protocols are extended:
a) EAP-AKA is extended with UE network capability negotiation and PDN point-
to-point link management (APN, PDN type, point-to-point link identifiers)
b) STa protocol is extended with UE network capability negotiation and PDN
point-to-point link management (APN, PDN type, point-to-point link
identifiers).
```{=html}
``` iv) Impacts to protocols defined by other SDOs (e.g. DHCP):
> No impact on other SDOs.
v) Control plane
```{=html}
``` a) The latency/load of first PDN connection is as for phase 1 SaMOG, i.e.,
EAP-AKA based authentication and IP layer address configuration. The
latency/load of additional PDN connections is less as it only requires IP
layer configuration.
b) There is impact on the AAA server as it needs to be enhanced with the EAP-
AKA extensions and the STa extensions.
```{=html}
``` vi) Compliance to clause 8.1 SaMOG phase-2 system requirements:
```{=html}
``` a) Co-existence with Rel-11 SaMOG
b) Support for IP address preservation during handover
c) Simultaneous support for S2a EPC-routed and NSWO; support of simultaneous
multiple PDN connections
```{=html}
``` vii) Other functional limitations:
     a.  Limitation on the number of point-to-point links to specific
         > APNs that can be negotiated -- but no different from limit on
         > number of bearers on 3GPP access.
     b.  Limitation that APNs the UE will connect to have to be known
         > prior to WLAN authentication phase. Were it not the case,
         > connection to an unforeseen APN when the UE is already
         > authenticated to WLAN would require UE to disconnect and
         > reconnect to the WLAN such that the new APN can be negotiated
         > in EAP-AKA authentication. The UE disconnecting and
         > reconnecting from WLAN may cause the UE to release existing
         > PDN connections anchored over the TWAN.

> NOTE: The solution does not support stateless auto-configuration DHCPv6.
##### 8.2.3.1.1 Functional Overview and Overall System Impacts
###### 8.2.3.1.1.1 Overview
The following table summarizes the proposed solution with respect to the
Rel-12 SaMOG system requirements.
Table 8.2.3.1.1.1- : Solution overview
###### 8.2.3.1.1.2 UE Impacts
For the purpose of accessing a Trusted Non-3GPP WLAN Access, the UE will be
modified with the following enhancements with respect to Rel-11 UE:
  * Control Plane:
> \- Incorporate the requested APN, uplink GRE key, and HO indication in DHCP
> request message to communicate with TWAN/EPC.
>
> \- Support SAMOG phase 2 capabilities exchange and negotiation with TWAN
> during the EAP Authentication and Authorization operation.

> and receive the indication via DHCP response message.
>
> \- Support IPv4, IPv6 and dual-stack PDN connection corresponding to the
> UE's subscription policy with its operator
>

>
> \- Set-up and release the NSWO access.
>
> \- Support multiple simultaneous (TWAN) connectivity services i.e. both EPC-
> routed and NSWO simultaneously.
>
> \- Decide on the unique downlink GRE key for the EPC-routed traffic across
> all the PDN connections and sent it to TWAN, and also track the uplink GRE
> key that is assigned by the TWAN
  * User Plane:
> \- Encapsulate and decapsulate GRE-over-IP tunnel for its EPC-routed PDN
> connection
>
> \- Simultaneous support for EPC-routed and NSWO traffic
###### 8.2.3.1.1.3 Trusted WLAN Access Gateway Impacts
The Trusted WLAN Access Gateway is enhanced with respect to Rel-11 TWAG with
the following functions:
  * Control Plane:
> \- Support the TWAN side of the operations corresponding to UE's operation
> as described in clause 8.2.3.1.1.2 above.
>
> \- Binding the PDN connection for S2a GTP/PMIP tunnel.
  * User Plane:
\- Enforces routing of packets between the PDN connection and the GTP/PMIP
tunnel for that UE.
\- Encapsulate and decapsulate GRE-over-IP tunnel for its EPC-routed PDN
connection
  * Simultaneous support for EPC-routed and NSWO traffic
###### 8.2.3.1.1.4 Trusted WLAN Access Point Impacts
None
###### 8.2.3.1.1.5 Trusted WLAN Backhaul Impacts
Same as SaMOG Rel-11
##### 8.2.3.1.2 Control Plane Management
###### 8.2.3.1.2.1 UE-Network Capability Negotiation
The UE negotiates SaMOG phase 2 capabilities with its serving TWAN during its
EAP Authentication and Authorization operation. The TWAN sends UE requested
SaMOG phase 2 capabilities and local TWAN configuration policies (i.e. whether
supporting NSWO and/or EPC-routed) to the 3GPP AAA server over STa interface.
The 3GPP AAA server takes a decision on whether or not the capabilities may
apply to the UE session on the TWAN based on UE's subscription policy and
local TWAN policies.
###### 8.2.3.1.2.2 Connection related control plan interface
DHCP protocol is used as the connection related control plane interface
between the UE and the TWAG. It is the control plane protocol for UE to
trigger the setup/maintain and release of any PDN or NSWO access among
multiple connections:
  * Allows the UE to set-up (or Handover) and release a specific PDN or multiple PDNs.
  * Allows the UE to set-up and release the NSWO access.
> NOTE 1: For DHCPv4 Forcerenew message used for releasing an individual PDN,
> RFC6704 [27] "DHCP Forcerenew nonce authentication" shall be used to provide
> secure client/server signaling exchange .
>
> NOTE 2: For DHCPv6, RFC 3315 [23] specifies security mechanism to protect
> client/server signaling exchange .
  * Allows the UE to have multiple simultaneous (TWAN) connectivity services.
  * Allows the UE to indicate the desired connectivity service (NSWO access/PDN), whether an initial attach or a handover is required, the PDN type, etc.
> NOTE 3: 3GPP Vendor-specific Information that has been assigned by IETF for
> 3GPP for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 can be used to provide DHCP enhancement as
> required by this solution. Hence, there is no impact to IETF.
##### 8.2.3.1.3 User plane management
######
Basic assumption of SaMOG is to have point-to-point underlying transport
between the UE and TWAG within the TWAN. However, when emulating multiple S2a
PDNs support over TWAN, it is possible that several UE's serving PDN GWs could
allocate the same private IP(v4) address to an UE. Hence, a user plane
connection identifier is required to support multiplexing multiple PDNs over
the point-to-point link between the UE and the TWAG to support TWAN
connectivity service i.e. EPC-routed traffic.
In the following two subsections, two alternatives are proposed for the user
plane connection identifier.
> Editor\'s Notes: For which of these two alternatives needs to be chosen is
> FFS.
###### 8.2.3.1.3.1 Alternative 1: GRE over IP
8.2.3.1.3.1.1 Point-to-point link model and multiple PDN connections support
In this alternative, a unique pair of per-UE based GRE Keys in the uplink and
in downlink direction is required for differentiating individual PDN.
As there is no need to manage bearers over the WLAN access, a GRE Key at the
user plane interface between the UE and the TWAG, corresponds to an entire
PDN. When different GTP-u bearers are used on S2a for a given PDN, it is the
same mechanism used in Rel-11 SaMOG to determine the GTP-u bearer to be used
to carry a given packet i.e. the usage of UL-TFT at the UE and DL-TFT at the
PGW.
NOTE 1: The figures in the following sections depict the case of a PDN using a
single bearer over S2a.
Figure 8.2.3.1.3.1.1-1: Point-to-point link model for PDN and NSWO access
based on distinct GRE Key
As depicted in the Figure 8.2.3.1.3.1.1-1 above, there are separate uplink and
downlink GRE Keys. The virtual point-to-point link corresponding to a given
connectivity service is realized as enforcing the packet forwarding of uplink
and downlink traffic from different PDNs of which the IP packets are
identified by specific GRE Key.
The solution described above supports one or multiple PDN(s) corresponding
with one or more APN(s).
###### # 8.2.3.1.3.1.2 GRE over IP tunneling establishment
It is assumed that a given 3GPP UE is always hosted by only one TWAG within
the TWAN. Both the UE and the TWAG guarantees the uniqueness of GRE Key across
all the 3GPP UE's PDNs. Each PDN is identified by both uplink GRE Key and
downlink GRE Key.
Figure 8.2.3.1.3.1.2 -1 shows the user data encapsulated in GRE tunnel.
Figure 8.2.3.1.3.1.2-1: Encapsulation of UE EPC-routed Traffic in GRE Tunnel
###### 8.2.3.1.3.2 Alternative 2: TWAG virtual MAC Address
In this alternative, a TWAG virtual MAC address in the uplink and in downlink
direction is required for differentiating individual PDN.
As there is no need to manage bearers over the WLAN access, a TWAG virtual MAC
address at the user plane interface between the UE and the TWAG, corresponds
to an entire PDN. When different GTP-u bearers are used on S2a for a given
PDN, it is the same mechanism used in Rel-11 SaMOG to determine the GTP-u
bearer to be used to carry a given packet i.e. the usage of UL-TFT at the UE
and DL-TFT at the PGW. On the UL direction, the TWAG uses both the source MAC
address and the TWAG virtual MAC address to identify the S2a bearer on which
the packet is to be forwarded. Two different UEs served by the same TWAG can
share the same TWAG virtual MAC address.
Figure 8.2.3.1.3.2-1: Point-to-point link model for PDN and NSWO access based
on TWAG VMAC
##### 8.2.3.1.4 Protocol stack
The following mobility protocols are supported over S2a:
  * GTP.
  * PMIPv6.
The link model as well as IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix allocation
considerations are equally valid for GTP and PMIPv6 S2a options.
The figure below illustrates the control plane for Tunnel Management and the
user plane for GTP option.

Figure 8.2.3.1.4-1: Link Model for GTP-based S2a
When PMIP based S2a is used with Trusted WLAN, the PMIPv6 protocol stacks
described in TS 23.402 clause 6.1.1 apply.
##### 8.2.3.1.5 IP addressing support for SaMOG phase-2
This clause describes the IP addressing support for SaMOG phase-2 based on the
stateful DHCP-based solution. The main scenarios for IP address/prefix
assignment to UE are:
a) The IP address allocated by TWAN which is used for NSWO access
b) The IP address allocated by TWAN for GRE over IP tunnelling the EPC routed
traffic,
c) The IPv4 address/IPv6 prefix allocated by PGW which is used for EPC routed.
###### 8.2.3.1.5.1 IP address assignment for NSWO
If the requested connectivity is for NSWO and the NSWO connectivity is allowed
by the user subscription, the TWAN shall assign a NSWO IP address or prefix
via DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 procedures.
###### 8.2.3.1.5.2 IP address assignment for GRE over IP tunnel
In the case when additional PDN connection is requested, and the multiple PDN
connectivity is allowed, the TWAN shall assign the tunnel IP address via
DHCPv4 if TWAN support IPv4; otherwise, the TWAN supports IPv6, the UE may
generate link local address to be used for GRE over IP tunnelling.
###### 8.2.3.1.5.3 IP address assignment for EPC-routed
The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is allocated to the UE by PDN GW or
external PDN when a new PDN connection is established. In order to enable IPv4
or IPv6 connectivity, the TWAN shall support DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server
functionality for IP parameter configuration and IPv4 address and/or IPv6
prefix allocation as specified in IETF RFC 2131 [9] and IETF RFC 3315 [23].
The way that the UE sets the requested PDN type is as specified in sub-clasue
5.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [6].
The following IP address allocation procedure applies to the following
conditions accordingly:
\- If the requested PDN type is allowed by the user subscription, the TWAN
requests the PDN connectivity towards EPC as requested.
\- If the requested PDN type is IPv4v6, but the subscription data allows only
PDN type IPv4 or only PDN type IPv6, the TWAN requests IPv4 address or IPv6
prefix in the Proxy Binding Update or GTP Create Session Request from the PDN
GW according to the subscribed value. The TWAN shall return the assigned PDN
type to the UE. In this case the UE shall not request another PDN connection
to the same APN for the other IP version. The IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix is
delivered to the TWAN during the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel establishment.
a). When the UE requests the IPv4 address via DHCPv4, and if the subscription
data allows PDN type IPv4, the TWAN delivers the received IPv4 address to the
UE within DHCPv4 signalling after the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established
between the TWAN and the PDN GW. Otherwise, the subscription data allows only
PDN type IPv6, TWAN will reject the request with a cause value that PDN type
IPv6 only.
b). When the UE requests the IPv6 prefix via DHCPv6, and if the subscription
data allows PDN type IPv6, the TWAN delivers the received IPv6 address to the
UE within DHCPv6 signalling after the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established
between the TWAN and the PDN GW. Otherwise, the subscription data allows only
PDN type IPv4, TWAN will reject the request with a cause value that PDN type
IPv4 only.
\- If the requested PDN type is IPv4 or IPv6, and if either the requested PDN
type or PDN type IPv4v6 are subscribed, the TWAN requested the PDN
connectivity from the PDN GW as requested. Otherwise the requested PDN
connection request is rejected with the appropriate cause value.
\- If the requested PDN type is IPv4v6, and both IPv4 and IPv6 PDN types are
allowed by subscription but not IPv4v6, the TWAN shall decide for which the
PDN type that it will request and such decision is operator's implementation
decision.
#### 8.2.3.2 Procedures
> Editor\'s Note: The call flows are described in this subclause.
##### 8.2.3.2.1 Initial Attach in WLAN on S2a
###### 8.2.3.2.1.1 Initial Attach in WLAN on GTP/PMIP S2a
Figure 8.2.3.2.1.1-1: Initial attachment in WLAN on GTP/PMIP S2a for roaming,
LBO and non-roaming scenarios
The scenario is defined as the TWAN using the layer 3 attach request,
including a DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 message, sent by the UE as the attach trigger.
1\. The step is same as step 1 in TS 23.402 [3] clause 16.2.1.
2\. In this step, the UE indicates its capability (i.e. Rel-12 SaMOG
capability) to the AAA server during the authentication procedure. Based on
the UE capability provided by AAA server, the TWAN decides to use L3 trigger.
3\. The UE shall send a DHCPv4 Discover as per IETF RFC 2131 [9], or DHCPv6
Solicit as per IETF RFC 3315[23] to TWAN, including the following information,
  * The requested APN
```{=html}
``` \- An indication on the requested access (EPC via S2a access or the use of

The scenario is defined as the TWAN using the layer 3 attach request,
including DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 message, sent by the UE as the PDN trigger. NSWO is
a special PDN.
For DHCPv4 messaging and security handling, RFC 6704 shall be applied.
  1. The UE shall send layer 3 attach request to the TWAN, (e.g. a DHCPv4 discover as per IETF RFC 2131 [9]ï¼Œ DHCPv6 Solicit as per IETF RFC3315 [23]),including requested APN, requested PDN type and an indication on the requested access (EPC via S2a access or the use of NSWO access), and for alternative 1, the downlink GRE key if EPC via S2a access.

  1. If the PDN Type is IPv4, UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 release message or IPv4 address lease time expires in TS23.402 [3] clause 16.3. And if the PDN Type is IPv6, UE releases the IPv6 address using DHCPv6 release message or IPv6 address lease time expires. If the PDN Type is IPv4v6, UE shall releases the IPv4 address and IPv6 address by the first DHCP release session, i.e. DHCPv4 release message or DHCPv6 release message, with PDN Type for IPv4v6 is included in the message.
     * Alternative 1:
> For DHCPv4 release message, a specific GRE key or a client id is used for

2-5. After TWAN receives DHCP release message, it shall detect if the PDN
supports IPv4v6 dual stack and PDN type for IPv4v6 is included in the message.
If so, TWAN shall send delete session request message to PDN GW, in order to
indicate PDN GW for deleting the PDN. Steps 3-5 are same as the steps 2-5 in
TS23.402 [3] clause 16.3.1.1.
6\. TWAN shall remove the associated contexts corresponding to specific PDN,
and send Reply messageto inform UE of removing associated contexts in the case
of DHCPv6.
7\. If TWAN requested Single PDN Disconnection, TWAN shall send a DHCPv4
FORCERENEW message as per IETF RFC 3203 [24] and RFC6704[27], and/or DHCPv6
Reconfigure message as per IETF RFC 3315 [23]. When the UE proceeds with
renewing the address lease for single PDN, the TWAN shall in turn refuse the
request and notify to the UE that the PDN has been disconnected.
NOTE: For PDN type is IPv4v6, it is FFS.

When the PDN Type is IPv4v6, UE shall release the IPv4 address using DHCPv4
release message or IPv4 address lease time expires in TS23.402 [3] clause
16.3, and release the IPv6 address using DHCPv6 release message or IPv6
address lease time expires separately.
The scenario applies that UE/TWAN deletes one IPv4 address or one IPv6 address
for a Dual Stack PDN first, and subsequently, UE/TWAN deletes the PDN.
1\. UE sends DHCPv4 release message to TWAN if UE releases IPv4 address
first,including PDN Type for IPv4.

2\. In case that TWAN receives DHCPv4 release message, then, IP type is IPv4
and TWAN indicates PDN GW for deleting IPv4 address from the PDN. In case that
TWAN receives DHCPv6 release message, then, IP type is IPv6 and TWAN indicates
PDN GW for deleting IPv6 address from the PDN.
If TWAN requested IP release, TWAN decides the order of deleting IPv4 address
and IPv6 address, If TWAN decides to delete IPv4 first, TWAN sets the IP type
to be IPv4 and indicates PDN GW for deleting IPv4 address from the PDN. If
TWAN decides to delete IPv6 address first, TWAN sets the IP type to be IPv6
and indicates PDN GW for deleting IPv6 address from the PDN.
TWAN checks there are two associated IPv4 address and IPv6 address for the
PDN, and sends modify Bearer Request to PDN GW, including the indication for
IP type to be deleted, in order to indicate PDN GW for deleting this type of
IP from the PDN.
3\. PDN GW initiates the IPâ€‘CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF.
4\. PDN GW sends modify Bearer response to TWAN.
If there are multiple bearers corresponding to the PDN, then steps 2-4 are
repeated.
5\. TWAN shall remove the associated contexts corresponding to specific PDN,
send Reply message in the case of DHCPv6, and inform UE of removing associated
contexts.
6\. If TWAN requested IP release, TWAN shall send a DHCPv4 FORCERENEW message
as per IETF RFC 3203 [24] and RFC6704 [27], or DHCPv6 Reconfigure message as
per IETF RFC 3315 [23]. When the UE proceeds with renewing the IPv4 address or
IPv6 address lease, the TWAN shall in turn refuse to do so, notifying to the
UE that the IPv4 address or IPv6 address has been released.
Subsequently, when UE sends DHCPv6 release (if DHCPv4 release is sent in step
1) or DHCPv4 release (if DHCPv6 release is sent in step 1) message, TWAN shall
disconnect the PDN. If TWAN requested IP release, then TWAN shall send delete
session request message to PDN GW, in order to disconnect the PDN.

message or IPv4 address lease time expires in TS23.402 [3] clause 16.3. And if
the PDN Type is IPv6, UE releases the IPv6 address using DHCPv6 release
message or IPv6 address lease time expires. If the PDN Type is IPv4v6, UE
shall releases the IPv4 address and IPv6 address by the first DHCP release

2-5. TWAN sends delete Session Request to PDN GW, in order to indicate PDN GW
for deleting one PDN. The steps 2-5 are same as steps 2-5 in TS23.402 [3]
clause 16.3.1.1.
6\. Repeat steps 2-5 above for remainder PDNs if multiple PDNs are
established.
7\. TWAN shall de-authenticate and de-associate the UE at layer 2 according to
IEEE STD 802.11-207 [5] , send Reply message to UE in the case of DHCPv6 and
informing UE of removing associated contexts.
8\. If TWAN requested Detach, the TWAN locally removes the UE contexts and de-
authenticates and disassociates the UE at Layer 2 according to IEEE Std.
802.11-2007 [5].
###### # 8.2.3.2.3.1.4 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach Procedure in WLAN on GTP S2a
Figure 8.2.3.2.3.1.4-1: HSS/AAA Initiated Detach on GTP S2a
The procedure for HSS/AAA Initiated Detach from TWAN is represented in Figure
8.2.3.2.3.1.4-1 and described below.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local
Breakout cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages
between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Home Routed Roaming and LBO cases,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming and Home
Routed Roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.
1) The HSS/AAA sends a Session Termination Request message to the TWAN to
detach a specific UE.
2) The step 2 to 5 of the UE/TWAN Initiated Detach procedure described in
clause 8.2.3.2.3.1.3 above are followed.
3) If additional PDNs exist, step 2 is implemented for each PDN.
4) During the step, TWAN shall de-authenticate and de-associate the UE at
layer 2 according to IEEE STD 802.11-207 [5], and inform UE to remove the
associated contexts.
5) TWAN sends a Session Termination Response message to 3GPP AAA Server,
respectively. If the detach procedure was initiated from the 3GPP AAA Server
and if the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA
Server communicates the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2 TS23.402. If the
detach procedure was initiated by HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server replies to the HSS
as described in clause 12.1.3 TS23.402.
NOTE: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW. The
PDN GW does not remove the GTP tunnels on S2a, since the TWAN is responsible
for removing the GTP tunnels on S2a. The PDN GW acknowledges the receipt of
the detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA Server.

###### 8.2.3.2.4.1 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN
on GTP S2a
This procedure can be used to deactivate an S2a dedicated bearer or deactivate
all S2a bearers belonging to a PDN address, e.g., due to IPâ€‘CAN session
modification requests from the PCRF. If the default S2a bearer belonging to a
PDN is deactivated, the PDN GW deactivates all S2a bearers belonging to the
PDN.
Figure 8.2.3.2.4.1-1: PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation with GTP on S2a
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Roaming and Local Breakout cases.
In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and
the hPCRF. In the non-roaming and home routed roaming cases, the vPCRF is not
involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the PDN GW and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 16..4.1-1 occur only if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured within the PDN GW.
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Bearer Deactivation
procedure may be triggered, for example, due to \'IPâ€‘CAN session Modification
procedure\', as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, the resources
associated with the PDN in the PDN GW are released.
2\. The PDN GW sends a Delete Bearer Request message (EPS Bearer Identity,
Cause) to the TWAN. This message can include an indication that all bearers
belonging to that PDN shall be released.
3\. If supported by the TWAN, the TWAN shall remove the associated contexts
corresponding to specific PDNs, and inform UE to remove the associated
contexts.
4\. The TWAN deletes the bearer contexts related to the Delete Bearer Request
message, and acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the PDN GW by sending a
Delete Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity) message.
5\. In the case of the resources corresponding to the PDN are released in PDN
GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server/HSS of the PDN disconnection.
6\. The PDN GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated S2a
bearer. If the dedicated bearer deactivation procedure was triggered by
receiving a PCC decision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the
PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was successfully enforced by
completing the PCRF-initiated IPâ€‘CAN Session Modification procedure or the
PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203
[19], proceeding after the completion of IPâ€‘CAN bearer signalling.

The procedure is similar to GTP S2a call flow in clause 8.2.3.2.4.1, with the
following differences:
\- Step 2 is a Binding Revocation Indication message. The parameters in the
Binding Revocation Indication message are same as step 2 in clause
8.2.3.2.4.1.

1-2) These steps are the same as steps 1-3 in TS 23.402 [3], clause 8.2.2.
3\. In this step, indication on whether the UE indicates its capability (i.e.
Rel-12 SaMOG capability) to the AAA server during the authentication
procedure. Based on the UE capability provided by AAA server, the TWAN decides
to use L3 trigger.
4\. The UE shall send a DHCPv4 Discover as per IETF RFC 2131 [9], or DHCPv6
confirm as per IETF RFC3315[23] to TWAN with "requested IP address" included
in DHCPv4 Discover message (option 50)/ DHCPv6 Confirm message (option IA_NA)
with all previously assigned UE IP addresses prior to its handover. TWAN
determines IP address preservation by the presence of the "requested IP
address" option. APN, PDN Type and downlink GRE key (for alternative 1) shall
also be included.
5\. The TWAN sends a Create Session Request (APN PDN address, Handover
Indication) message to the PDN GW. The PDN Address shall be set according to
requested IP address for DHCP request message in step 4ï¼Œand sent to the PDN
GW. The TWAN sets the \'Handover Indication\' to allow the PDN GW to re-
allocate the same IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address that was assigned to the UE
while it was connected to 3GPP IP access and to initiate an IP CAN Session
Modification Procedure with the PCRF. Both the APN and PDN Address are used by
the PDN GW to determine which PDN to establish connectivity for, in the case
that the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connectivity.
6) This steps is same as steps 7A-7B in TS 23.402 [3], clause 8.2.2.
7) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN and obtains authorization information from the
3GPP AAA Server. The 3GPP AAA Server decides whether or not to update PDN GW
identification according to the UE capability, which has been provided at the
authentication phase. If the UE supports IP address preservation, the 3GPP AAA
Server shall update PDN GW identity towards the HSS.
8\. The PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response to the TWAN. The Create
Session Response contains the IPv4 address and/or the IPv6 address that were
assigned to the UE while it was connected to the 3GPP IP access.
9\. GTP tunnel is setup between TWAN and PDN GW.
10\. For DHCPv4, TWAN returns DHCP offer message to UE, TWAG virtual MAC
address is included if alternative 2 is used.
11\. UE sends DHCP Request (for DHCPv4) to TWAN, and TWAN returns DHCP Ack
message to the UE and UE IP allocated by PDN GW.
a) Alternative 1: GRE tunnelling information is included to UE, where GRE
tunnel information includes uplink GRE key and UE's local IP address which are
allocated by TWAN for tunnelling support in the case of one or multiple PDNs.
b) Alternative 2: Both UE and TWAN maintain the relations of TWAG virtual MAC
address and associated UE information, including IMSI, APN, UE IP address.
12\. TWAN returns Reply message to the UE, and UE IP allocated by PDN GW.
a) Alternative 1: GRE tunnelling information is included to UE, where GRE
tunnel information includes uplink GRE key and UE's local IP address which are

are encapsulated by the GRE key which is allocated in step 12.
  * Alternative 2:
(a) If UE requests IPv4 address first, TWAN shall implement steps 10-11 and
return IPv4 address to UE. Subsequently, when UE requests IPv6 address, it

and steps 3 to 12 are repeated for per PDN, with the following exception:
  * Handover indication isn't included in step 5.

##### 8.2.4.1.1 P2P link
A per UE point-to-point link between the UE and the TWAG is assumed.
The TWAG performs unicast layer 2 forwarding even when layer 3 is multicast
address (e.g. Router Advertisement, RFC 6085).

In IPv4 case, the multiple PDN may use the same IP multicast address for
different services, the source IP address in general could be used to
disambiguate the multicast services.

> services are FFS.
### 8.2.5 Solution 5: Associating APN/PDN with Virtual IP Interface
#### 8.2.5.1 Functional Description
> Editor\'s Notes: It should be described whether and how the solution fulfils
> the requirements in Subclause 8.1.
##### 8.2.5.1.1 General
This section describes in general the point-to-point link/IP forwarding and
the control sequence for associating an APN/NSWO to a point-to-point link. The
session control protocol carries the APN/PDN signalling attributes and uses
distinct Gateway interface (gateway IP address, MAC address) for the
connection to associate the APN in IP configuration signalling (DHCP for IPv4,
stateless autoconfiguration for IPv6).
**[Point-to-Point Link]{.underline}**
The point-to-point link in this solution uses the distinct MAC address per
APN/NSWO at the gateway as described in subclause 8.2.2.1.1.2 for packet
forwarding. In addition to a distinct MAC address, this solution has a
distinct TWAG Gateway Interface per APN/NSWO connection. A TWAG Gateway
Interface for a connection consists of an IP address and a MAC address -- each
of which is distinct for connections to a UE.
Figure 8.2.5.1.1-1: Point-to-Point Link
**[PDN Control Protocol]{.underline}** The PDN control protocol is used to
signal APN/PDN information between UE TWAN. This protocol also associates the
APN/NSWO connection request to a distinct gateway IP address/MAC address prior
to IP configuration using DHCP, RS/RA. The gateway IP address is derived from
the MAC address and there is a 1:1 association between the distinct gateway
MAC address and the gateway IP address. For IP configuration signalling using
DHCP or RS/RA, the TWAG can uniquely associate a UEs PDN connection using UE
MAC address (or IPv6 link layer address) and this gateway interface (IP
address, virtual MAC address) that is distinct for each PDN connection of the
UE.
For IPv4 stateful address configuration, the UE provides a PDN connection
request and the TWAG returns this distinct gateway IP address as input for
server-identity in DHCP request. In the subsequent DHCP Request from UE, the
server-identity is populated with this distinct gateway IP address as a means
for the TWAG to identify the PDN connection.
For IPv6 stateless address configuration, the UE provides an PDN connection
request and the TWAG returns this distinct gateway IP address and also
populates the same gateway IP address in a Router Advertisement that follows.
For cases where the UE needs to send a Router Solicitation (optional), the
TWAG also returns a transient multicast address corresponding to this PDN
connection that the TWAG listens to. The UE may send a Router Solicitation
with destination address set to this transient multicast address that is
distinct for this PDN connection.
If UE request handover from 3GPP to WLAN access, it indicates handover attach
in the control protocol.
If the UE needs to setup a second PDN connection, this can be signalled in a
subsequent connection setup request. For disconnection of a PDN connection,
either the UE or the TWAN may notify the other about an IP address/prefix that
is released. The notified entity can then release the local connection
resources.
The PDN Control Protocol described above consists of requests / responses or
notification messages and requires a transport for these messages. Two
alternative transport protocols are considered here:
  * **Alternative A: ICMP Echo Payload**
> ICMP Echo [RFC 792] is typically used to verify if another host is active.
> However, it is possible to add an arbitrary data payload following the ICMP
> header as long as it is echoed back, and this solution uses the data payload
> to carry binary encoded connnection control messages each of which is an
> ICMP Echo Request and Response. The PDN Control Protocol is identified by a
> unique sequence identifier (e.g. 0xFCFCFC) that follows the ICMP Echo
> message and precedes the PDN control protocol frame. The data payload of the
> ICMP Echo messages maybe authenticated (message authentication) using a
> hashed key each for UE and TWAG (established during EAP-AKA). Only one set
> of keys are established between UE -- TWAG and either the link local address
> or the NSWO IP connection may be used for this signalling.\ \ Reliability of
> this control sequence is provided by virtue of receiving the echoed message.
> For re-transmission, this method re-uses the DHCP re-transmission timer
> value. No support for fragmentation is provided and is not necessary for the
> control protocol.\ \ The ICMP Echo payload mechanism uses existing ICMP
> protocol semantics and does not violate IETF RFC 792. Only the control
> messages need to be standardized (in 3GPP).The mechanism is basic and is
> efficient enough even if messages are echoed back since only a limited
> amount of control signalling required and is always across one IP hop.
  * **Alternative B: 802.11 GAS frame**
> 802.11 GAS frames can be used to carry the PDN control protocol frames
> similar to the transport of ANQP/GAS between UE -- WLAN Access Point. These
> control frames could then be carried to the TWAG over RADIUS or other
> similar protocol. The control protocol semantics are the same as in
> Alternative A above.\ \ Reliability of this control sequence is provided
> using 802.11 GAS and the backhaul protocol (e.g. RADIUS). Re-transmission
> timers re-use the DHCP re-transmission timer value. No fragmentation is
> expected as the signalling is expected to be well below the size of an
> Ethernet frame.\ \ The PDN Control protocol would be defined as a new GAS
> protocol in WFA as part of HS2.0 Rel-3 specifications. The protocol would
> use the WMM Notification Action frames as a L2 transport fover the 802.11
> air interface. In addition, RADIUS protocol messages Accept-Request/Response
> (for PDN Request/Response) and Change-of-Authorization (for Notification)
> should carry this protocol from AP -- TWAN controllers. This underlying
> mechanism provides a reliable control protocol transport. As in the case
> above, DHCP re-transmission timer values may be used.
Editor's Note: Selection of one of the control transport protocols is FFS.
Editor\'s Notes: For uplink broadcasts signalling (e.g. IPv6 RS, IPv6 ND, ARP,
and service discovery requests (e.g. DLNA) generally sent using a L2 (MAC)
broadcast address:
  * when the destination MAC address used over WLAN is a broadcast address and not the TWAG MAC address associated with a TWAN connectivity service, a specific handling would be required at the TWAN to handle such traffic or
  * the UE uses a unicast MAC addressing for such traffic as described in RFC 6085 "Address Mapping of IPv6 Multicast Packets on Ethernet " for the IPv6 case. Using such technique for IPv4 is FFS.
#### 8.2.5.2 Procedures
> Editor\'s Notes: The call flows are described in this subclause.
##### 8.2.5.2.2 Connection Establishment Procedure
The connection establishment procedures below support both PDN connection
establishment and NSWO connections. In the case of PDN connections, the
signalling from UE to TWAN explicitly provides the APN that the UE wishes to
connect to. For NSWO connections, the UE indicates NSWO request or signal that
it wants a local IP address.
The figures below outline GTP S2a, PMIP S2a and NSWO connection setup.
Figure 8.2.5.2.2-1: Attach Procedure for PDN and NSWO for GTP based S2a
The procedure to attach PDN or NSWO for a trusted WLAN access is represented
in Figure 8.2.5.2.2-1 and described below:
  1. The initial TWAN specific L2 procedures are performed. These procedures are TWAN specific and outside the scope of 3GPP.
  2. EAP authentication procedures are performed. During this sequence, support of Phase 2 by the UE and TWAG are conveyed using EAP-AKA [RFC 4187] extensions. If the UE, TWAG are Phase 2 compliant, the UE and TWAG setup and exchange keys to be used to provide integrity protection (e.g. checksum hash) for the subsequent signalling setup messages.\ After successful authentication, in step 2b, for ICMP Payload transport of PDN signalling protocol, the UE sets up a link-local address for IPv4 (RFC 3927), or follows the procedure in RFC 4861 to setup an IPv6 link local address. The TWAG replies with a control-initialize message with source router IP, MAC address that UE can use in subsequent requests.
  3. The UE sends a request with APN, other PDN signalling parameters (e.g. initial attach) to the TWAN to setup a PDN/NSWO connection. The signalling may be transported using ICMP Echo Payload (alternative 1) or 802.11 GAS (alternative 2).
  4. The TWAN assigns a distinct IPv4 gateway address corresponding to the APN/NSWO and responds with this address in server-identity and router address for IPv4. For IPv6, the TWAN assigns a distinct IPv6 gateway address (source address in Router Advertisement) and transient multicast address for router solicitation if needed.
> Editor's Note: The choice of a control protocol transport in steps 3-4 is
> FFS.
Steps 5 -- 9 are performed as specified in TS 23.402, subclause 16.2.1, steps
3 -- 7 for PDN connection establishment for GTP S2a.\ For NSWO connection,
step 5b, the TWAG assigns local connection resources (gateway IP address,
subnet, etc.) for the connection.
  1. The UE sends a layer 3 attach request.\ For IPv4, the UE sends a DHCP Request with server-identity option set to the distinct gateway IP address obtained in step 4.\ For IPv6, the UE may optionally send a Router Solicitation with destination address set to the transient multicast address obtained in step 4.
  2. The TWAN responds to the layer 3 attach.\ For IPv4, the TWAG sends a DHCP Ack with server-identity, router option set to the distinct gateway IP address for the APN/NSWO. The IP address in the message is in yiaddr.\ For IPv6, the TWAG sends a Router Advertisement when a Create Session Response (step 8) is received for this PDN connection or it receives Router Solicitation in step 10. The Router Advertisement is sent with source address set to the distinct gateway IP address configured for this APN/NSWO in step 4.\ The UE can determine the L2 address of the router interface by sending an ARP Request (IPv4) or Neighbor Solicitation (IPv6)
For subsequent PDN / NSWO connections, steps 3 -- 11 are repeated.
Establishing a second connection (IP address/interface) corresponding to an
already signalled/established APN/NSWO session is straightforward using this
method. In step 3 above, the explicit parameters that are conveyed between UE
and TWAG can include the means to indicate if a second connection is being
requested.
Figure 8.2.5.2.2-2: Attach Procedure for PDN and NSWO for PMIP based S2a
The procedure for attach using PMIP based S2a is similar to the sequence for
GTP. However, steps 5a and 8 for PMIP consist of Proxy Binding Update (5a) and
Proxy Binding Ack (8).
##### 8.2.5.2.3 UE Initiated Disconnection Procedure
The disconnection sequence in the figure below supports UE triggered
disconnection of one connection (while the rest of the session remains
unchanged). If the last connection (or all connections) is being released, all
session resources are cleaned up also.
Figure 8.2.5.2.3-1: Disconnection Procedure for PDN and NSWO for GTP based S2a
The procedure to disconnect a PDN /NSWO session for GTP based S2a is shown in
the figure above.
  1. The UE sends a delete connection notification with the IP address and gateway IP address for the connection to trigger disconnection.
  2. If the IP address to be released is not an NSWO connection, the TWAG initiates a Delete Session Request with the IP address of the PDN connection. (2a).\ For NSWO, the TWAN releases local connection resources (2b).
> Steps 3, 4 are as defined in TS 23.402 [3], subclause 16.3.1.1, steps 3, 4.
  1. The PDN GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (cause).
  2. Connection resources in TWAG and UE are released.
Figure 8.2.5.2.3-2: Disconnection Procedure for PDN and NSWO for PMIP based
S2a
The procedure for disconnection using PMIP based S2a is similar to the
sequence for GTP. However, steps 2a and 5 for PMIP consist of Proxy Binding
Update with lifetime set to zero (2a) and Proxy Binding Ack (5).
##### 8.2.5.2.4 HSS/AAA Initiated Disconnection Procedure
The disconnection sequence in the figure below supports disconnection of one
connection triggered by the HSS/AAA (while the rest of the session remains
unchanged). If the last connection (or all connections) is being released, all
session resources are cleaned up also.
Figure 8.2.5.2.4-1: Disconnection Procedure for GTP based S2a
The procedure to disconnect a PDN /NSWO session for GTP based S2a when
triggered by HSS/AAA is shown in the figure above.
  1. The HSS/AAA sends a Session Termination Request message to the TWAN to detach a specific UE.\ In (1b), the TWAG sends a delete connection notification message with the IP address and gateway IP address of the connection to trigger release of connection resources at UE.
  2. The procedures in 8.2.5.2.3, steps 2 -- 6 are followed.
  3. Step 3 defined in TS 23.402 [6], subclause 16.3.1.2 is followed.
Figure 8.2.5.2.4-2: Disconnection Procedure for PMIP based S2a
The procedure for disconnection using PMIP based S2a is similar to the
sequence for GTP. Step 2 in the figure is based on 8.2.5.2.3 for PMIP.
##### 8.2.5.2.5 Handover procedure between 3GPP access and WLAN on GTP S2a
Figure 8.2.5.2.6-1: Handover from 3GPP access to Trusted WLAN on GTP S2a
The handover procedure is based on the Connection Establishment Procedure in
8.2.5.2.2 with the following additions:
  1. The UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on the S5/S8 interface.
  2. The initial TWAN specific L2 procedures are performed. These procedures are TWAN specific and outside the scope of 3GPP.
  3. If the handover establishes the first PDN connection in WLAN of the UE, EAP procedure is performed in this step.
  4. The UE sets up an IP interface to perform initial PDN signalling with the TWAN. During this sequence, if UE and TWAG are Phase 2 compliant, i.e. supporting EPC-routed , handover and multiple PDN connections, the UE sends a request with APN and handover indication, to setup a PDN connection.
  5. The TWAN assigns a distinct IPv4 gateway address corresponding to the APN and responds with this address in server-identity and router address for IPv4. For IPv6, the TWAN assigns a distinct IPv6 gateway address (source address in Router Advertisement) and transient multicast address for router solicitation if needed.
  6. The TWAN sends a Create Session Request (APN, **handover indication**) message to the PDN GW. The APN and handover indication is set in the Create Session Request to allow the PDN GW to re-allocate the same IP address or prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to the 3GPP IP access and to initiate a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF. The APN is used by the PDN GW to determine which PDN connection(s) to handover, in the case that the UE has established multiple PDN connections to different APNs.
Steps 6 -- 11 are performed as Connection Establishment Procedure in
8.2.5.2.2.
  1. The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in TS 23.402 clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [6], clause 5.4.4.1.
#### 8.2.5.3 Impacts on existing nodes or functionality
> Editor\'s Notes: Impacts to UE and network elements within TWAN as well as
> EPC to support backward compatibility and co-existence with Rel-11 in this
> subclause.
This solution minimizes the impact to existing IP configuration procedures --
both DHCP, stateless IPv6 auto-configuration by moving all PDN connection
signalling to a new protocol that only handles PDN connection aspects.
For transporting the new PDN connection signalling, ICMP Echo payload proposed
here has low impact in terms of implementation on the UE and TWAG. The ICMP
messages are echoed back to be compliant with RFC 792 and this adds a response
(echo) by definition. Echoing the message takes additional network capacity
for the echo message, but does not require significant processing in the
TWAN/UE. Two such echoes are needed for each PDN connection setup. A full
implementation of L3 control protocol would be more flexible and complete if
the time and effort to develop it is acceptable -- including its support on UE
and TWAG.
If GAS frames are the chosen method to transport PDN connection signalling, it
requires UEs that support WFA/HS2.0 and standards extensions in WFA/HS2.0.
This method also requires APs to map the PDN signalling over GAS to backhaul
protocol (e.g. RADIUS).
Editor's Note: The implications of using RADIUS to transport the control
protocol between AP -- TWAN is FFS.

### 8.2.6 Solution 6: X
This solution has been merged with the solution in section 8.2.1
###
### 8.2.7 Solution 7: PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)
#### 8.2.7.1 Functional Description
> Editor\'s Notes: It should be described whether and how the solution fulfils
> the requirements in Subclause 8.1.
##### 8.2.7.1.1 Overview
The solution described in this section does not require any new protocols. It
is based on the well-known PPP and PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) protocols,
specified in RFC1661 and RFC2516, respectively. These protocols are used to
implement both the control plane and the user plane.
In summary, the solution is characterized by the following:
  1. A PDN Connection over a trusted WLAN (TWAN) is created by establishing a PPPoE/PPP session between the UE and TWAG (Trusted WLAN Access Gateway).
  2. The PPPoE protocol is used to create a virtual point-to-point link between the UE and TWAG.
  3. The UE encapsulates all traffic pertaining to a PDN connection into PPPoE frames (as shown below). These frames include a PPPoE session ID, which differentiates traffic between different PDN connections.
{width="4.85in" height="0.4951388888888889in"}
  1. The TWAG binds a PPPoE session ID with a PDN connection. Traffic arrived from a certain PPPoE session ID is forwarded to the linked PDN connection and vice versa.
  2. The TWAG behaves as an Access Concentrator that terminates both PPP and PPPoE protocols. It is very similar to a Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) function used in fixed broadband networks.
  3. The UE needs to implement the PPP and PPPoE protocols. Both of them are already available in most smartphone platforms. Note that there are already applications available which enable the user to establish PPPoE connections on a smartphone.
  4. A Non-Seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) connection does not use PPP or PPPoE. So, NSWO traffic is transmitted directly over WLAN without any PPPoE encapsulation (as shown below).

  1. Since NSWO traffic does not use PPPoE, it does not necessarily need to be routed through TWAG. Instead, it can be optimally routed without going through TWAG. This allows TWAG to be offloaded from NSWO traffic. It also allows the WLAN network and the UE to support NSWO traffic with the currently deployed means (i.e. without any changes). However, the solution allows the AP to tunnel NSWO traffic to TWAG, if this is required.
  2. There is no impact on the WLAN AP and on other legacy WLAN components. If the AP supports QoS on the WLAN air interface, it is assumed that the AP can still map between DSCP and WLAN QoS parameters.
The solution requires the following protocol extensions:
  1. The EAP-AKA protocol is enhanced (as proposed by other solutions too) so that during initial connection to TWAN, the UE becomes aware of the supported capabilities, e.g. whether NSWO is supported, whether single or multiple concurrent PDN connections are supported, etc. This can be easily supported by defining new 3GPP-specific EAP-AKA attributes as already done for other attributes (see e.g. AT_TRUST_IND, AT_IPMS_IND, AT_IPMS_RES).
  2. The PPP or PPPoE protocol should be enhanced in order to enable the UE and TWAG to negotiate PDN connectivity parameters (such as APN, attach type) when a new PPPoE/PPP session is created. Such enhancements can be supported by either of the following two options:
a. Option 1: PDN connectivity parameters are negotiated during PPP session
establishment. A new configuration option is specified for PPP, e.g. LCP (Link
Control Protocol) or for IPCP and for IPV6CP (IP Configuration Protocol)
protocols. This configuration option is used to negotiate specific PDN
connectivity parameters (such as APN, attach type, etc.) between the UE and
TWAG when a new PPP session is created. For this purpose the PPP Vendor
Extensions as specified in RFC2153 could be used.
b. Option 2: PDN connectivity parameters are negotiated during PPPoE session
establishment. The Service-Name Tag within PPPoE could be used to transfer APN
information and Vendor-Specific tag could be specified for other parameters.
This way the UE can also indicate the requested PDN type (IPv4/IPv6/IPv4v6).
The details for the above two options are further discussed in clause
8.2.7.2.1. The choice between these two options could be made during the
normative work.The figure below illustrates the user-plane operation for a UE
that concurrently has a NSWO connection and two PDN connections. Note that
traffic for PDN connections is encapsulated in PPPoE frames while NSWO traffic
does not require such encapsulation. Note also that each PPPoE frame carries a
Session ID which is associated with a PDN connection.
There is no requirement for NSWO traffic (i.e. traffic which does not traverse
EPC) to be routed to TWAG. This enables TWAG offload and a single TWAG could
support a larger number of UEs.

#### 8.2.7.2 Procedures
##### 8.2.7.2.1 PDN Connectivity Parameter Negotiation
###### 8.2.7.2.1.1 Option 1: PDN connectivity parameters negotiated during PPP
session establishment
The figure below shows how a PDN connection can be established when the PDN
connectivity parameters are negotiated with the PPP protocol.
{width="5.868055555555555in" height="3.5819444444444444in"}
**Figure 8.2.7.2.1.1-1: PDN connection establishment with Option 1.**
NOTE 1: Although the figure above shows new configuration options for the IPCP
and IPV6CP protocols, those new configuration options could be specified for
the LCP protocol instead.
For establishing a PDN connection with type IPv4, the UE uses the IP Control
Protocol (IPCP), as specified in RFC 1332, "The PPP Internet Protocol Control
Protocol". With IPCP, the UE receives IPv4 configuration parameters, such as
an IPv4 address, DNS servers, etc.
For establishing a PDN connection with type IPv6, the UE uses the IPv6 Control
Protocol (IPV6CP), as specified in RFC 5072, "IPv6 over PPP". With IPV6CP, the
UE negotiates an "Interface-Identifier" (a 64-bit interface identifier) to be
used for address autoconfiguration. On the established PPP session the UE
receives a Router Advertisement and, based on its content, the UE uses either
stateless or stateful autoconfiguration. Since the Router Advertisement is
sent to UE over a point-to-point link, it is possible to use stateless
autoconfiguration in a similar manner as used over 3GPP RAN, i.e. the UE can
receive the /64 IPv6 prefix in the RA message. Moreover it is also possible to
use stateful autoconfiguration for some UEs (although this is not typically
needed).
To support PDN connections with type IPv4v6, the UE can establish two PPP
connections over the same PPPoE session: one for IPv4 (using IPCP) and another
for IPv6 (using IPV6CP). Traffic on both PPP connections is transported on the
same PPPoE session and is thus mapped to the same PDN connection.
Editor's Note: It is FFS if the UE needs to explicitly indicate the requested
PDN type within the new configuration options.
###### 8.2.7.2.1.2 Option 2: PDN connectivity parameters negotiated during
PPPoE session establishment
The figure below shows how a PDN connection can be established when the PDN
connectivity parameters are negotiated with the PPPoE protocol.
{width="2.535416666666667in" height="4.16875in"}
**Figure 8.2.7.2.1.2-1: PDN connection establishment with Option 2.**
In the PPPoE Discovery Request message the UE includes in the existing
_Service-Name_ tag (see RFC2516) the requested APN. Also, in a _Vendor-
Specific_ tag (the details of which should be specified by 3GPP) the UE
includes the Attach-Type and the requested PDN-Type. After the PPPoE session
is established, the TWAG may start the GTP/PMIP tunnel over S2a establishment,
which can result in faster PDN connection creation.
After the PPPoE session is established the UE requests configuration data with
the IPCP and/or IPV6CP (see RFC5072) prototocol. If the negotiated PDN Type is
IPv4v6, the UE establishes two PPP sessions, one with IPCP and another with
IPV6CP. The allocation of IPv6 prefix and address can happen in the same way
as in option 1.
The main advantages of the Option 2 are the following:
  * No modifications to existing IPCP and IPV6CP are needed
  * Avoids potential protocol ambiguities when providing both IPv4 and IPv6 on the same APN. IPV6CP for IPv6 is different to IPCP for IPv4. The PDN type is indicated within the PPPoE message.
  * The network can learn sooner which APN the UE intend to use and thus the network can start creating the GTP/PMIP tunnel over S2a interface earlier (during PPoE discovery), which can result in faster PDN connection creation.
##### 8.2.7.2.2 Initial Attach and UE-initiated Connectivity to PDN
The signaling flow below shows the steps carried out when a UE connects to a
trusted WLAN (TWAN) and establishes a NSWO connection along with a PDN
connection. The figure is generic and applies to both GTP S2a and PMIP S2a.
{width="7.102083333333334in" height="6.113194444444445in"}
Figure 8.2.7.2.2-2: Simplified UE architecture with a non-seamless WLAN
offload (NSWO) connection and a concurrent PDN connection.
NOTE 1: The above figure assumes that Option 1 is used for PDN Connectivity
parameter negotiation (see clause 8.2.7.2.1). However, Option 2 is equally
applicable.
During the EAP-AKA authentication the UE becomes aware of the services offered
by the trusted WLAN network, e.g. whether NSWO is supported, whether a single
and/or multiple concurrent PDN connections are supported, etc. This can be
accomplished by defining 3GPP-specific EAP-AKA attributes.
When the UE decides to activate a PDN connection (with type IPv4) over the
TWAN, it uses the normal PPPoE procedures to discover the TWAG and to
establish a new PPPoE session with the TWAG. A new session ID is allocated by
TWAG to this PPPoE session (for example: Session ID=0x065d, as shown in the
figure).
Subsequently, the UE initiates the establishment of a PPP session according to
the normal PPP procedures. Note that after the LCP negotiation:
  * The standard PPP authentication could be used if the requested PDN connection is needed for "Non-Transparent access to an Intranet or ISP" (see TS 29.061); or
  * The standard PPP authentication could be skipped, if the requested PDN connection is needed for "Transparent access to the Internet" (see TS 29.061). In this case, even when the UE sends a PPP authentication request the TWAG may always accept it.
In the figure above, it is assumed that during the IPCP configuration a new
IPCP configuration option is used. This allows the UE to request a specific
APN, attach type, etc. and allows the TWAG to respond with an offered APN and
possibly other parameters. Although the figure above shows new configuration
options for the IPCP protocol, those new configuration options could be
specified for the LCP protocol instead. PPP Vendor Extensions should be
specified by 3GPP to support these new configuration options.
Note that the signaling flow shown in the figure above is based on known steps
already used in practice. The only extension required is (a) the new EAP-AKA
attribute(s) and (b) the new PPP configuration option(s) that allows the
negotiation of PDN connectivity parameters between the UE and TWAG.
##### 8.2.7.2.3 PDN Connection Release
The figure below illustrates the control-plane signaling flow when the UE
initiates a PDN connection release. The UE simply terminates the corresponding
PPP session and subsequently terminates the associated PPPoE session too.
> {width="6.86875in" height="3.01875in"}
Figure 8.2.7.2.3-1: PDN connection release initiated by UE.
The figure below illustrates the control-plane signaling flow when the P-GW
intiates a PDN connection release. Note that the TWAN could also initiate the
PDN connection release. In this case, the TWAN terminates the PPP session with
the UE and sends the Delete Session Request to P-GW.
The TWAG may use the standard LCP Echo Request/Reply procedure (or other link
management facilites provided by PPPoE) to determine when a UE becomes
unreachable. In this case, the TWAG may detach the UE from EPC by releasing
all its PDN connections.

Figure 8.2.7.2.3-2: PDN connection release initiated by P-GW.
##### 8.2.7.2.4 Handover from 3GPP access to WLAN
The UE can handover a first PDN connection from 3GPP access to WLAN by re-
using the "Initial Attach and UE-Initiated Connectivity to PDN" procedure
described above. In the handover scenario, during the PPP session
establishment the UE provides the associated APN and indicates "Attach Type =
Handover". Existing procedures can then be used (e.g. procedures specified in
TS 23.402 for IP address preservation) to make sure that the PDN connection
over the trusted WLAN uses the same PGW and the same IP address. If the UE
wants to handover additional PDN connections from 3GPP access to WLAN, it
should establish additional PPP connections over WLAN by providing the
associated APNs and "Attach Type = Handover".
#### 8.2.7.3 Impacts on existing nodes or functionality
> Editor\'s Notes: Impacts to UE and network elements within TWAN as well as
> EPC to support backward compatibility and co-existence with Rel-11 in this
> subclause.
#### 8.2.7.4 Evaluation
The solution supports the following capabilities:
  1. Supports one or more concurrent PDN connections. Each PDN connection requires a PPP/PPPoE protocol instance in the UE and in the TWAG.
  2. Supports NSWO traffic and concurrently EPC traffic (via one or more PDN connections).
  3. Supports IPv4, IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDN connections.
  4. Supports IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration. It does not mandate stateful DHCPv6, thus simplifies UE implementation.
  5. Supports PDN connection handover from 3GPP to TWAN with IP address preservation.
  6. Supports TWAG discovery by means of standard PPPoE procedures.
  7. Supports PDN connections for "Non-Transparent access to an Intranet or ISP" and for "Transparent access to the Internet" (see TS 29.061). Standard PPP authentication can be used to authenticate PDN connections for "Non-Transparent access to an Intranet or ISP".
  8. Supports SaMOG phase-2 capable UEs and "legacy" (pre-Rel-12) UEs on the same TWAN (and on the same SSID).
The solution is also characterized by the following features:
  1. NSWO traffic does not need to go through TWAG. This enables TWAG offload and can lead to deployments with reduced cost.
  2. NSWO traffic is transmitted without any encapsulation. This improves air-interface utilization and reduces complexity.
  3. There is no need for special signaling to establish tunnels / point-to-point connections for NSWO traffic. This improves efficiency and reduces complexity.
  4. It is based on the well-known PPP/PPPoE protocols. Thus avoids the effort to standardize and implement new protocols in the UE and in the network. In addition, it minimizes the need for new conformance specifications; only conformance testing against the new PPP configuration options and EAP-AKA attributes is required.
  5. The PPP/PPPoE protocols are already supported by many smartphones (typically as build-in or loadable kernel modules). Thus, UE modifications are minimized.
  6. Standard PPP/PPPoE procedures can be used to monitor the link between the UE and TWAG. For example, the TWAG may use the standard LCP Echo Request/Reply procedure to determine when a UE becomes unreachable and then trigger Detach procedures.
  7. The standard PPP LCP protocol can be used to negotiate an MTU for each PDN connection.
  8. The standard PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) can be used to enable data compression between the UE and TWAG. Although CCP is not considered necessary over WLAN, it is a readily available option for deployment.
  9. The PDN connection establishment can be expedited when Option 2 (as per clause 8.2.7.2.1) is applied.
  10. It is supported by existing WLAN APs. PPPoE frames can traverse existing WLAN APs without any modification. When the AP supports QoS on the WLAN air interface, it is expected that the AP can still map between DSCP and WLAN QoS parameters.
The solution requires the following protocol extensions:
  1. The EAP-AKA protocol should be enhanced so that during initial connection to TWAN, the UE becomes aware of the supported capabilities, e.g. whether NSWO is supported, whether single or multiple concurrent PDN connections are supported, etc. This can be easily supported by defining new 3GPP-specific EAP-AKA attributes as already done for other attributes (see e.g. AT_TRUST_IND, AT_IPMS_IND, AT_IPMS_RES).
  2. The PPP or PPPoE protocol should be enhanced in order to enable the UE and TWAG to negotiate PDN connectivity parameters (such as APN, attach type) when a new PPPoE or PPP session is created. Such enhancements can be supported by either of the following two options presented in clause 8.2.7.2.1.
### 8.2.8 Solution 8: Solution using new 3GPP specific LLC/SNAP header
settings
#### 8.2.8.1 Functional Description
##### 8.2.8.1.1 General
This solution addresses the user plane problem of supporting multiple PDN
connections between the UE and the TWAG.
The solution has the following aspects:
a) Works both for the case where an AP only supports 802.11 â†” Ethernet II
bridging or where it supports 802.3 â†” 802.11 bridging.
b) The LLC Address field on the wireless link (and optionally on the 802.3
LAN, if 802.3 is used) is always set to indicate that a SNAP header is
present.
c) The OUI (Organisationally Unique Identifier) of the SNAP header on the
wireless link (and optionally on the 802.3 LAN, if 802.3 is used) is set to
the value used in RFC 1042 (00 00 00).
d) 3GPP requests _x_ (tbd) new EtherType values from the IEEE Registration
Authority (note that: a request to IEEE RA for 12 EtherType values would be
sufficient for supporting up to the maximum of 11 PDN connections per UE with
one spare for support of a 3GPP control plane protocol if needed). These
EtherTypes will be sufficient in number to provide differentiation between PDN
connections as well as differentiation of any 3GPP control plane protocol that
needs to be supported.
e) These new EtherType values are directly mapped onto the SNAP Protocol Type
field on the 802.11 network. On an Ethernet II network these new EtherType
values are used to populate the EtherType field (and there is a one to one
mapping between 802.11 Protocol Type and Ethernet II EtherType). On an 802.3
fixed network the EtherType values are used to populate the Protocol Type
field (and there is a one to one mapping between SNAP Protocol Type on 802.11
and SNAP Protocol Type on 802.3 in the bridging function).
f) In the uplink, the combination of source (device) MAC address and EtherType
value can be used by the TWAG to bind the traffic to the appropriate GTP
tunnel. In the downlink the TWAG binds the GTP tunnel to the appropriate
Ethernet II 'link' by appropriate setting of the destination (device) MAC
address and EtherType value.
g) The allocation of a particular EtherType/Protocol Type value to a
particular user plane PDN connection can be established dynamically via
signalling.
h) Since conventionally EtherType is used to indicate the higher layer >
protocol type that is associated with the payload, a method is > needed by
which the UE or TWAG can differentiate between IPv4 and > IPv6 in the case of
a dual stack PDN connection. This issue is > solved at the IP layer since the
UE or TWAG can inspect the first > 4 bits of the payload to determine the IP
type of the packet. In > both IPv4 and IPv6 the first 4 bits of the payload
convey > 'version' of the IP packet. In IPv4 'version' takes the value '4' >
and in IPv6 it takes the value '6'. Note that an assumption here > is that the
only types of packet which need to be carried on the > PDN connection are
packets of type IPv4 and IPv6.

interface**
#### 8.2.8.2 Procedures
An LLC/SNAP user plane solution can be used in conjunction with a variety of
the signaling solutions which are described as part of other solutions in this
TR. These signaling possibilities are now discussed and any modifications to
those proposals which are required in order to support the LLC/SNAP based user
plane solution are described.
It is worth noting that some of the signaling options presented within other
solutions make use of new signaling protocols which would be defined by 3GPP.
The LLC/SNAP solution can provide support for such protocols. This is achieved
simply by reserving one of the 3GPP specific EtherType values for this
purpose. For example an EtherType value _p_ could correspond to a 3GPP
specified control plane protocol that runs between the UE and the TWAG. If
either the UE or the TWAG receives a frame with an EtherType value set to _p_
then it would process the frame contents as a 3GPP control plane frame. Note
that this reserved value _p_ would be defined in a 3GPP specification and
would not be dynamically changeable.
Non Seamless Wireless Offload (NSWO) could be supported by the device in the
way that the device would typically use today when directly accessing the
internet over WLAN (eg SNAP OUI set to 00 00 00 (RFC 1042) and SNAP Protocol
Type set to the EtherType value corresponding to the appropriate higher layer
protocol (IP=0x0800, ARP=0x0806), and with IP address locally allocated by the
TWAN).
From a signaling point of view the UE needs to learn both the MAC address of
the TWAG and the EtherType value that it should use for a given PDN
connection. Regards the former issue, an approach which will be common to many
if not all of the signaling solutions will be for the UE to determine the MAC
address of the TWAG through DHCP/ARP messaging using a broadcast 802.11 MAC
address. The TWAG also needs to learn the MAC address of the device and the
EtherType values that should be bound with given GTP tunnels.
Note: Because with this proposal EtherType is encapsulated in a Protocol Type
field on an 802.3 LAN or on an 802.11 WLAN, and since EtherType is always used
on Ethernet II, in the remainder of this section we will in general just use
the term 'EtherType' as opposed to 'Protocol Type'.

The DHCP | | | | signaling from TWAG | | | | to the UE which | | | | carries the | | | | allocated IP address | | | | also makes use of | | | | this APN and DHCP | | | | specific EtherType | | | | header value when | | | | building the Layer 2 | | | | frame, so that the | | | | UE can associate the | | | | allocated IP address | | | | with the correct PDN | | | | connection. | | | | | | | | Similarly, PDN | | | | disconnection makes | | | | use of the same | | | | EtherType values at | | | | Layer 2 for | | | | conveying the DHCP | | | | signaling to release | | | | the IP address. | | | | | | | | If this signaling | | | | approach were to be | | | | adopted and if up to | | | | 11 APN's per device | | | | are to be supported | | | | then 3GPP would need | | | | to request 22 | | | | EtherType values | | | | from the IEEE RA. | | | | | | | | - UE learns TWAG | | | | MAC address: | | | | DHCP/ARP on | | | | broadcast MAC | | | | addr | | | | | | | | - UE learns | | | | EtherType/PDN | | | | connection | | | | binding: EAP-AKA | | | | / ANQP | | | | | | | | - TWAG learns | | | | device MAC | | | | address: During | | | | second DHCP | | | | execution step | | | | | | | | - TWAG learns | | | | GTP/EtherType | | | | binding: TWAG | | | | configures it | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Solution 3: Stateful | Yes | The DHCP messaging | | DHCP based solution | | is modified so that | | | | instead of the UE / | | | | TWAG indicating GRE | | | | keys the UE /TWAG | | | | indicates the | | | | EtherType value that | | | | will be used by | | | | certain PDN | | | | connections. | | | | | | | | - UE learns TWAG | | | | MAC address: | | | | DHCP/ARP on | | | | broadcast MAC | | | | addr | | | | | | | | - UE learns | | | | EtherType/PDN | | | | connection | | | | binding: | | | | modifications to | | | | DHCP | | | | | | | | - TWAG learns | | | | device MAC | | | | address: DHCP | | | | procedure | | | | | | | | - TWAG learns | | | | GTP/EtherType | | | | binding: TWAG | | | | configures it | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Solution 4 | N/A | No signalling | | | | solution provided. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Solution 5: | Partially (some | Solution 8 (SNAP/LLC | | Associating APN/PDN | aspects of the | based user plane) | | with virtual IP | solution may be used | does support the use | | interface | in conjunction with | of a new 3GPP | | | SNAP/LLC based | defined 'PDN Control | | | approach) | protocol' as is | | | | defined as part of | | | | this solution. | | | | However, the methods | | | | described in | | | | Solution 5 for | | | | transporting the | | | | 'PDN Control | | | | Protocol', eg use of | | | | ICMP Echo payload or | | | | 802.11 GAS frame are | | | | competing methods to | | | | the approach | | | | proposed in Solution | | | | 8 (which instead | | | | would support such a | | | | 'PDN Control | | | | protocol' through | | | | the use of a | | | | specific EtherType | | | | value). | | | | | | | | (See for example | | | | comments under | | | | solution 1) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Solution 6: X | Yes | This approach | | | | proposes the use of | | | | a new 3GPP specified | | | | TSM (TWAN Session | | | | Management) control | | | | plane protocol to | | | | run between the UE | | | | and the TWAG. | | | | Solution 8 provides | | | | support for a new | | | | control plane | | | | protocol as | | | | discussed above. | | | | | | | | Instead of | | | | delineating PDN | | | | connections through | | | | VLAN ID or TWAG MAC | | | | address, if this | | | | signaling solution | | | | were to be combined | | | | with Solution 8 then | | | | Ethertype would be | | | | used to distinguish | | | | between PDN | | | | connections.

### 8.2.9 Solution 9: EAP based signaling solution
#### 8.2.9.1 Functional Description
> Editor\'s Notes: It should be described whether and how the solution fulfils
> the requirements in Subclause 8.1.
##### 8.2.9.1.1 General
In this solution all 3GPP specification signaling between the UE and the
network is carried within EAP signaling. This solution is based on defining a
new attribute for EAP to transfer 3GPP specific information (e.g. APN,
handover indication) between the UE and the network. This type of new
attribute for EAP is also needed if EAP is used to create the first PDN
connection at initial attach, but other mechanisms are used for creating
additional PDN connections as it is described e.g. in solution 1 (section
8.2.1). The solution works in the following way.
1) How the UE triggers the creation of the new PDN Connections:
The assumption is that the UE has already been authenticated to the TWAN. When
a new PDN Connection needs to be created the UE sends an IEEE 802.1X EAPoL
Start message to the authenticator. The authenticator responds, as it must,
with EAP-Request/Identity. The UE responds to this as expected for a re-
authentication. The UE indicates the APN and other 3GPP specific parameters
within the EAP-Response/AKA'-Reauthentication and EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge
messages in a new EAP attribute.
2) How the EAP-Server indicates the support for the functionality described in
this solution:
The network can indicate the support for the functionality described in this
solution within EAP-Request/AKA'-Reauthentication and EAP-
Request/AKA'-Challenge messages in a new EAP attribute.
3) How the network indicates to the UE that the creation of the new PDN
Connection failed:
A new AT_NOTIFICATION notification code has to be defined. This code is sent
by the EAP-server in EAP-Request/AKA'-Notification to the UE. The general rule
is that both S and P bits must be set to 0, i.e. indicating an error after a
successful authentication, because the APN & PDN specific authorization
failed.
4) How the network indicates to the UE that the creation of the PDN succeeded:
A network specific information prior to or during the PDN Connection
establishment is sent to the UE using a success-indicating EAP-
Request/AKA'-Notification (such as VLAN tags, selected APN).
5) How the UE or the network initiates a deletion of the PDN Connection.
A UE can also trigger the release of a PDN connection using the (fast) re-
authentication mechanism. The UE acts like in case 1) but sends different
values within the messages to the network. The network initiated PDN
Connection release is done by the network requesting a (fast) re-
authentication. The indication that the PDN connection is released is included
in the EAP-Response/AKA' Reauthentication or EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge
messages.
The mechanism proposed does not depend on the selected user plane mechanism
selected for SaMOG phase 2 as transporting EAP messages is possible in all
anticipated solutions.
As the capability indication from the network side is possible, the
implementation of supporting additional PDN connection establishment in the
network can also be optional. As there might be deployments where the
additional PDN connection support is not needed, it is proposed to make this
feature optional in the specification, however the proposed solution can also
be specified in a way that the support of additional PDN creation in the
network is mandatory.
##### 8.2.9.1.2 Protocol stack
The authentication procedure used in this solution follows the Authentication
and key agreement procedures specified in section 6 of TS 33.402 [28]. Beyond
the proposed additional parameters no other change is needed.
Figure 8.2.9.1.2-1 shows the protocol stack that can be used together for
authentication, capability negotiation and signaling for PDN connection
management.
Figure 8.2.9.1.2-1: Protocol stack for authentication related signalling
3GPP access authentication based on EAP-AKA' as defined in IEEE RFC 5448 [27]
(together with still necessary, 3GPP defined extensions) is performed end-to-
end between UE and 3GPP AAA Server. Between UE and the TWAN/authenticator the
information is transported over EAPoL (see IEEE 802.1X [5]). Between
TWAN/authenticator and 3GPP AAA Server the EAP-AKA' payload is transported
within Diameter messages. The following information is assumed to be exchanged
newly, i.e. in addition to Rel. 11:
  * handover indication (from UE to NW);
  * APN (requested one from UE to NW, selected one from NW to UE):
  * success/failure of PDN connection request (from NW to UE):
  * PDN connection identifier (from NW to UE at PDN connection establishment or teardown. from UE to NW at PDN connection teardown)
  * User plane connection identifier (e.g. VLAN tag)
However the solution is not limited in transferring the above listed
parameters, other parameters could also be sent.
Some examples how EAP procedures can be used for sending session management
information between the UE and TWAN are presented. The principle is that the
TWAN can read the parameters sent by the UE from EAP messages, but cannot
modify them. This is possible as during EAP-AKA' the EAP messages are
integrity protected, but not encrypted. When the TWAN needs to send a
parameter to the UE, it inserts it in the Diameter message sent to the 3GPP
AAA server and then the 3GPP AAA server moves the received parameter from the
Diameter message to the consecutive EAP message.
##### 8.2.9.1.3 Signaling information from UE to the network
In Figure 8.2.9.1.3-1 an example is presented how the UE can send the
requested APN to the TWAN during a fast re-authentication when a new PDN
connection is established and how the network can send back the selected APN
to the UE. Other session management parameters (e.g. handover indication, VLAN
tags) can be sent in a similar manner
Figure 8.2.9.1.3-1: Sending the requested APN to the TWAN
  * Step 0. The UE triggers a new EAP authentication.
.Editor's Note: It is FFS how the UE can trigger a new authentication,
especially if IEEE 802.1X EAPoL Start message can trigger a new EAP
authentication.
  * Step 1-3: These steps are performed as in 3GPP TS 33 402 [28].
  * Step 4: The UE adds the requested APN (and other session management parameters) into the EAP message into a new EAP information element. The TWAN reads the requested APN from the EAP message and adds the selected APN (and other session management parameters including the indication of success or failure of the PDN connection establishment) as a Diameter information element to the Diameter message sent to the 3GPP AAA server. Note that the requested APN is not removed from the EAP message as the TWAN cannot modify the EAP message.
  * Step 5: The 3GPP AAA server extracts the selected APN from the Diameter message and inserts it into the EAP message in a new information element. Note that the 3GPP AAA server ignores the requested APN received in the EAP message and does not interpret the selected APN received in Diameter, it just copies the Selected APN value from the received Diameter message into the EAP message to be sent. The UE receives the selected APN (and other session management parameters) within the EAP message.
  * Step 6-7: these steps are performed as in 3GPP TS 33 402 [28].
##### 8.2.9.1.4 Signaling information from the network to the UE
In Figure 8.2.9.1.4-1 an example is presented how the network can send an
indication to the UE that a PDN connection is released during a fast re-
authentication. Other parameters (e.g. handover indication) can be sent in a
similar manner.
Figure 8.2.9.1.4-1: Sending the PDN connection release to the UE
  * Step 1-2a: These steps are performed as in 3GPP TS 33 402 [28].
  * Step 2b-2c: The TWAN adds the indication of the PDN connection release into the Diameter message within a Diameter information element. This indication shall contain an identifier of the release PDN connection to be released.
  * Step 3a: The 3GPP AAA server extracts the Release Indication from the Diameter message and inserts it into the EAP message in a new information element. Note that the 3GPP AAA server does not interpret the Release Indication, it just copies it from the received Diameter message into the EAP message.
  * Step 3b-3c: The UE receives the Release Indication within the EAP message.
  * Step 4-8: These steps are performed as in 3GPP TS 33 402 [28]. After the successful EAP procedure the UE shall consider the PDN connection released.
In the procedures described below the principles presented in this section are
used to carry session management information within EAP signaling, but for the
sake of simplicity the details are not presented within the procedures.
#### 8.2.9.2 Procedures
> Editor\'s Notes: The call flows are described in this subclause.
##### 8.2.9.2.1 Initial Attach in WLAN on S2a
The initial attach procedure is the same as (or similar to) the initial attach
procedure described in section 8.2.1.2 with the following addition:
In step 2 of Figure 8.2.1.2.1.1-1 during the EAP authentication within the
capability indication the TWAN shall also indicate if it supports the creation
of additional PDN connections or a simultaneous NSWO connection. This
additional capability indication is only needed if the support of additional
PDN connections or simultaneous NSWO connection creation is optional.
##### 8.2.9.2.2 UE-Initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN in WLAN on S2a
###### 8.2.9.2.2.1 UE-Initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN in WLAN on GTP
S2a
This procedure is used to create additional PDN connections or when the UE is
authenticated to the network (via EAP-AKA') and has a NSWO session.
Figure 8.2.9.2.2.1-1: UE-Initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN in WLAN on
GTP S2a
The procedure is as in section 8.2.1.2.1.1 (Initial Attach in WLAN on GTP S2a
for solution 1) with the following additions:
  * Step 0: The precondition of this procedure is that the UE has valid authentication with the TWAN. The UE might have an existing PDN connection or might use NSWO capability of the TWAN.
  * Step 1. The UE triggers a new EAP authentication by sending an IEEE 802.1X EAPoL Start message to the authenticator.
  * Step 2. An EAP authentication using Fast Reauthentication is performed if possible, otherwise a full authentication is performed. The UE indicates the APN and other 3GPP specific parameters within the EAP-Response/AKA'-Reauthentication and EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge messages in a new EAP attribute in a similar way as it is indicated during initial attach.
  * Step 8: After the successful PDN connection establishment the EAP procedure is completed. Within this step the TWAN sends back information about the established PDN connection (e.g. success indication, necessary user plane parameters, such as VLAN tag).
  * During the procedure a new virtual point-to-point between the UE and the TWAG is created for the new PDN connection (on NSWO session). When and how this is performed depends on the mechanism used for point-to-point link creation.
###### 8.2.9.2.2.2 UE-Initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN in WLAN on PMIP
S2a
The required additions to the procedure are the same as the ones described for
GTP S2a (see previous section) as the proposed additions to the EAP procedures
do not depend on the protocol used over S2a.
##### 8.2.9.2.3 Handover procedure between 3GPP access and WLAN on S2a
###### 8.2.9.2.3.1 Handover from 3GPP access to WLAN on GTP S2a
This procedure is used to hand over a PDN connection from 3GPP access to WLAN
on GTP S2a. If multiple PDN connections are handed over then this procedure is
invoked for each PDN connections separately.
Figure 8.2.9.2.3.1-1: Handover from 3GPP access to WLAN on GTP S2a
During the steps of Figure 8.2.9.2.3.1-1 the following should be taken into
account:
  * Step 0: The UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on the S5/S8 interface.
  * Step 1: If the UE has no valid authentication with the TWAN, i.e. the UE has neither a PDN connection nor a NSWO connection then this step is the same as step 2 of 8.2.1.2.1.1-1. If the UE has a valid authentication with the TWAN either due to the UE having an existing PDN connection or using NSWO capability of the TWAN, then this step is the same as step 2 of 8.2.9.2.2.1-1.
  * Step 2: As step 2 in 8.2.9.2.2.1-1with the following addition: the UE indicates handover via EAP to the 3GPP AAA Server.
  * Step 3: The same as step 3-15 in 8.2.9.2.2.1-1 with the addition that handover is performed: the handover indication is set in the Create Session Request to allow the PDN GW to re-allocate the same IP address or prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to the 3GPP IP access and to initiate a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF.
  * Step 4: The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure in 3GPP access as defined in TS 23.402 subclause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401, subclause 5.4.4.1.
###### 8.2.9.2.3.2 Handover from 3GPP access to WLAN on PMIP S2a
The required additions to the procedure are the same as the ones described for
GTP S2a (see previous section) as the proposed additions to the EAP procedures
do not depend on the protocol used over S2a.
###### 8.2.9.2.3.3 Handover from TWAN to 3GPP access
This procedure can be performed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3]. Solution
specific changes are needed when after the handover the PGW initiates the
removal of the resources in the TWAN. These changes can be found in section
8.2.9.2.4.
##### 8.2.9.2.4 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation
###### 8.2.9.2.4.1 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN
on GTP S2a
This procedure applies when the PDN GW would like to release a PDN connection.
Figure 8.2.9.2.4.1-1: PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in
WLAN on GTP S2a
During the steps of Figure 8.2.9.2.4.1-1 the following should be taken into
account:
  * Step 3: An EAP authentication is triggered by the TWAN. Preferably a Fast Reauthentication is performed, but if it is not possible due to any reason then a full authentication is performed. The TWAN indicates that it requests a release of an existing PDN connection within the EAP-Request/AKA'-Reauthentication and EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge messages in a new EAP attribute.
NOTE: Step 3 and steps 4 and 5 can be performed simultaneously.
###### 8.2.9.2.4.2 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN
on PMIP S2a
The required additions to the procedure are the same as the ones described for
GTP S2a (see previous section) as the proposed additions to the EAP procedures
do not depend on the protocol used over S2a.
##### 8.2.9.2.5 TWAN requested PDN Disconnection Procedures
###### 8.2.9.2.5.1 TWAN requested PDN Disconnection Procedure in WLAN on GTP
S2a
This procedure applies when multiple PDN connections have been established or
when the UE has at least one PDN connection and simultaneously uses NSWO.
Figure 8.2.9.2.5.1-1: TWAN initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN
on GTP S2a
During the steps of Figure 8.2.9.2.3.1-1 the following should be taken into
account:
  * Step 2. An EAP authentication is triggered by the TWAN. Preferably a Fast Reauthentication is performed, but if it is not possible due to any reason then a full authentication is performed. The TWAN indicates that it requests a release of an existing PDN connection within the EAP-Request/AKA'-Reauthentication and EAP-Request/AKA'-Challenge messages in a new EAP attribute.
NOTE: An NSWO session that is simultaneously used with PDN connection(s) can
also be terminated in this way. If the NSWO offload session is terminated then
steps 3-6 are not performed.
###### 8.2.9.2.5.2 TWAN Initiated Detach and requested PDN Disconnection
Procedure in WLAN on PMIP S2a
The required additions to the procedure are the same as the ones described for
GTP S2a (see previous section) as the proposed additions to the EAP procedures
do not depend on the protocol used over S2a.
##### 8.2.9.2.6 UE requested PDN Disconnection Procedures
###### 8.2.9.2.6.1 UE requested PDN Disconnection Procedure in WLAN on GTP S2a
This procedure applies when multiple PDN connections have been established or
when the UE has at least one PDN connection and simultaneously uses NSWO.
Figure 8.2.9.2.6.1-1: UE requested PDN Disconnection Procedure in WLAN on GTP
S2a
During the steps of Figure 8.2.9.2.3.1-1 the following should be taken into
account:
  * Step 1. The UE triggers a new EAP authentication.
.Editor's Note: It is FFS how the UE can trigger a new authentication,
especially if IEEE 802.1X EAPoL Start message can trigger a new EAP
authentication.
  * Step 2. An EAP authentication is performed. Preferably a Fast Reauthentication is performed, but if it is not possible due to any reason then a full authentication is performed. The UE indicates that it requests a release of an existing PDN connection within the EAP-Response/AKA' Reauthentication and EAP-Response/AKA'-Challenge messages in a new EAP attribute.
NOTE: An NSWO session that is simultaneously used with PDN connection(s) can
also be terminated in this way. If the NSWO offload session is terminated then
steps 3-6 are not performed.
  * Step 3-6: Step 3 is triggered by the PDN connection release request indication received in step 2.
###### 8.2.9.2.6.2 UE requested PDN Disconnection Procedure in WLAN on GTP S2a
on PMIP S2a
The required additions to the procedure are the same as the ones described for
GTP S2a (see previous section) as the proposed additions to the EAP procedures
do not depend on the protocol used over S2a.
##### 8.2.9.2.7 Detach Procedures
There is nothing special in the detach procedures, they are in principle the
same as specified in TS 23.402 [3] for Trusted Non-3GPP Access Networks. If
the detach procedure requires to perform PDN connection release procedures
then the procedures described above are applicable.
#### 8.2.9.3 Impacts on existing nodes or functionality
> Editor\'s Notes: Impacts to UE and network elements within TWAN as well as
> EPC to support backward compatibility and co-existence with Rel-11 in this
> subclause.
The UE shall support an enhanced EAP-AKA' scheme with new attributes in EAP
messages.
The 3GPP AAA server shall support:
  * an enhanced EAP-AKA' scheme with new attributes in EAP messages;
  * additional Diameter AVP for parameters sent from TWAN to the UE.
NOTE: The 3GPP AAA server does not process the new parameters, their values
are simply ignored or copied between messages.
#### 8.2.9.4 Evaluation
> Editor\'s Notes: The fulfilment to the requirements in Subclause 8.1 as well
> as simplicity of implementation in the UE should be evaluated.
### 8.2.10 Solution 10 : WCS Solution
#### 8.2.10.1 Functional Description
> Editor\'s Notes: It should be described whether and how the solution fulfils
> the requirements in Subclause 8.1.
##### 8.2.10.1.1 Overview
This solution proposes a control plane protocol between the UE and the TWAG
for mobility management PDN connections.
This solution supports simultaneous NSWO and PDN connections.
For the user plane, a virtual MAC address or VLAN is used to differentiate
multiple connections (including PDN connections and NSWO connection).
UE and network capability is negotiated during EAP-AKA' procedure to decide
whether the Rel-11 or the Rel-12 SaMOG procedure is performed.
##### 8.2.10.1.2 User plane
The point-to-point link required to transport traffic for a given PDN
connection, or for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) is realized via the TWAN
reserving a distinct VLAN ID or virtual MAC address that uniquely (on a per-UE
basis) corresponds to an PDN connection or NSWO.
The link model for VLAN based user plane is described in 8.2.2.1.1.1, and the
link model for virtual MAC based user plane is described in 8.2.2.1.1.2.

##### 8.2.10.1.3 Control plane
A UE-TWAG protocol is used to control (i.e. setup and teardown) the per-PDN
point-to-point link. This protocol is denoted as WCS (WLAN Control Signaling)
and should be defined by 3GPP. The functions that WCS supports include:
Establishment of a per-UE-and-PDN point-to-point link; Tear down of a per-UE-
and-PDN point-to-point link; IP address allocation for PDN connections
connection. An NSWO connection is established using DHCP or IPv6 stateless
autoconfiguration after authentication in the per UE p2p link.
Reliability of the WCS protocol uses RFC 3315 reliability mechanisms and
depends on the reception of a reply message in response to a request message.
If no response is received, re-transmission of the request message can use the
DHCP re-transmission timer value. No support for fragmentation is provided and
is not necessary for the control protocol.
Three alternatives for the transport of WCS are outlined below.
> Editor\'s Notes: One of these alternatives for protocol transport needs to
> be chosen. The selection would depend on the choice of user plane.
###### 8.2.10.1.3.1 Alternative 1: Virtual MAC-based control protocol
transport
The frame format of the control plane is as shown in Figure 8.2.10.1.3-1.
A new Ethertype is used to identify the WCS protocol. If the virtual MAC
address is used by TWAG to differentiate the user plane PDN connections, a
dedicated virtual MAC address may also be used to differentiate the control
plane.
The new Ethertype for WCS needs to be defined in IEEE.
* * *
MAC/LLC WCS Ethertype Payload(WCS)
* * *
Figure 8.2.10.1.3-1 Frame format for PDN for Virtual MAC-based control
protocol
A dedicated p2p Link ID (i.e. (Virtual MAC address) allocated by TWAG is used
for WCS signalling. The Virtual MAC address is unique per UE.
This MAC address is sent to the UE during EAP-AKA' authentication as described
in clause 8.2.10.1.3.4. In this case, the p2p link ID in clause 8.2.10.1.3.4
is a Virtual MAC address of the TWAG.
###### 8.2.10.1.3.2 Alternative 2: VLAN-based control protocol transport
The frame format of the control plane is as shown in Figure 8.2.10.1.3.2-1.
* * *
MAC/LLC VLAN New Ethertype Payload (WCS)
* * *
Figure 8.2.10.1.3.2-1 Frame format for PDN for L2.5-based control protocol
The VLAN ID is used to differentiate the tunnel between the control plane and
the user plane protocol. In the corresponding user plane, the VLAN ID used to
distinguish PDN connections.
As in the case of Alternative 1 (clause 8.2.10.1.3.1), a new Ethertype is
needed to indicate that payload is WCS.
The dedicated p2p link ID (i.e. VLAN ID) used for control plane signalling on
top of per UE p2p link is negotiated during the EAP-AKA' procedure. Details of
provisioning the p2p link ID (i.e. VLAN ID) are described in clause
8.2.10.1.3.4. The TWAG MAC address is also sent to the UE during EAP-AKA'
authentication sequence, along with the VLAN ID.
###### 8.2.10.1.3.3 Alternative 3: L3-based control protocol transport
In this alternative, the frame format of the control plane message is as shown
in Figure 8.2.10.1.3.3-1.
* * *
MAC/LLC UDP/IP Payload (WCS)
* * *
Figure 8.2.10.1.3.3-1 Frame format for L3-based control protocol
The payload contains the WCS control protocol message. The UE gets a link-
local address or NSWO address before using L3 based control protocol. The IP
address of the TWAG is sent to the UE during the EAP-AKA' procedure in the
same as how the TWAG MAC address is delivered in alternative2.
###### 8.2.10.1.3.4 p2p link ID negotiation in EAP-AKA' procedure.
This procedure describes the p2p link ID is negotiation during EAP-AKA'. The
p2p link ID is used to establish tunnel to transport the control plane
protocol (WCS).

######
> **Figure 8.2.10.1.3.4-1 p2p link ID negotiation**
Step4-Step5 TWAG sends the p2p link ID via TWAN to the 3GPP AAA.
Step13a,b-14, the p2p link ID is sent in EAP-REQ message to the UE.
The p2p link ID could be the virtual MAC address or VLAN ID provisioned in the
TWAN.

negotiation
Figure 8.2.10.2.1-1: Initial attachment in WLAN on S2a for roaming and non-
roaming scenarios
> The procedure is as in TS 23.402 clause 16.2 with the following additions:
  * Step 2. As part of this step, the UE shall send an indication to the network as to whether it supports Rel-12 SaMOG. Depending on the capabilities of the network and the indication of the UE, the network informs the UE as part of step 2 whether the Rel-12 SaMOG procedures should be performed.
#####
##### 8.2.10.2.1.2 Initial Attach continuation for GTP based S2a
Figure 8.2.10.2.1-2: Initial attachment in WLAN on S2a for roaming and non-
roaming scenarios
The procedure continues from step 2 in clause 8.2.10.2.1:
\- Step 2, as part of the authentication procedure, the p2p link ID for WCS
signalling is negotiated between the UE and the TWAG. There are following
alternatives to establish the p2p link for WCS:
  * If Alternative 1 (clause 8.2.10.1.3.1) based mechanism is used for WCS, then a (virtual) MAC address of TWAG is send to the UE.
  * If Alternative 2 (clause 8.2.10.1.3.2) based mechanism is used for WCS, then the VLAN ID is negotiated between the UE and the TWAG. Also the MAC address of the TWAG should be sent to the UE.
  * If Alternative 3 (clause 8.2.10.1.3.3) based mechanism is used for WCS, the TWAG IP address is sent to the UE.
\- Step3.1, The UE will get a link local address or NSWO Address from TWAN
using RFC 4861 for IPv6, or RFC 3927 for IPv4.The UE can use this IP address
for the transport of the control plane protocol to TWAG. If the UE wants to
setup an NSWO connection, the UE sends a DHCP Request (and optionally an IPv6
Router Solicitation Request) in this step.
\- Step3.2: If the UE wants to set up a PDN connection, the UE sends a WCS
Attach Request to the TWAN. This message includes AttachType, APN, , PDN type,
PCO. The Attach Type field indicates initial attach and the APN field
indicates the APN that the UE requests. The PDN type field indicates the IP
address type the UE request. The PCO field may indicate that the UE wants
deferred IP address allocation and if so, the UE will send DHCP/RS after the
attach procedures.
There are two options for user plane p2p link ID. 1) virtual MAC address 2)
VLAN ID allocated by the UE
-Step 4-8 refers to step-3 --step7 in clause 16.2.1 of TS 23.402. Additionally, if the PDN GW receives the PCO which indicates deferred IPv4 address allocation, then the PDN GW will not allocate IP address to the UE at this step.
Step 9 the TWAN sends a WCS attach accept message to the UE. If the UE does
not indicate an APN in the attach request, the TWAN should send the selected
APN to the UE. The IP address(es) is also sent to the UE if the PDN GW has
allocated the IP address to the UE (i.e., not deferred address for IPv4). .
This response contains a User Plane p2p link ID to be used in further
signalling associated with this PDN connection.
If the user plane p2p link is VLAN based, the VLAN ID allocated by the TWAN is
included in the p2p link field of the attach accept message. Alternatively, if
the user plane p2p link is virtual MAC based, the virtual MAC allocated by the
TWAN is included in the p2p link field.
If the UE requests a deferred IPv4 address allocation, the UE may request for
an IP address using DHCP after the attach procedure. DHCP signalling is
performed over the established p2p link. In IPv6, prefix assignment takes
place using RFC 4861 over the established p2p link.

Editor's Notes: The procedure is FFS.
##### 8.2.10.2.2 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN
This procedure is used when the UE requests additional PDN connections.
This procedure is also used when the UE requests more PDN connections in the
same APN.
The p2p link is established between UE and TWAG per each PDN connection.
###### 8.2.10.2.2.1 UE-Initiated Connectivity to PDN in WLAN on GTP S2a
Figure 8.2.10.2.2.1-1: UE initiated connectivity to PDN/NSWO
  * Step 1. The UE triggers the establishment of a new per-UE and per-PDN point-to-point link. The UE sends WCS PDN Connectivity Request (APN, PDN Type, Protocol Configuration Options, Request Type). The Request Type indicates \"initial request\" if the UE requests new additional PDN connectivity over the 3GPP access network for multiple PDN connections, the Request Type indicates \"handover\" when the UE is performing a handover from 3GPP access and the UE has already established connectivity with the PDN over the 3GPP access.
  * Step 2-6. Same as step 3-7 in clause 8.2.10.2.2.1. As part of these steps, the TWAN verifies that the APN requested by the UE is allowed by subscription. Upon handover, the TWAN selects the PDN GW handling this PDN connection; otherwise, the TWAN performs PDN GW selection as described in TS 23.402. Steps 2-6 are executed with the selected PDN GW.
  * Step 7. The TWAN replies with WCS PDN connectivity accept to the UE. This response contains a p2p link id to be used in further signalling associated with this PDN connection.
  * If the UE requests deferred IPV4 address allocation, it may negotiate the IPv4 address with DHCPv4 after step7.

This procedure is as in TS 23.402 clause 8.2.1.1/8.2.1.2 with the following
differences:
  * Step 1. There is a GTP or PMIP tunnel between TWAN and PGW.
  * Step 18. The PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in the TWAN as defined in clause 8.2.10.2.9.
##### 8.2.10.2.6 UE/TWAN RequestedPDN disconnection in WLAN on S2a
###### 8.2.10.2.6.1 UE/TWAN requested PDN disconnection in WLAN on GTP S2a
For multiple PDN connections, this disconnection procedure shall be repeated
for each PDN connection that needs to be released.
Figure 8.2.10.2.6.1-1: UE/TWAN-initiated PDN disconnection procedure with GTP
S2a in WLAN
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local
Breakout cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages
between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming and Home Routed Roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps of
interaction between the PDN GW and PCRF do not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may
employ static configured policies.
  * Step 1. If the PDN disconnection is initiated by the UE, the UE sends a WCS PDN Disconnection Request (p2p link ID) to the TWAG. The p2p link ID identifies a PDN connection uniquely. Step 2. The TWAN releases the PDN connection and sends a Delete Session Request (Linked EPS Bearer ID) message for this PDN connection to the PDN GW.
  * Step 3. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection.
  * Step 4. The PDN GW deletes the IP CAN session associated with the UE and executes a PCEF-Initiated IPâ€‘CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [4].
  * Step 5. The PDN GW acknowledges with a Delete Session Response (Cause) message.
  * Step 6. TWAN sends WCS PDN disconnection response to the UE.
  * Step 7. If the PDN disconnection was initiated by the TWAG, then the UE is informed of the disconnection by means of a WCS PDN Disconnection Request (User Plane Connection ID).
  * Step 8. The UE acknowledges the disconnection request received in step 7.
> NOTE: Either step 1 and 6, or step 7 and 8, are performed. Step1 and 6 is
> used for UE initiated disconnection procedure, step7 and 8 is for TWAN
> initated disconnection procedure.

# 9 Conclusion
Editor\'s note: This clause will provide conclusions with respect to what
further specification work is required in order to provide the feature of S2a
mobility based on GTP and WLAN access to EPC.
## 9.1 Conclusion on SaMOG Phase 1
For the support of SaMOG without UE impact, it has been concluded that
Solution 2 (described in clause 7.1.2) is selected as the basis for normative
specifications:
\- The style of the reference model and call flows of Solution 1 (described in
clause 7.1.1.1, 7.1.1.2 and 7.1.1.3) will be used for documentation of the
normative specification, i.e., the internal structure of the WLAN Access
Network will not be exposed.
\- The L2 attach/detach triggers for solution 2 (described in clause 7.1.2.4)
will be used in the work of normative specifications. Only L2 attach triggers
are used for PDN type IPv6 and IPv4v6; L2 or L3 attach triggers may be used
for PDN type IPv4 as described in clause 9.1.1.
\- Enhancements on STa reference point in clause 7.1.1.1 will be used in the
work of normative specifications.
\- Simultaneous access for a UE to EPC through S2a and non-seamless offload
using a single SSID is not supported. For a network deployment, behaviour
described in clause 7.1.1.4 will be used in the work of normative
specifications.
\- Whether multiple TNAN functions are mapped to a single non-3GPP access
entity, or a single TNAN function is distributed among multiple non-3GPP
access entities is out-of-scope of 3GPP.
### 9.1.1 Conclusion on attach trigger solution
Two solutions are proposed in chapter 7.1. The main difference between the two
solutions is how the TNSP/TWAG is triggered to setup the S2a tunnel towards
the PGW. For the support of SaMOG without UE impact, it has been concluded
that:
After the successful authentication, the AAA in the TNAN (TNAP/TWAP) knows
from the UE profile the PDN type for the default APN. There are two
possibilities:
1\. PDN type = IPv6 or IPv4v6. In that case, TNAP/TWAP shall send a trigger
signal to the TNSP/TWAG. TNSP/TWAG establishes the S2a tunnel.
2\. PDN type = IPv4. In that case, S2a tunnel setup by the TNSP/TWAG is
triggered either by a signal from the TNAP/TWAP, or by a L3 trigger from the
UE. A trigger from the TNAP/TWAP is the recommended way.
In all cases, there shall be no difference on STa and S2a signaling.
NOTE: That this conclusion applies even though the call flows in clause 7.1
have not been updated to reflect this conclusion.
## 9.2 Conclusion on SaMOG Phase 2
###### ### Annex A: Example of WLAN integrated with Femto
For the Femto, the network will perform authentication and integrity checking
through AAA before the femto can be connect to the EPC. In addition, the IPSec
function in Femto can be used to build a secure transmission tunnel through
the backhaul to the EPC. Therefore, the WLAN module integrated with the Femto
box can leverage the authentication, integrity checking and the IPSec function
to build a trusted WLAN access for connectivity to the EPC.
