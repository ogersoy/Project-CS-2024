## 0.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations listed in 3GPP TR
21.905 [1] apply.
# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Definition
The term subscriber data is used to designate all information associated with
a subscription which is required for service provisions, identification,
authentication, routing, call handling, GPRS mode transmission, charging,
subscriber tracing, operation and maintenance purposes. Some subscriber data
are referred to as permanent subscriber data, i.e. they can only be changed by
administration means. Other data are temporary subscriber data which may
change as a result of normal operation of the system.
Unless shown to be conditional, all data items are considered to be mandatory.
## 1.2 Storage facilities
This specification considers subscriber data stored in the following types of
functional unit:
\- Home subscriber server (HSS) which contains all permanent subscriber data
and all relevant temporary subscriber data to support the call control and
session management entities of the different Domains and Subsystems.
\- Home location register (HLR) which contains all permanent subscriber data
and all relevant temporary subscriber data for all mobile subscribers
permanently registered in the HLR for CS and PS Domains.
NOTE 0: according to 3GPP TS 23.002 [50] HLR is a subset of the HSS
functionality.
\- CSG subscriber server (CSS) which contains Closed Subscriber Group
information data for inbound roaming UEs to enable VPLMN autonomous CSG
roaming in CS and PS domains.
\- Visitor location register (VLR) which contains all subscriber data required
for call handling and other purposes for mobile subscribers currently located
in the area controlled by the VLR.
\- Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) which contains all subscriber data
required for GPRS mode transmission and other purposes for mobile subscribers
currently located in the area controlled by the SGSN.
\- Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) which contains all subscriber data
required for GPRS mode transmission for mobile subscribers using any service
provided by the GGSN.
\- Mobility Management Entity (MME) which contains all subscriber data
required for EPS mode transmission and other purposes for mobile subscribers
currently located in the area controlled by the MME.
\- Serving GW (S-GW) which contains all subscriber data required for EPS mode
transmission for mobile subscribers currently served by the S-GW.
\- PDN GW (P-GW) which contains all subscriber data required for EPS mode
transmission for mobile subscribers using any service provided by the P-GW.
\- ePDG which contains all subscriber data required for EPS mode transmission
for mobile subscribers currently served by the ePDG via a non 3GPP access.
\- Gateway Mobile Location Center (GMLC) which contains all subscriber data
required for external clients of the Location Services (LCS).
\- In GSM, Serving Mobile Location Center (SMLC) which contains all LMU data
required to manage location measurements in LMUs.
NOTE 1: A type A LMU is a network entity that shares many of the attributes of
an MS including subscription data in the HLR and identification using an IMSI.
\- Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) which handles the session
states in the IP Multimedia (IM) Subsystem. Further definition of the S-CSCF
is provided in 3GPP 23.228 [42].
In addition, subscriber data may also be stored in the following functional
unit:
\- Group Call Register (GCR) which contains all data required for
configuration, set-up and handling of voice group and voice broadcast calls.
This encompasses subscribers identities (mobile as well as fixed network) who
are nominated as dispatchers for one or several groups within the area
controlled by the GCR.
NOTE 2: The data stored in the GCR is not strictly \"subscriber data\".
Description of GCR data is therefore out of scope of this specification and is
covered in the corresponding specifications for enhanced Multi Level
Precedence and Pre-emption Service (eMLPP), Voice Group Call Service (VGCS)
and Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) instead (3GPP TS 23.067 [12], 3GPP TS 43.068
[33] and 3GPP TS 43.069 [34]).
NOTE 3: The MME and SGSN Emergency Configuration Data, which are applied for
all emergency bearer services, are not subscriber data and therefore out of
the scope of this specification. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [74] and 3GPP TS 23.060
[21].
## 1.3 Subscriber data in functional units other than the HLR, HSS, VLR, SGSN,
S4-SGSN, GGSN, MME, S-GW, P-GW, ePDG, GMLC, SMLC and LMU
The individual Subscriber Authentication Key Ki defined in 3GPP TS 43.020 [31]
is stored in the Authentication Centre (AuC); it is also stored in the SIM and
therefore available in the MS. Version numbers of algorithms A3 and A8 may
also be stored in the AuC.
Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) handles subscriber's bootstrapping
information after bootstrapping procedure in Generic Authentication
Architecture (GAA) system. A bootstrapping procedure creates security
association between an UE and a BSF. Using the stored user's bootstrapping
information and the security association the BSF can provide security services
to network application functions (NAF) contacted by the UE. Functions of the
BSF are defined in 3GPP TS 33.220 [58] and 3GPP TS 29.109 [59].
NOTE: It is for further study whether or not other types of functional units
containing mobile subscriber parameters are to be included in this
specification. Such units could include encryption key distribution centres,
maintenance centres, etc.
## 1.4 Subscriber data in WLAN-IW functional units
This specification considers subscriber data stored in the following types of
functional unit for I‑WLAN:
\- 3GPP AAA Server which contains all subscriber data necessary to maintain
WLAN Direct IP Access and WLAN 3GPP IP Access.
\- 3GPP AAA Proxy which contains subscriber data necessary to perform AAA
proxy functionality in the VPLMN and to provide charging inter operator
settlement functionality.
\- Packet Data Gateway (PDG) which contains all subscriber data necessary to
manage WLAN 3GPP IP Access tunnels.
\- WLAN Access Gateway (WAG) which contains all subscriber data necessary to
manage a per user firewall between the WLAN-AN and PLMN and to perform per
tunnel charging.
# 2 Definition of subscriber data for CS and PS domain
## 2.1 Data related to subscription, identification and numbering
### 2.1.1 Data defining the subscription profile
#### 2.1.1.1 International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003
[5].
IMSI is permanent subscriber data. IMSI is stored in HLR, HSS, CSS, VLR, SGSN,
S4-SGSN, GGSN, MME, S-GW, P-GW, ePDG and SMLC. For Anonymous Access, IMSI is
not used in SGSN nor in GGSN. The IMSI serves as the root of the subscriber
data pseudo-tree.
For emergency attached UEs without IMSI (e.g; UICCless UE) or with an
unauthenticated IMSI, IMEI is used instead of IMSI to identify the UE.
#### 2.1.1.2 Network Access Mode (NAM)
The Network Access Mode (NAM) defines if the subscriber is registered to get
access to the CS (non-GPRS/EPS network), to the PS (GPRS/EPS) network or to
both networks. NAM describes the first level of the subscriber data pseudo-
tree below the IMSI root. It is permanent subscriber data stored in the
HSS/HLR and the SGSN with the Gs interface option, and the MME with the SGs
interface option.
#### 2.1.1.3 IMSI Unauthenticated indicator
For an emergency attached UE with an unauthenticated IMSI, the IMSI
Unauthenticated indicator is set to reflect that the IMSI is unauthenticated.
See 3GPP TS 23.401 [74] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [21].
The IMSI Unauthenticated indicator is a temporary subscriber data stored in
the MME, S-GW, P-GW, SGSN, S4-SGSN, GGSN
### 2.1.2 Mobile Station International ISDN Number (MSISDN)
Mobile Station ISDN Number (MSISDN) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The MSISDN is permanent subscriber data and is conditionally stored in HLR,
VLR, SGSN, GGSN, HSS, MME, S-GW, P-GW, 3GPP AAA Server and ePDG(for GTP-based
S2b only), and is optionally stored in CSS. If the multinumbering option
applies, the MSISDN stored in the VLR and in the Gn/Gp-SGSN is the Basic
MSISDN, see subclause 2.1.3.1.
### 2.1.3 MSISDNs for multinumbering option
If the HPLMN allocates different MSISDNs for different Basic Services (see
3GPP TS 29.007 [28]), these numbers are conditionally stored as permanent data
in the HLR.
#### 2.1.3.1 The Basic MSISDN indicator
The Basic MSISDN is defined in 3GPP TS 23.012 [8]. The Basic MSISDN indicator
marks the MSISDN to be used as Basic MSISDN.
It is permanent subscriber data stored conditionally in the HLR.
#### 2.1.3.2 The MSISDN-Alert indicator
The MSISDN-Alert is defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [10]. The MSISDN-Alert indicator
marks the MSISDN to be used as MSISDN-Alert.

accompanied by the P-TMSI Signature, see subclause 2.3.7.
The P-TMSI is temporary subscriber data and is conditionally stored in the
SGSN.
### 2.1.6 Temporary Link Layer Identifier (TLLI)
Temporary Link Layer Identifier (TLLI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]. It is
derived from the P-TMSI by the MS and occurs in the variants Local TLLI and
Foreign TLLI. The TLLI is temporary subscriber data and is conditionally
stored in the SGSN. For use of TLLI see 3GPP TS 23.060 [11].
### 2.1.7 Random TLLI
Random TLLI is chosen randomly by the MS. It is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
Random TLLI is short living temporary subscriber data and is conditionally
stored in the SGSN. For use of Random TLLI see 3GPP TS 23.060 [11].
A Random TLLI may be used if no valid P-TMSI is available.
### 2.1.8 Local Mobile Station Identity (LMSI)
Local Mobile Station Identity (LMSI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]. The
LMSI is temporary subscriber data. The LMSI may be stored in the VLR; if it is
received in the HLR it must be stored there.
### 2.1.9 International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)

### 2.1.10 External Identifier Set
The External Identifier set contains one or more External Identifier as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
Any one of the External Identifier from the IMSI\'s External Identifier Set
shall uniquely identify a single subscriber (IMSI).
The External Identifier Set is permanent subscriber data and is stored in the
HSS.
## 2.2 Data related to Mobile Station types

Party\'s Category\" defined in ISUP (ITU‑T Recommendation Q.763 [38]).
The following values of category shall be supported:
\- ordinary subscriber.
The category is assigned per IMSI.
Mobile Station Category is permanent subscriber data and is stored in HLR and
VLR.
### 2.2.2 LMU Identifier (GSM only)
The LMU identifier is part of the subscriber data for a Type A LMU, when
associated with an NSS based SMLC, and serves to distinguish a Type A LMU from
a normal MS.
### 2.2.3 International Mobile Equipment Identity and Software Version
(IMEISV)

Random Number (RAND), Signed Response (SRES) and Ciphering Key (Kc) form a
triplet vector used for authentication and encryption as defined in 3GPP TS
43.020 [31].
For GSM users, triplet vectors are calculated in the 2G AuC and provided to
the 2G HLR (see GSM 12.03 [36]), and for UMTS users triplet vectors are
derived from quintuplet vectors in the 3G HLR or 3G VLR, if needed (see 3GPP
TS 33.102 [52]).
A set of up to 5 triplet values are sent from the 2G HLR to the VLR and the
SGSN on request. These data are temporary subscriber data conditionally stored
in the VLR and the SGSN.
### 2.3.2 Random Challenge (RAND), Expected Response (XRES), Cipher Key (CK),
Integrity Key(IK) and Authentication Token(AUTN), KASME
Random Challenge (RAND), Expected Response (XRES), Cipher Key (CK), Integrity
Key(IK) and Authentication Token (AUTN) form a quintuplet vector used for user
authentication, data confidentiality and data integrity as defined in 3GPP TS
33.102 [52].
Random Challenge (RAND), Expected Response (XRES), Key for Access Security
Management Entity (KASME) and Authentication Token (AUTN) form an EPS vector
used for user authentication, data confidentiality and data integrity as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.401 [73].
When both HLR and VLR or SGSN are 3G, a set of quintuplet vectors are
calculated in the AuC, and up to 5 quintuplets are sent from the HLR to the
VLR and to the SGSN on request (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [27]). These data are
temporary subscriber data conditionally stored in the HLR, the VLR and the
SGSN.
When the HLR is 2G and the VLR or SGSN are 3G, quintuplet vectors are derived
by the 3G VLR or SGSN from the received triplet vectors from the HLR, if
needed (see 3GPP TS 33.102 [52]).
### 2.3.3 The Ciphering Key Sequence Number (CKSN)
The Ciphering Key Sequence Number (CKSN) is used to ensure GSM authentication
information (Kc) consistency between the MS and the VLR and between the MS and
the SGSN.
CKSN and its handling are defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [26] and 3GPP TS 43.020
[31]. It is a temporary subscriber data and is stored in the VLR and in the
SGSN.

Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
NOTE: There may be more than one MSRN simultaneously per IMSI.
The MSRN is short-lived temporary subscriber data stored in the VLR.
### 2.4.2 Location Area Identification (LAI)
Location Area Identification (LAI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The LAI is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the VLR.
### 2.4.3 Routing Area Identification (RAI)
Routing Area Identification (RAI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The RAI is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the SGSN.
### 2.4.4 Void
### 2.4.5 VLR number
VLR number is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The VLR number is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the HLR. Absence
of the VLR number in HLR indicates that the mobile station is deregistered for
non-GPRS or the subscriber has not a non-GPRS subscription in the HLR. The VLR
number is stored in the SGSN with the Gs interface option. For usage of the
VLR number in SGSN, please refer to 3GPP TS 23.060 [21].
The VLR number is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the CSS. Absence
of the VLR number in the CSS indicates that no subsequent update of the CSG
subscription information is needed at the VLR upon CSG subscription change.
### 2.4.6 MSC number
MSC number is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The MSC number is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the HLR and
conditionally in the VLR. For absence of the MSC number in the HLR, the
remarks on VLR number apply accordingly, see subclause 2.4.5.
### 2.4.7 HLR number
HLR number is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The HLR number may be stored in the VLR and Gn/Gp-SGSN. It is received as a
mandatory parameter in the updating location accepted message. This data may
be needed to retrieve subscribers to be restored after HLR reset.
The HLR number is temporary subscriber data and may optionally be stored in
the VLR and Gn/Gp-SGSN.
### 2.4.8 GSN number
#### 2.4.8.0 General
GSN number occurs as SGSN number and as GGSN number.
#### 2.4.8.1 SGSN number
SGSN number is the SS7 address of the SGSN . It is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003
[5].
The SGSN number is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the HLR for a
GPRS subscription. It is conditionally stored in the VLR if the Gs interface
is installed. Absence of the SGSN number in the HLR indicates that the mobile
station is deregistered for GPRS or the subscriber has no GPRS subscription in
the HLR. Absence of the SGSN number in the VLR indicates that there is no
association between the VLR and the SGSN for this MS. The SGSN number is to be
distinguished from the SGSN address described in subclause 2.13.10.
The SGSN number is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the CSS. Absence
of the SGSN number in the CSS indicates that no subsequent update of the CSG
subscription information is needed at the SGSN upon CSG subscription change.
#### 2.4.8.2 GGSN number
GGSN number is the SS7 address of the GGSN .It is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003
[5]. Its usage is described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [21]. It is contained in the
GGSN-list stored in the HLR and does not appear as separate subscriber data.
Cf. subclause 2.13.11.
#### 2.4.8.3 IWF number
IWF number is the SS7 address of the IWF. It has the same format as a \"VLR
number\" or \"SGSN number\" which are defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]. Its usage
is described in 3GPP TS 29.305 [83].
### 2.4.9 MLC number
The MLC number occurs as an SMLC number and as a GMLC number.
#### 2.4.9.1 SMLC number (GSM only)
The SMLC number is the E.164 address of an NSS based SMLC.
The SMLC number is permanent data that may be stored in an MSC in association
with either a set of IMSIs belonging to LMUs controlled by the SMLC or a set
of cell identifiers belonging to the geographic area served by the SMLC.
#### 2.4.9.2 GMLC number
The GMLC number is the E.164 address of the GMLC. One or more GMLC numbers may
be stored in the MS subscriber data in the HLR and downloaded to the VLR and
SGSN. These GMLC numbers identify the GMLCs for the particular MS from which a
location request for this MS may be confined for particular LCS clients.
### 2.4.10 Subscription restriction
Subscription restriction is a parameter indicating whether or not certain
restrictions apply to the subscription. The parameter takes either of the
following values (see also GSM 02.13 [36]):
\- accessible area for service;
\- all GSM PLMNs;
\- one national and all foreign GSM PLMNs;
\- regionally restricted (part of a GSM PLMN in one country);
\- regionally restricted plus all other GSM PLMNs.
The HLR/HSS associates location updating information with subscription
restriction. It deregisters the MS if the PLMN is not allowed and sets:
\- the MSC area restricted flag if the MSC area is not allowed, see subclause
2.4.12;
\- SGSN area restricted flag if the SGSN area is not allowed, see subclause
2.4.14.
Handling of Regionally Restricted Subscription is defined in subclause 2.4.11.
By operator agreement, regional restriction in parts of different GSM PLMNs is
also possible.
The subscription restriction is permanent subscriber data and is stored in the
HLR.
### 2.4.11 Regional Subscription Information
If a mobile subscriber has a regional subscription, the HLR/HSS shall store a
list of up to ten Regional Subscription Zone Identities (RSZIs) per Network
Destination Code (NDC) of the PLMN involved. The structure of RSZI is defined
in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]; since it is composed of the PLMN identification (CC
NDC) and the Zone Code it is sufficient to store the Zone Code List per CC
NDC.
On updating the MME, VLR or the SGSN, the HLR/HSS identifies the VPLMN and NDC
given by the VLR or SGSN number or VPLMN-Id and transfers the pertaining Zone
Code List to the VLR or SGSN or MME. The VLR or SGSN or MME derives from the
Zone Code List the allowed and not allowed MSC or SGSN or MME areas and
location areas; it sets the \"LA not allowed flag\" should the target LAI of
the mobile station be excluded, and it informs the HLR/HSS should the MSC or
SGSN or MME area be excluded. Signalling of cause value \"location area not
allowed\" towards the mobile station is defined in TSs 3GPP TS 29.002 [27] and
3GPP TS 24.008 [26].
#### 2.4.11.1 RSZI lists
The RSZI lists are permanent subscriber data stored conditionally in the
HLR/HSS.
#### 2.4.11.2 Zone Code List
The VLR and the SGSN and the MME shall store as permanent and conditional
subscriber data at least those Zone Codes by which they are affected.
### 2.4.12 MSC area restricted flag
MSC area restricted flag is a parameter which can take either of the following
values:
\- MSC area restricted;
\- MSC area not restricted.
The parameter is set in the HLR during updating of the VLR. Handling of
unsupported services and information received from the VLR based on national
roaming or regionally restricted subscription (subclause 2.4.11) determine its
value. The parameter contributes to the \"MS Not Reachable\" state for
handling of terminating traffic in the HLR. The default value is \"MSC area
not restricted\".
The MSC area restricted flag is temporary subscriber data and is contained in
the HLR.
### 2.4.13 LA not allowed flag
The LA not allowed flag is set in the VLR depending on National Roaming,
Regionally Restricted Subscription and Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported
Feature, see 3GPP TS 29.002. It is applied to restrict service on a location
area basis.
The LA not allowed flag is temporary subscriber data stored in the VLR.
### 2.4.14 SGSN area restricted flag
SGSN area restricted flag is a parameter which can take either of the
following values:
\- SGSN area restricted;
\- SGSN area not restricted.
The parameter is set in the HLR during updating of the SGSN. Handling of
unsupported services and information received from the SGSN based on national
roaming or regionally restricted subscription (subclause 2.4.11) determine its
value. The parameter contributes to the \"MS Not Reachable\" state for
handling of terminating traffic in the HLR. The default value is \"SGSN area
not restricted\".
The SGSN area restricted flag is temporary subscriber data and is contained in
the HLR.
### 2.4.14a RA not allowed flag
The RA not allowed flag is set in the SGSN depending on National Roaming,
Regionally Restricted Subscription and Roaming Restricted in the SGSN Due To
Unsupported Feature, see 3GPP TS 29.002. It is applied to restrict service on
a routing area basis.
The RA not allowed flag is temporary subscriber data stored in the SGSN.
### 2.4.14b TA not allowed flag
The TA not allowed flag is set in the MME depending on National Roaming,
Regionally Restricted Subscription and Roaming Restricted in the MME Due To
Unsupported Feature, see 3GPP TS 29.272[81]. It is applied to restrict service
on a tracking area basis.
The TA not allowed flag is temporary subscriber data stored in the MME.
### 2.4.15 Service restriction data induced by roaming
If in the course of roaming or at updating of the VLR or SGSN or MMEthe
HLR/HSS is informed that the VLR or SGSN or MME does not support certain
sensitive services or features, or, the HLR/HSS is informed in data request
that the VLR or the SGSN or the MME supports only specific services, features
or phases which do not correspond to subscribed services, features or phases,
the HLR/HSS takes appropriate measures to restrict service for the mobile
station in that VLR or SGSN or MME by setting and sending network induced
replacing services such as available services, features or phases, barring
programs or the roaming restriction for the MSC or SGSN or MME area.
These network-induced data have to be kept separate in the HLR, and where
possible as discussed below in the VLR, from the permanent subscriber data of
the call barring supplementary services, from the barring related data that
can be modified by the subscriber or from the permanent regional subscription
data.
These network-induced data have to be kept separate in the HLR/HSS, and where
possible as discussed below in the SGSN and MME, from the permanent regional
subscription data.
The network induced data take precedence over the subscriber data of the user
where they are in conflict. If, in the course of roaming, restrictions caused
by a service are lifted, the original subscriber data have to be re-installed
both in HLR, in SGSN, in MME and in VLR when applicable, regarding any
remaining restrictions due to other service replacements.
All network-induced restriction data are temporary subscriber data.
For ODB, 3GPP TS 23.015 [9] recommends mainly barring programs to replace this
feature. The replacing barring data are conditionally stored in the HLR and
VLR. In the VLR they cannot be distinguished from the permanent supplementary
services data with the available signalling means, and no additional storage
is needed. Interrogation shall reflect in both HLR and VLR the valid setting
of the replacing temporary data; to prevent interference with Subscriber
Controlled Input and to inform the customer on the restriction, the \"control
of barring services\" subscription option is also temporarily set to the value
\"by the service provider\".
CUG is also replaced by Outgoing Call Barring as described in 3GPP TS 23.085
[18].
Roaming restriction in the MSC area due to unsupported features is used to
replace AoCC, see 3GPP TS 23.086, and Zone Codes for regional subscription,
see subclause 2.4.11 and 3GPP TS 29.002. A flag in the HLR and the VLR, see
subclause 2.4.15.2, collects the sources of network-induced roaming
restriction which are also kept separate by the HLR.
Roaming restriction in the SGSN area due to unsupported features is used to
replace Zone Codes for regional subscription, see subclause 2.4.11 and 3GPP TS
29.002. A flag in the HLR and the SGSN, see subclause 2.4.15.3, collects the
sources of network-induced roaming restriction which are also kept separate by
the HLR.
Roaming restriction in the MME area due to unsupported features is used to
replace Zone Codes for regional subscription, see subclause 2.4.11 and 3GPP TS
29.272[81]. A flag in the HSS and the MME, see subclause 2.4.15.3a, collects
the sources of network-induced roaming restriction which are also kept
separate by the HSS.
#### 2.4.15.1 ODB-induced barring data
ODB-induced barring data are temporary data stored conditionally in the HLR;
they include the necessary replacing barring programs for outgoing and
incoming calls depending on the ODB profile. The subscription option \"control
of barring services\" is set to \"by the service provider\". The corresponding
barring supplementary services for outgoing calls are set by the HLR and sent
to the VLR.
#### 2.4.15.2 Roaming restriction due to unsupported feature
Roaming restriction due to unsupported feature is a parameter which indicates
that one or several services or features are not supported by the MSC,
resulting in roaming restriction in the MSC area. It can take either of the
following values:
\- roaming restricted;
\- roaming not restricted.
The parameter governs the \"LA not allowed flag\" in the VLR (see subclause
2.4.13) and the \"MSC area restricted flag\" in the HLR (see subclause
2.4.12); see also 3GPP TS 29.002.
The flag \"roaming restriction due to unsupported feature\" is temporary
subscriber data stored in the VLR and in the HLR.
#### 2.4.15.3 Roaming restricted in the SGSN due to unsupported feature
Roaming restricted in the SGSN due to unsupported feature is a parameter which
indicates that one or several services or features are not supported by the
SGSN, resulting in roaming restriction in the SGSN area. It can take either of
the following values:
\- roaming restricted;
\- roaming not restricted.
The parameter governs the \"RA not allowed flag\" in the SGSN (see subclause
2.4.14a) and the \"SGSN area restricted flag\" in the HLR (see subclause
2.4.14); see also 3GPP TS 29.002.
The flag \"roaming restricted in the SGSN due to unsupported feature\" is
temporary subscriber data stored in the SGSN and in the HLR.
#### 2.4.15.3a Roaming restricted in the MME due to unsupported feature
Roaming restricted in the MME due to unsupported feature is a parameter which
indicates that one or several services or features are not supported by the
MME, resulting in roaming restriction in the MME area. It can take either of
the following values:
\- roaming restricted;
\- roaming not restricted.
The parameter governs the \"TA not allowed flag\" in the MME (see subclause
2.4.14b).
The flag \"roaming restricted in the MME due to unsupported feature\" is
temporary subscriber data stored in the MME and in the HSS.
### 2.4.16 Cell Global ID or Service Area ID
The Cell Global ID or Service Area ID indicates the cell global identity of
the cell in GSM (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]) or the service area identification of
the service area in UMTS (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]) in which the MS is currently
in radio contact or in which the MS was last in radio contact. The VLR and
SGSN shall update the stored Cell Global ID or Service Area ID at
establishment of every radio connection.
The cell ID is temporary subscriber data stored in the VLR and SGSN. It is
conditional data, the VLR and SGSN shall store it whenever the subscriber data
is marked as confirmed by radio contact.
The Cell Global ID or Service Area ID is temporary subscriber data stored in
SGSN and GGSN/PDN-GW.
### 2.4.16A E-UTRAN Cell Global ID
The E-UTRAN Cell Global ID indicates the cell global identity of the cell in
EPS (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]) in which the MS is currently in radio contact or
in which the MS was last in radio contact.
The E-UTRAN Cell Global ID is temporary subscriber data stored in MME, PDN-GW
and, when received via the SGs interface, in the VLR.
### 2.4.17 Localised Service Area Information
If a mobile subscriber has a localised service area subscription, the HLR
shall store a list of up to 20 Localised Service Area Identities (LSA IDs) per
PLMN. The structure of LSA ID is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
On updating the VLR or the Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HLR identifies the VPLMN given by
the VLR or SGSN number and transfers the applicable LSA ID List to the VLR or
Gn/Gp-SGSN. The VLR or Gn/Gp-SGSN derives from the LSA ID List the allowed
LSA(s), priority of each LSA, the preferential access indicator, the active
mode support indicator and active mode indication and the \"LSA only access\"
indicator.
#### 2.4.17.1 LSA Identity
LSA Identity (LSA ID) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]. The element uniquely
identifies a LSA.
#### 2.4.17.2 LSA Priority
Localised Service Area Priority (LSA Priority) is defined in GSM 08.08. The
LSA Priority is permanent subscriber data stored conditionally in the HLR.
#### 2.4.17.2A LSA Preferential Access Indicator
The Localised Service Area Preferential Access Indicator defines if the
subscriber shall be favoured in cells belonging to the LSA at resource
allocation compared to other subscribers. The LSA Preferential Access
Indicator is permanent subscriber data stored conditionally in the HLR.
#### 2.4.17.2B LSA Active Mode Support Indicator
The Localised Service Area Active Mode Support Indicator defines if cells
belonging to the LSA shall be favoured for the subscriber compared to other
cells at resource allocation. The LSA Active Mode Indicator is permanent
subscriber data stored conditionally in the HLR.
#### 2.4.17.3 LSA Only Access Indicator
The LSA Only Access Indicator defines if the subscriber is only allowed within
its subscribed LSAs. The LSA Only Access Indicator is permanent subscriber
data stored conditionally in the HLR.
#### 2.4.17.4 LSA Active Mode Indicator
The Localised Service Area Active Mode Indicator defines if the LSA Identity
of the cell in which the MS is currently in radio contact with shall be
indicated to the subscriber in active mode. The LSA Active Mode Indicator is
permanent subscriber data stored conditionally in the HLR.
#### 2.4.17.5 VPLMN Identifier
The VPLMN Identifier identifies the VPLMN in which an LSA Identity is
applicable. This identifier is not applicable to Universal LSA IDs as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]. The VPLMN identifier is permanent subscriber data
stored conditionally in the HLR.
### 2.4.18 Access Restriction Data
The use of this data is described in 3GPP TS 23.221 [57].
The Access Restriction Data is permanent subscriber data and is conditionally
stored in the HLR/HSS, the VLR, the SGSN and the MME.
The parameter takes either of the following values:
\- GERAN not allowed, the subscriber shall not be allowed to access the
network in GERAN radio access. Valid for Idle and Connected mode;
\- UTRAN not allowed, the subscriber shall not be allowed to access the
network in LA/RAs using a UTRAN radio access. Valid for Idle and Connected

the network in LA/RAs using I-HSPA-Evolution radio access. Valid for Idle and
Connected mode;
\- HO-To-Non-3GPP-Access not allowed, the subscriber shall not be allowed to
handover to non-3GPP access.
The use of this parameter for LA/RA/TA update procedures is described in 3GPP
TS 23.012 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [21], and 3GPP TS 23.401 [74].
### 2.4.19 Selected CN operator ID
The selected CN operator ID indicates which core network operator Network
Sharing supporting UEs have chosen in a shared network. The use of this data
is described in 3GPP TS 23.251 [61]. And this data is identified by a PLMN ID
(MCC+MNC) as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The selected CN operator ID is temporary subscriber data stored conditionally
in the VLR and the SGSN in a shared network for non-GPRS and GPRS services
respectively.
This data is also stored in VLR for GPRS services if the Gs inerface is
installed.
### 2.4.20 IP-SM-GW number
The IP-SM-GW number indicates the address of the external IP-SM-GW that is
registered for a subscriber to be used for delivering mobile terminated short
messages. The IP-SM-GW number is temporary subscriber data and is stored
conditionally in the HLR. The absence of the IP-SM-GW number in the HLR
indicates that no external IP-SM-GW is registered; in this case an IP-SM-GW
number pre-configured in the HLR can be used as an alternative route for
delivering mobile terminated short messages.
### 2.4.21 Paging Area
As an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging
Areas. A Paging Area is a list of up to 5 Location Areas. The structure of the
Location Area is specified in 3GPP TS 29.002 [27]. The Paging Area is
temporary data stored in the VLR and in the HLR.
The use of this data is described in TS 23.012 [8] and in TS 23.018 [70].
### 2.4.22 Closed Subscriber Group Information
If a mobile subscriber has a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) subscription, the
HLR/HSS shall store Closed Subscriber Group Information which is a list of up
to 50 CSG-Ids per PLMN and for each CSG-Id optionally an associated expiration
date which indicates the point in time when the subscription to the CSG-Id
expires and optionally corresponding APNs which can be accessed via Local IP
access from this CSG identified by the CSG-Id; an absent expiration date
indicates unlimited subscription; an expired expiration date may indicate that
removal of the CSG-Id from the UE (e.g. by OMA DM or OTA update) is pending.
The structure of CSG-Id is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
On updating the VLR or the SGSN or MME, the HSS/HLR identifies and stores the
VPLMN and the list of equivalent PLMNs provided by the VLR, SGSN or MME, and
transfers the applicable CSG-Ids, expiration dates and the APNs allowed for
LIPA (if present) to the VLR or SGSN or MME.
If an applicable (i.e. applicable for the current serving PLMN) CSG-Id is
added to the Closed Subscriber Group Information in the subscriber data in the
HLR/HSS, or an expiration date for an applicable CSG-Id is changed (added,
modified or removed), or the APNs allowed for LIPA for an applicable CSG-Id is
changed (added, modified or removed), then the HLR/HSS shall transfer
applicable CSG-Ids, expiration dates, and APNs allowed for LIPA to the VLR or
SGSN or MME.
NOTE 1: The APNs allowed for LIPA information are not applicable to the VLR.
When a CSG-Id expires, or the expiration date is changed (added or modified)
to an expired date, the CSG-Id should be removed from the UE (e.g. by OMA DM
or OTA update). After successful removal of the CSG-Id from the UE, the
HLR/HSS should delete the CSG-Id and, if applicable, update the VLR or SGSN or
MME. The two operations may not be correlated in the sense that they may be
performed independently by different systems. The temporal relationship
between the two operations is out scope of this specification and therefore
depends on the operator policy.
If the subscription is terminated by other means than expiry, then CSG-Ids
that are not expired should not be removed at the HLR/HSS; rather the
expiration date may be modified to an expired date.
CSG-Ids that are expired should not be removed from the HLR/HSS before being
removed from the UE.
NOTE 2: In the VLR or SGSN or MME an expired CSG-Id subscription indicates
that the UE is not allowed service in the CSG. However, since the CSG-Id
removal from the UE is pending, the UE may still camp on that CSG and
therefore the UE may still be paged in the CSG.
Closed Subscriber Group Information is permanent subscriber data and is
conditionally stored in HLR/HSS, VLR, SGSN, and MME.
### 2.4.23 Service Centre Address
The Service Centre Address, specified in the 3GPP TS 29.002 [27], represents
the address of a Short Message Service Centre.
It is permanent subscriber data and is stored conditionally in the HLR/HSS and
the IP-SM-GW (AS).
### 2.4.24 Subscribed Periodic LAU Timer
The Subscribed Periodic LAU Timer value (see 3GPP TS 23.012 [8]) is permanent
data conditionally stored in the HLR and VLR. The use of this data is
described in 3GPP TS 23.012 [8].
### 2.4.25 CSS number
CSS number is the international ISDN number of the CSS. It is defined in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [5].
The CSS number is temporary subscriber data and is conditionally stored in the
VLR and Gn/Gp-SGSN.
### 2.4.26 VPLMN Closed Subscriber Group Information
If the VPLMN supports VPLMN Autonomous CSG Roaming by providing CSG membership
to the roaming subscriber, the CSS shall store Closed Subscriber Group
Information which is a list of up to 50 CSG-Ids in the VPLMN and for each CSG-
Id optionally an associated expiration date which indicates the point in time
when the subscription to the CSG-Id expires; an absent expiration date
indicates unlimited subscription. The structure of CSG-Id is defined in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [5].
NOTE 1: The HPLMN enables Autonomous CSG Roaming in the VPLMN via Service
Level Agreement.
When a CSG-Id expires, or the expiration date is changed (added or modified)
to an expired date, the CSG-Id may be removed from the CSS and the VLR or SGSN
or MME based on implementation.
NOTE 2: In the VLR or SGSN or MME an expired CSG-Id subscription indicates
that the UE is not allowed service in the CSG. However, since the CSG-Id
removal from the UE is pending, the UE may still camp on that CSG and
therefore the UE may still be paged in the CSG.
If the subscription is terminated by other means than expiry, then CSG-Ids
that are not expired should not be removed at the CSS; rather the expiration
date may be modified to an expired date and then be updated by the CSS to the
VLR or SGSN or MME.
VPLMN Closed Subscriber Group Information as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [27]
and 3GPP TS 29.272 [81] is permanent subscriber data and is conditionally
stored in CSS, VLR, SGSN, and MME.
## 2.5 Data related to basic services
### 2.5.1 Provision of bearer service
Provision of bearer service is a parameter identifying whether a bearer
service is provisioned to the mobile subscriber or not. This provision can be
achieved through subscription of the mobile subscriber or the bearer service
can be generally available. The parameter \"provision of bearer service\" must
be set for the bearer service defined in 3GPP TS 22.002 [2] for which a
subscription is required.
Provision of bearer service is permanent subscriber data and is stored in the
HLR and VLR.
### 2.5.2 Provision of teleservice
Provision of teleservice is a parameter identifying whether a teleservice is
provisioned to the mobile subscriber or not. This provision can be achieved
through subscription of the mobile subscriber or the teleservice can be
generally available. The parameter \"provision of teleservice\" must be set
for the teleservices defined in GSM 02.03 [36]for which a subscription is
required.
Provision of teleservice is permanent subscriber data and is stored in the
HLR, Gn/Gp-SGSN and VLR.
### 2.5.3 Bearer capability allocation
Bearer capability allocation is a parameter stored against each ISDN number in
the case when the Home PLMN allocates one directory number per teleservice and
bearer service. In this case it is used to permit the establishment of the
correct bearer capability on the connection to the MS. (See 3GPP TS 29.007
[28]). The bearer capability allocation is not required when the Home PLMN
only allocates one directory number per subscriber for all bearer services and
teleservices. It is permanent data stored conditionally in the3GPP TS 43.020
[31].
### 2.5.4 Transfer of SM option
Transfer of SM option is a parameter indicating which path should be used for
transfer of Terminating Short Message when GPRS is not supported by the GMSC.
Two options are possible:
\- transfer of SM via the MSC when GPRS is not supported in the GMSC: this
option is used to indicate that SM shall always be sent via the MSC when the
GMSC does not support the GPRS functionality;
\- transfer of SM via the Gn/Gp-SGSN when GPRS is not supported in the GMSC:
this option is used to indicate that SM shall always be sent via the Gn/Gp-
SGSN when the GMSC does not support the GPRS functionality.
Transfer of SM option is permanent subscriber data stored in HLR for a GPRS
subscription.
The data has an interim nature since in the final solution, the decision on SM
Transfer is taken in the SMS-GMSC.
## 2.6 Data related to supplementary services
Subscriber data related to supplementary services are contained in the 3GPP TS
23.08x and 3GPP TS 23.09x series of Technical Specifications, that is 3GPP TS

The HLR column indicates only GPRS related use, i.e. if the HLR uses a
parameter in non-GPRS Network Access Mode but not in GPRS Network Access Mode,
it is not mentioned in this table 5.2.
NOTE 1: This parameter is relevant in the SGSN only when the Gs interface is
installed.
NOTE 2: The VLR column is applicable if Gs interface is installed. It only
indicates GPRS related data to be stored and is only relevant to GPRS
subscribers registered in VLR.
For special condition of storage see in clause 2. See clause 4 for explanation
of M, C, T and P in table 5.2.
