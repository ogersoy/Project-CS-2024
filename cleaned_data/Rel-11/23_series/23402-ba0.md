# Introduction
Guidance to Readers of this Specification
In order to reduce the number of procedures in this specification certain
editorial practices have been adopted. Though there are many independent
factors, such as variants of S5/S8/S2b and attachment cases, these are in
essence quite similar. So, rather than presenting the permutations of these
factors separately and thereby needlessly repeating normative text,
conventions have been adopted to combine this information in single
procedures.
The S5 and S8 reference points in the EPC architecture have been defined to
have both a GTP and PMIP variant. The GTP variant is documented in TS 23.401
[4], while the PMIP variant is documented in this specification. Every effort
has been made to eliminate duplication of normative text common to both
specifications. Many figures in this specification refer to procedures in TS
23.401 [4] to achieve this end. Common procedures between TS 23.401 [4] and TS
23.402 (this specification), are represented in this specification in figures
by text in shaded box(es) that reference the appropriate figure and steps in
TS 23.401 [4]. The details of the common steps are only captured in TS 23.401
[4].
The S2b reference point in the EPC architecture has also been defined to have
both a GTP and PMIP variant. Both variants are documented in this
specification. Every effort has been made to eliminate duplication of
normative text common to both variants. Figures for the GTP variant of S2b
refer to figures defined for the PMIP variant of S2b to achieve this end.
Common procedures for both variants are represented in figures for GTP based
S2b by text in shaded box(es) that reference the appropriate figure and steps
defined for PMIP based S2b. The details of the common steps are only captured
for the PMIP variant of S2b.
Attachment cases (as discussed in clauses 6.2.1 and 7.2.1) have been combined
in a single figure. The different attachment cases can be accommodated by
including optional items in the flows, for instance, a vPCRF that is only
employed during when a roaming case or LBO is specified.
Multiple APN interactions may occur for many of the procedures defined in this
specification. These interactions complicate the flows by introducing certain
operations that may occur multiple times. Rather than produce unique flows for
this purpose, we indicate where this possibility may occur in text.
# 1 Scope
This document specifies the stage 2 service description for providing IP
connectivity using non-3GPP accesses to the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched
domain. In addition, for E-UTRAN and non-3GPP accesses, the specification
describes the Evolved 3GPP PS Domain where the protocols between its Core
Network elements are IETF-based.
ITU-T Recommendation I.130 [2] describes a three-stage method for
characterisation of telecommunication services, and ITU-T Recommendation Q.65
[3] defines stage 2 of the method.
The specification covers both roaming and non-roaming scenarios and covers all
aspects, including mobility between 3GPP and non 3GPP accesses, policy control
and charging, and authentication, related to the usage of non-3GPP accesses.
TS 23.401 [4] covers architecture aspects common to the Evolved 3GPP Packet
Switched domain.

# 4 Architecture Model and Concepts
## 4.1 Concepts
### 4.1.0 General Concepts
The EPS supports the use of non-3GPP IP access networks to access the EPC.
The EPS supports network-based mobility management mechanism based on PMIP or
GTP and host-based mobility management mechanism (e.g., MIP) over S2 reference
points.
The EPS supports IETF-based network-based mobility management mechanism (i.e.
PMIP) over S5 and S8 reference points.
When host-based mobility protocol (DSMIPv6 [10]) is used within the EPS and
the UE camps on a 3GPP access network, in this specification the UE is
considered to be on its home link.
NOTE: A scenario where the UE in EPS uses a host based mobility protocol with
a HA that is outside the EPS is out of the scope of 3GPP specification.
The mobility management procedures specified to handle mobility between 3GPP
and non 3GPP accesses shall include mechanisms to minimize the handover
latency due to authentication and authorization for network access. This
applies to UEs either supporting simultaneous radio transmission capability or
not supporting it. EPS-based mobility between GERAN/UTRAN access and non-3GPP
access requires S4-based SGSNs.
For multiple PDN-GWs connecting to the same PDN, all the PDN GWs shall support
the same mobility protocols.
The EPC supports local breakout of traffic whether a roaming subscriber is
accessing the EPC via a 3GPP or a non 3GPP access network according to the
design principles described in clause 4.1 of TS 23.401 [4].
### 4.1.1 General Concepts for Interworking Between E-UTRAN and CDMA2000
The mobility management procedures specified to handle mobility between
E-UTRAN and CDMA2000 accesses (as required by TS 22.278 [20]) shall include
mechanisms to minimize the service interruption during handover and where
possible support bidirectional service continuity.
\- This applies to UEs supporting either single or dual radio capability.
\- The mobility management procedures should minimize any performance impacts
to the UE and the respective accesses, for example, UE battery consumption and
network throughput.
\- The mobility management procedures should minimize the coupling between the
different accesses allowing independent protocol evolution in each access.
### 4.1.2 General Concepts for Interworking Between 3GPP Accesses and WiMAX
The mobility management procedures specified to handle mobility between 3GPP
Accesses and WiMAX (as required by TS 22.278 [20]) shall include mechanisms to
minimize the service interruption during handover and where possible support
bidirectional service continuity.
\- This applies to UEs supporting either single or dual radio capability.
\- The mobility management procedures should minimize any performance impacts
to the UE and the respective accesses, for example, UE battery consumption and
network throughput.
\- The mobility management procedures should minimize the coupling between the
different accesses allowing independent protocol evolution in each access.
Furthermore, the mobility management procedures specified to handle mobility
between 3GPP accesses and WiMAX should minimize the impact on legacy systems
(i.e. UTRAN and GERAN).
### 4.1.3 IP Mobility Management Selection Principles
The Mobility mechanisms supported between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses within an
operator and its roaming partner\'s network would depend upon operator choice.
#### 4.1.3.1 Static Configuration of Inter-technology Mobility Mechanism
For networks deploying a single IP mobility management mechanism, the
statically configured mobility mechanism can be access type and/or roaming
agreement specific. The information about the mechanism to be used in such
scenario is expected to be provisioned into the terminal (or the UICC) and the
network. IP session continuity between 3GPP and non-3GPP access types may not
be provided in this case if there is a mismatch between what the UE expects
and what the network supports. For example service continuity may not be
possible if the user switches to a terminal supporting a different IP mobility
management mechanism than provisioned in the network.
NOTE: The mismatch case where a trusted non-3GPP network or ePDG only supports
DSMIPv6 and the UE does not, may lead to a situation where the UE receives a
local IP address in the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG, but gains no
PDN connectivity in the EPC. Depending on operator policy and roaming
agreements, IP connectivity may be provided using this local IP address to
access services (e.g. internet access) in the trusted non-3GPP network.
However, any such use of the local IP address where the user traffic does not
use the EPC is not described in this specification.
#### 4.1.3.2 Networks Supporting Multiple IP Mobility Mechanisms
IP Mobility management Selection (IPMS) consist of two components:
\- IP MM protocol selection between Network Based Mobility (NBM) and Host
based mobility (HBM - MIPv4 orDSMIPv6).
\- Decision on IP address preservation if NBM is selected.
IPMS does not relate to the selection between PMIPv6 and GTP over
S5/S8/S2b/S2a.
Upon initial attachment to a 3GPP access, no IPMS is necessary since
connectivity to a PDN GW is always established with a network-based mobility
mechanism.
Upon initial attachment to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG and upon handover
from 3GPP to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG, IPMS is performed before an IP
address is allocated and provided to the UE.
The UE support for a specific IP Mobility Management protocol and/or IP
address preservation mechanism for inter-access mobility may be known by the
network-based on explicit indication from the UE.
Upon attachment to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG, if the access network
(supporting at least NBM) is not aware of the UE capabilities and the home and
access network\'s policies allow the usage of NBM, then NBM is used for
establishing connectivity for the UE to the EPC.
When a NBM mechanism is used for establishing connectivity in the target
access upon inter-access mobility, IP address preservation for session
continuity based on NBM may take place as per PMIPv6 specification (RFC 5213
[8]) or according to clause 8.6 for GTP, and additionally based on the
knowledge in the network of UE\'s capability (if available) to support NBM.
Such knowledge may be based on an explicit indication from the UE upon
handover that IP address preservation based on NBM management can be provided.
IP address preservation for session continuity based on HBM may take place if
the network is aware of the UE capability to support DSMIPv6 or MIPv4. Such
knowledge may be based on an indication to the target trusted non-3GPP access
or ePDG from the HSS/AAA (e.g. in case of DSMIPv6, the UE performed S2c
bootstrap before moving to the target trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG). In
such a case, the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides the UE with
a new IP address, local to the access network if IP mobility management
protocol selected is DSMIPv6. In that case, in order to get IP address
preservation for session continuity, the UE shall use DSMIPv6 over S2c
reference point. This IP address shall be used as a care-of address for
DSMIPv6. If the IP mobility management protocol selected is MIPv4, the address
provided to the UE by the non-3GPP access network is a FACoA and IP address
preservation is performed over S2a using MIPv4 FACoA procedures.
The final decision on the mobility management mechanism is made by the HSS/AAA
upon UE authentication in the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG (both at
initial attachment and handover), based on the information it has regarding
the UE, local/home network capabilities and local/home network policies. If
the UE provided an explicit indication of the supported mobility mechanisms,
the network shall provide an indication to the UE identifying the selected
mobility management mechanism.
Support of different IP mobility management protocols at local/home network is
known by the AAA/HSS in one of the following ways:
\- through static pre-configuration, or
\- through indication of the supported IP mobility management protocols (NBM
and/or MIPv4 FA CoA mode) by the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG as
part of the AAA exchange for UE authentication.
Upon selecting a mobility management mechanism, as part of the AAA exchange
for UE authentication in the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG, the
HSS/AAA returns to the trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG an indication on
whether a local IP address shall be allocated to the UE, or if instead NBM
shall be used to establish the connectivity, or the HSS/AAA returns to the
trusted non-3GPP access system an indication that the address of the MIPv4
Foreign Agent shall be provided to the UE.
IPMS is performed in the following scenarios:
\- Upon initial attach to a trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG, the IPMS is
performed to decide how to establish IP connectivity for the UE.
\- Upon handover without optimization from a 3GPP access to a non-3GPP access,
the IPMS is performed to decide how to establish IP connectivity for the UE
over the trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG.
\- Upon change of access between a non-3GPP access and a 3GPP access or
between two non-3GPP accesses, if the IP MM protocol used to provide
connectivity to the UE over the trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG is a NBM
protocol, then a decision is performed on whether IP address preservation is
provided or not as per PMIPv6 specification, (RFC 5213 [8]) or according to
clause 8.6 for GTP and additionally based on the knowledge in the network of
UE\'s capability (if available) to support NBM.
##### 4.1.3.2.1 IP Mobility Management Selection During Initial Attach to a
Non-3GPP Access
The IPMS decision is performed as described in the following:
\- If the UE indicates DSMIPv6 support only, and the network supports and
selects DSMIPv6, the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides a local
IP address to the UE to be used as CoA for DSMIPv6/S2c.
\- If the UE indicates MIPv4 support only, and the network supports and
selects MIPv4, then the trusted non-3GPP access network provides a FACoA to
the UE.
\- If the UE indicates DSMIPv6 or MIPv4 support only, and the network selects
NBM for providing connectivity, then NBM is used for providing connectivity.
\- If the UE does not indicate any capabilities, it is assumed that the UE is
not able to support DSMIPv6 or MIPv4, and NBM is used for providing
connectivity if the network supports NBM.
#### 4.1.3.2.2 IPMS solutions
On handover to 3GPP access, UE shall request for IP address preservation by
setting Request Type flag to \"handover\" during the attach procedure.
NOTE: UE requests for address preservation if S2c is used over source access
network or MIPv4 FACoA is used to connect over source access network or UE is
capable of Network address preservation.
When the UE provides an indication of its supported mobility modes either
during initial attach or on handover, the UE provides such information to the
entity performing IPMS during network access authentication, for trusted
non-3GPP accesses, or during authentication for tunnel establishment with
ePDG, for untrusted non-3GPP accesses.
The network then makes the decision on what mobility protocol to be used for
connectivity as described in further clauses depending on the scenario.
##### 4.1.3.2.3 IP Mobility Management Selection on Handover between accesses
On handover to non-3GPP accesses, the IPMS decision is performed as described
in the following:
a. If the UE only indicates NBM support between the two access technologies
involved in the handover and the network supports NBM between those two access
technologies involved in the handover, then NBM is used for providing
connectivity, and IP address preservation is provided with S2a or S2b
procedures.
b. If the UE indicates DSMIPv6 support and the network supports and selects
DSMIPv6, the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides a local IP
address to the UE to be used as CoA for DSMIPv6, and IP address preservation
is provided with S2c procedures.
c. If the UE indicates DSMIPv6 support only and the network does not support
DSMIPv6, then NBM is used for providing basic connectivity to the existing PDN
GW if NBM is supported by the trusted non-3GPP access network or ePDG. In this
case, the decision for IP address preservation is made as per PMIPv6
specification, (RFC 5213 [8]) or according to clause 8.6 for GTP..
d. If the UE indicates support for both NBM and DSMIPv6, and the network based
on policies selects NBM to establish the connectivity, then NBM is used to
establish connectivity, and IP address preservation is provided with S2a or
S2b procedures.
e. If the UE indicates support for both NBM and DSMIPv6, and the network based
on policies selects DSMIPv6 to establish the connectivity, then the trusted
non-3GPP access network or ePDG provides a local IP address to the UE to be
used as CoA for DSMIPv6, and IP address preservation is provided with S2c
procedures.
f. If the UE does not indicate any capabilities, then NBM is used for
establishing connectivity if NBM is supported by the trusted non-3GPP access
network or ePDG. In this case, the decision for IP address preservation is
made as per PMIPv6 specification, (RFC 5213 [8]) or according to clause 8.6
for GTP..
NOTE 1: In case of bullet c and f, PMIPv6 specification allows two options:
a) Preserve the IP address based on a timer; If the connection through the old
access system is not torn down before the timer expires then a new prefix is
assigned, or
b) Immediately assign a new prefix.
This decision can be based on operator\'s policies.
NOTE 2: If prior to the handover, the UE was attached to a non-3GPP access
with DSMIPv6, bullets a. and c. are considered not to apply.
NOTE 3: The PDN GW capability of supporting NBM or DSMIPv6 or MIPv4 should be
considered in IP Mobility Mode Selection.
The UE indication of DSMIPv6 support may be implicit, e.g. having bootstrapped
a security association via the old access network. The same applies to NBM,
since the network can collect information about NBM support from other
sources.
On handover to 3GPP access, the only decision that needs to be made is whether
IP address preservation needs to be provided or not.
### 4.1.4 Trusted/untrusted non-3GPP access network detection
During initial attach or handover attach a UE needs to discover the trust
relationship (whether it is a Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Network) of
the non-3GPP access network in order to know which non-3GPP IP access
procedure to initiate. The trust relationship of a non-3GPP access network is
made known to the UE with one of the following options:
1) If the non-3GPP access supports 3GPP-based access authentication, the UE
discovers the trust relationship during the 3GPP-based access authentication.
2) The UE operates on the basis of pre-configured policy in the UE.
### 4.1.5 Non-seamless WLAN offload
Non-seamless WLAN offload is an optional capability of a UE supporting WLAN
radio access in addition to 3GPP radio access.
A UE supporting non-seamless WLAN offload may, while connected to WLAN access,
route specific IP flows via the WLAN access without traversing the EPC. These
IP flows are identified via user preferences, the Local Operating Environment
Information defined in TS 23.261 [55], and via policies that may be statically
pre-configured by the operator on the UE, or dynamically set by the operator
via the ANDSF. For such IP flows the UE uses the local IP address allocated by
the WLAN access network and no IP address preservation is provided between
WLAN and 3GPP accesses.
For performing the non-seamless WLAN offload, the UE needs to acquire a local
IP address on WLAN access, and it is not required to connect to an ePDG.
Also, in the case the WLAN access is EPC connected, it is possible for a UE
which also supports seamless WLAN offload to perfom seamless WLAN offload for
some IP flows and non seamless WLAN offload for some other IP flows
simultaneously.

\- Gxc is used only in the case of PMIP variant of S5 or S8.
\- Gxa is used when the Trusted non-3GPP Access network is owned by the same
operator.
\- Gxb is used only in the case of PMIP variant of S2b.
\- S9 is used instead of Gxa to the Trusted non-3GPP Access network not owned
by the same operator.
\- Gxa or S9 are terminated in the Trusted non-3GPP Accesses if supported.
\- S2c is used only for DSMIPv6 bootstrapping and DSMIPv6 De-Registration
(Binding Update with Lifetime equals zero) when the UE is connected via 3GPP
access. Dashed lines are used in Figure 4.2.2-2, Figure 4.2.3-3 and Figure
4.2.3-5 to indicate this case.

## 4.3 Network Elements
### 4.3.1 Access Networks
#### 4.3.1.1 E-UTRAN
E-UTRAN is described in detail in TS 36.300 [6] with additional functions
listed in TS 23.401 [4].
#### 4.3.1.2 Trusted and Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Network
Trusted and Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Networks are IP access networks that use
access technology whose specification is out of the scope of 3GPP.
Whether a Non-3GPP IP access network is Trusted or Untrusted is not a
characteristic of the access network.
In non-roaming scenario it is the HPLMN\'s operator decision if a Non-3GPP IP
access network is used as Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Network.
In roaming scenario, the HSS/3GPP AAA Server in HPLMN makes the final decision
of whether a Non-3GPP IP access network is used as Trusted or Untrusted
non-3GPP Access Network. The HSS/3GPP AAA Server may take the VPLMN\'s policy
and capability returned from the 3GPP AAA Proxy or roaming agreement into
account.
For supporting multiple PDNs, the same trust relationship shall apply to all
the PDNs the UE connects to from a certain Non-3GPP Access Network, i.e. it
shall not be possible to access one PDN using the non-3GPP access network as
Trusted, while access to another PDN using the same non-3GPP access network as
Untrusted.
### 4.3.2 MME
The details of functionality of MME are described TS 23.401 [4].
The following are additional MME functions:
\- HRPD access node (terminating S101 reference point) selection and
maintenance for handovers to HRPD;
\- Transparent transfer of HRPD signalling messages and transfer of status
information between E-UTRAN and HRPD access, as specified in the pre-
registration and handover flows.
\- Forwarding the GRE key for uplink traffic to the target S‑GW in case of CN
node relocation.
### 4.3.3 Gateway
#### 4.3.3.1 General
Two logical Gateways exist:
\- Serving GW (S‑GW)
\- PDN GW (P‑GW)
The functional split of PDN GW and Serving GW is described in TS 23.401 [4].
#### 4.3.3.2 Serving GW
The functionality of the Serving GW is described in TS 23.401 [4]. In addition
to the functions described in TS 23.401 [4] the Serving GW includes the
following functionality:
\- A local non-3GPP anchor for the case of roaming when the non-3GPP IP
accesses connected to the VPLMN.
\- Event reporting (change of RAT, etc.) to the PCRF.
\- Uplink and downlink bearer binding towards 3GPP accesses as defined in TS
23.203 [19].
\- Uplink bearer binding verification with packet dropping of \"misbehaving UL
traffic\".
NOTE 1: The term \'Uplink bearer binding verification\' is defined in TS
23.401 [4].
\- Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) according to PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213
[8], if PMIP-based S5 or S8 is used. The MAG function shall be able to send UL
packets before sending the PBU or before receiving the PBA.
\- Decide if packets are to be forwarded (uplink towards PDN or downlink
towards UE) or if they are locally destined to the S‑GW (e.g. Router
Solicitation).
\- DHCPv4 (relay agent) and DHCPv6 (relay agent) functions if PMIP-based S5 or
S8 is used.
\- Handling of Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement messages as
defined in RFC 4861 [38], if PMIP based S5 and S8 is used.
\- Handling of Neighbour Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages as
defined in RFC 4861 [38], if PMIP based S5 and S8 is used.
\- Allocation of downlink GRE key for each PDN connection within the Serving
GW, which is used by the PDN GW to encapsulate downlink traffic to the Serving
GW on the PMIP-based S5/S8 interface.
\- If PMIP-based S8-S2a/b chaining is used:
\- the Serving GW acts as a LMA towards the MAG function of the Trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access or the ePDG;
\- the Serving GW allocates uplink GRE key for each PDN connection within the
Serving GW, which is used to encapsulate uplink traffic on PMIPv6-based
S2a/S2b interface.
NOTE 2: The Serving GW does not require full MAG and full LMA functionally.
\- the Serving GW includes functionality to interwork the PMIPv6 signalling
towards the PDN GW and PMIPv6 signalling towards the MAG function of the
Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or the ePDG. In this case the Serving GW also acts
as a MAG towards the PDN GW;
\- the Serving GW includes functionality to link the user-plane of the PMIPv6
tunnel towards the PDN GW and the user-plane of the PMIPv6 tunnel towards the
MAG function of the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or the ePDG.
#### 4.3.3.3 PDN GW
PDN GW functionality is described in TS 23.401 [4] for 3GPP accesses connected
to the EPC via GTP-based and PMIP-based S5/S8 interface. The PDN GW supports
functionality specified in TS 23.401 [4] that is common to both PMIP-based and
GTP-based S5/S8 interfaces also for access to EPC via non-3GPP accesses.
Additionally, the PDN GW is the user plane anchor for mobility between 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access. For this, the PDN GW includes the following
functionality:
\- A LMA according to the PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8], if PMIP-based S5
or S8, or if PMIP-based S2a or PMIP-based S2b is used. The LMA function shall
be able to accept UL packets from any trusted MAG without enforcing that the
source IP address must match the CoA in the MN BCE.
\- A DSMIPv6 Home Agent, as described in RFC 5555 [10], if S2c is used.
\- Allocation of uplink GRE key for each PDN connection within the PDN GW,
which is used to encapsulate uplink traffic to the PDN GW on the PMIP-based
S5/S8, or PMIP-based S2a or PMIP based S2b interface.
\- A MIPV4 Home Agent, if S2a with MIPv4 FA CoA mode is used.
\- GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the control plane and the user plane to
provide PDN connectivity to UEs using non-3GPP accesses, if GTP-based S2a or
GTP-based S2b is used.
### 4.3.4 ePDG
The functionality of ePDG includes the following:
\- Functionality defined for the PDG in TS 23.234 [5] for the allocation of a
remote IP address as an IP address local to the ePDG which is used as CoA when
S2c is used;
\- Functionality for transportation of a remote IP address as an IP address
specific to a PDN when S2b is used;
\- Routing of packets from/to PDN GW (and from/to Serving GW if it is used as
local anchor in VPLMN) to/from UE; if GTP based S2b is used, this includes
routing of uplink packets based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs
assigned to the S2b bearers of the PDN connection;
\- Routing of downlink packets towards the SWu instance associated to the PDN
connection;
\- De-capsulation/Encapsulation of packets for IPSec and, if network based
mobility (S2b) is used, for GTP or PMIPv6 tunnels;
\- Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) according to the PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213
[8], if PMIP based S2b is used;
\- Tunnel authentication and authorization (termination of IKEv2 signalling
and relay via AAA messages);
\- Local mobility anchor within untrusted non-3GPP access networks using
MOBIKE (if needed);
\- Transport level packet marking in the uplink;
\- Enforcement of QoS policies based on information received via AAA
infrastructure;
\- Lawful Interception.
\- Allocation of downlink GRE key for each PDN connection within the ePDG,
which is used to encapsulate downlink traffic to the ePDG on the PMIPv6-based
S2b interface.
\- Accounting for inter-operator charging according to charging principles
specified in TS 32.240 [61].
\- Interfacing OFCS through reference points TS 32.251 [62] for EPC nodes.
### 4.3.5 PCRF
The functionality of PCRF is described in TS 23.203 [19] with additional
functionality listed in TS 23.401 [4]. In the non-roaming scenario,
additionally, the PCRF terminates the Gxa, Gxb and Gxc reference points with
the appropriate IP-CANs.
In roaming scenarios, the difference from TS 23.401 [4], is that the vPCRF
exists for the UE for the scenario of roaming with home-routed traffic in
addition to the scenario in TS 23.401 [4] of roaming with local breakout.
#### 4.3.5.1 Home PCRF
In addition to the h-PCRF functionality listed in TS 23.401 [4], in this
document the Home PCRF
\- Terminates the Gx reference point for roaming with home routed traffic;
\- Terminates the Gxa, Gxb or Gxc/S9 reference points as appropriate for the
IP-CAN type.
#### 4.3.5.2 Visited PCRF
In addition to the v-PCRF functionality listed in TS 23.401 [4], in this
document the Visited PCRF
\- Terminates the Gxa, Gxb or Gxc reference points as appropriate for the IP-
CAN type;
\- Terminates the S9 reference point.
## 4.4 Reference Points
### 4.4.1 List of Reference Points
The description of the reference points:
S1-MME, S1-U, S3, S4, S10, S11: these are defined in TS 23.401 [4].
**S2a** It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between trusted non 3GPP IP access and the Gateway.
**S2b** It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between ePDG and the Gateway.
**S2c** It provides the user plane with related control and mobility support
between UE and the Gateway. This reference point is implemented over trusted
and/or untrusted non-3GPP Access and/or 3GPP access.
**S5** It provides user plane tunnelling and tunnel management between Serving
GW and PDN GW. It is used for Serving GW relocation due to UE mobility and in
case the Serving GW needs to connect to a non collocated PDN GW for the
required PDN connectivity.
**S6a** This interface is defined between MME and HSS for authentication and
authorization. It is defined in TS 23.401 [4].
**S6b** It is the reference point between PDN Gateway and 3GPP AAA
server/proxy for mobility related authentication if needed. This reference
point may also be used to retrieve and request storage of mobility parameters.
This reference point may also be used to retrieve static QoS profile for a UE
for non-3GPP access in case dynamic PCC is not supported.
**Gx** It provides transfer of (QoS) policy and charging rules from PCRF to
Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) in the PDN GW.
**Gxa** It provides transfer of (QoS) policy information from PCRF to the
Trusted Non-3GPP accesses.
**Gxb** This interface is not specified within this Release of the
specification.
**Gxc** It provides transfer of (QoS) policy information from PCRF to the
Serving Gateway
**PMIP-based S8** It is the roaming interface in case of roaming with home
routed traffic. It provides the user plane with related control between
Gateways in the VPLMN and HPLMN.
**S9** It provides transfer of (QoS) policy and charging control information
between the Home PCRF and the Visited PCRF in order to support local breakout
function. In all other roaming scenarios, S9 has functionality to provide
dynamic QoS control policies from the HPLMN.
**SGi** It is the reference point between the PDN Gateway and the packet data
network. Packet data network may be an operator external public or private
packet data network or an intra operator packet data network, e.g. for
provision of IMS services. This reference point corresponds to Gi and Wi
functionalities and supports any 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems.
**SWa** It connects the Untrusted non-3GPP IP Access with the 3GPP AAA
Server/Proxy and transports access authentication, authorization and charging-
related information in a secure manner.
**STa** It connects the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access with the 3GPP AAA
Server/Proxy and transports access authentication, authorization, mobility
parameters and charging-related information in a secure manner.
**SWd** It connects the 3GPP AAA Proxy, possibly via intermediate networks, to
the 3GPP AAA Server.
**SWm** This reference point is located between 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy and ePDG
and is used for AAA signalling (transport of mobility parameters, tunnel
authentication and authorization data). This reference point also includes the
MAG-AAA interface functionality, RFC 5779 [43] and Mobile IPv6 NAS-AAA
interface functionality, RFC 5447 [44].
**SWn** This is the reference point between the Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access
and the ePDG. Traffic on this interface for a UE-initiated tunnel has to be
forced towards ePDG. This reference point has the same functionality as Wn
which is defined in TS 23.234 [5].
**SWu** This is the reference point between the UE and the ePDG and supports
handling of IPSec tunnels. The functionality of SWu includes UE-initiated
tunnel establishment, user data packet transmission within the IPSec tunnel
and tear down of the tunnel and support for fast update of IPSec tunnels
during handover between two untrusted non-3GPP IP accesses.
**SWx** This reference point is located between 3GPP AAA Server and HSS and is
used for transport of authentication, subscription and PDN connection related
data.
S1 interface for E-UTRAN is the same for both the architectures.
Protocol assumption:
\- S2a interface is based on current or future IETF RFCs. S2a is based on
Proxy Mobile IP version 6. For Trusted WLAN, S2a may also be based on GTP. To
enable access via Trusted Non 3GPP IP accesses that do not support GTP and
PMIPv6, S2a also supports Client Mobile IPv4 FA mode.
\- S2b interface is based on GTP or Proxy Mobile IP version 6.
\- S2c is based on DSMIPv6 [10].
\- The PMIP-based S5, PMIP-based S8, PMIP-based S2a and PMIP-based S2b
interfaces are based on the same protocols and differences shall be minimized.
The S5 interface is based on the PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8].
\- The GTP-based S5/S8, GTP-based S2a and GTP based S2b interfaces are based
on the GTP protocol (TS 29.274 [57]). The GTP variant of S5 interface is
described in TS 23.401 [4].
\- PMIPv6-based S8 interface is based on the PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213
[8]. The GTP variant interface is described in TS 23.401 [4].
\- The PMIPv6-based interfaces (S5, S8, S2a, and S2b) shall support Generic
Routing Encapsulation (GRE) RFC 2784 [23] including the Key field extension
RFC 2890 [24]. The Key field value of each GRE packet header should enable the
unique identification of the UE PDN connection that the GRE packet payload is
associated with. These keys are exchanged using GRE Options extension to
PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Ack messages on PMIPv6-based
interfaces.
\- In case of CN node relocation, the GRE key for uplink traffic is forwarded
to the target S‑GW over S10/S11 reference point.
\- SWu interface is based on IKEv2 [9] and MOBIKE [18].
The EPS shall allow the operator to configure a type of access (3GPP or
non-3GPP) as the \"home link\" for Client Mobile IP purposes.
NOTE: Redundancy support on reference points PMIP-based S5 and PMIP-based S8
should be taken into account.
### 4.4.2 Reference Point Requirements
#### 4.4.2.1 S5 Reference Point Requirements
Both the GTP and PMIP variants of the S5 reference point shall satisfy the
following architectural principles:
\- There shall be only one radio interface protocol stack defined, common for
both S5 variants, including both radio layer and Non-Access Stratum protocols.
\- There shall be only one S6a interface defined common to both S5 variants.
There may be a need for different information elements specific to PMIP-based
or GTP-based variants of S5 but differences due to the S5 variants should be
minimized.
\- In the non-roaming case, there shall be only one Gx interface defined for
transfer of policy and charging rules, common to both S5 variants. There may
be a need for different information elements specific to PMIP-based or GTP-
based variants of S5 but differences due to the S5 variants should be
minimized.
\- Differences between S5 variants in terms of functional split between the
endpoints should be minimized.
The S5 reference point shall fulfil the following requirements:
\- S5 shall allow access to multiple PDNs. It shall be possible to allow an UE
to connect to different packet data networks. It shall also be possible to
support a UE with concurrent connections to several packet data networks.
\- S5 shall allow multiple PDN connections for a given APN and UE.
\- S5 shall be able to transport both IPv4 and IPv6 user plane traffic
independent of IP version of the underlying IP transport network.
\- S5 shall support fault handling. There should be mechanisms to identify and
signal faults for groups of mobiles -- e.g., if a large node handling millions
of terminals goes down.
NOTE: As further development of the architecture takes place as well as when
additional functionality such as MBMS, LCS etc. are addressed, further
requirements will be needed.

## 4.5 High Level Functions
### 4.5.1 PDN GW Selection Function for Non-3GPP Accesses for S2a and S2b
PDN Gateway selection for non-3GPP accesses uses similar mechanisms as defined
in TS 23.401 [4], with the following modification:
\- The PDN Gateway selection function interacts with the 3GPP AAA Server or
3GPP AAA Proxy and uses subscriber information provided by the HSS to the 3GPP
AAA Server. To support separate PDN GW addresses at a PDN GW for different
mobility protocols (PMIP, MIPv4 or GTP), the PDN GW Selection function takes
mobility protocol type into account when deriving PDN GW address by using the
Domain Name Service function.
During the initial authorization, PDN Gateway selection information for each
of the subscribed PDNs is returned to the ePDG or the Trusted Non-3GPP Access
Network. The PDN Gateway selection information includes:
\- The PDN GW identity, which is a logical name (FQDN) or IP address and an
APN; or
\- an APN and an indication whether the allocation of a PDN GW from the
visited PLMN is allowed or a PDN GW from the home PLMN shall be allocated.
This enables the entity requiring the IP address of the PDN Gateway to proceed
with selection as per the procedures defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 4.3.8.1.
Once the selection has occurred, the PDN Gateway registers its association
with a UE and the APN with the AAA/HSS by sending PDN GW identity, that is
either its IP address (e.g. if it has a single IP address for all the mobility
protocols it supports or if it only supports one mobility protocol) or its
FQDN (e.g. if it has multiple IP addresses for the mobility protocols it
supports), as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW
is located, to the 3GPP AAA Server or AAA Proxy only when the Access
Technology Type is non-3GPP. For 3GPP access types, the MME/S4-SGSN updates
the HSS with the selected PDN GW identity, as well as information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located, according to TS 23.401
[4]/TS 23.060 [21]. This permits the HSS and 3GPP AAA Server or Proxy to
provide the association of the PDN Gateway identity and the related APN for
the UE subsequently.
NOTE 1: The format of the information that identifies the PLMN in which the
PDN GW is located is defined in stage 3 specifications.
In the case that a UE already has assigned PDN Gateway(s), the PDN GW identity
for each of the already allocated PDN Gateway(s), as well as information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located, are returned by the 3GPP
AAA Server or Proxy during the authorization step. This eliminates the need to
repeat PDN Gateway selection for the PDNs the UE is already connected with.
The information about the PLMN in which the PGW is located allows the
receiving entity to determine an appropriate APN-OI. The ePDG may use this
information to determine the S2b protocol type (PMIP or GTP). The TWAN may
also use this information to determine the S2a protocol type (PMIP or GTP).
Upon mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, PDN Gateway selection
information for the subscribed PDNs the UE is not yet connected with is
returned to the target access system as done during initial attachment. For
the PDNs the UE is already connected with transfer of PDN GW information takes
place as defined below:
\- If a UE attaches to a non-3GPP access and it already has assigned PDN
Gateway(s) due to a previous attach in a 3GPP access, the HSS provides the PDN
GW identity, as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN
GW is located, for each of the already allocated PDN Gateway(s) with the
corresponding PDN information to the 3GPP AAA server over the SWx reference
point.
\- If a UE attaches to a 3GPP access and it already has an assigned PDN
Gateway(s) due to a previous attach in a non-3GPP access, the HSS provides the
PDN GW identity, as well as information that identifies the PLMN in which the
PDN GW is located, for each of the already allocated PDN Gateway(s) with the
corresponding PDN information to the MME over the S6a reference point and/or
S4-SGSN over the S6d reference point.
The HSS receives the PDN GW identity for each of the selected PDN GWs and the
corresponding PDN information for a given UE, from both the 3GPP AAA Server
and also from the MME/S4-SGSN, depending on the currently in-use access. The
HSS is responsible for the storage of the selected PDN GW identity as
described in clause 12.
The ePDG may be configured with the S2b protocol variant(s) on a per HPLMN
granularity, or may retrieve information regarding the S2b protocol variants
supported by the PDN GW (PMIP or/and GTP) from the Domain Name Service
function.
The TWAN may be configured with the S2a protocol variant(s) on a per HPLMN
granularity, or may retrieve information regarding the S2a protocol variants
supported by the PDN GW (PMIP or/and GTP) from the Domain Name Service
function.
NOTE 2: The location of the PDN GW selection function depends upon the type of
S2 interface used for attachment and the IP mobility mechanism being used.
\- For PMIPv6 on S2a/b, the entity requesting the PDN Gateway is the entity
acting as Mobile Access Gateway (MAG).
\- For GTP on S2b, the entity requesting the PDN Gateway is the ePDG.
\- For GTP on S2a, the TWAG, described in clause 16.1.2, is requesting the PDN
Gateway.
\- For the PMIP-based S8-S2a/b chained cases, the PDN GW information is sent
together with the selected Serving GW address from the 3GPP AAA proxy to the
entity acting as MAG in the non-3GPP access network during access
authentication and authorization. The PDN GW selection mechanism is the same
as in the unchained case. The MAG function of the non-3GPP access network
conveys the PDN GW address to the Serving GW as part of the PMIPv6 PBU
message.
\- For MIPv4 FA mode on S2a, the entity requesting the PDN Gateway is the
entity that plays the role of the FA.
### 4.5.1a PDN GW Selection Function for eHRPD with SIPTO support
In order to select the appropriate PDN GW for SIPTO in eHRPD access via HSGW,
the PDN GW selection function needs to support DNS mechanism that allows
selection of a PDN GW which is close to the HSGW for the UE. Details related
to SIPTO support for eHRPD access is defined in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [51].
### 4.5.2 PDN GW Selection Function for S2c
For the S2c reference point, the UE needs to know the IP address of the PDN
Gateway for the PDN the UE wants to connect to. This address is made known to
the UE using one of the following methods:
1) Via PCO at the attach procedure or UE requested PDN Connectivity procedure,
for 3GPP access (as defined in TS 23.401 [4]) or trusted non-3GPP access (if
supported).
2) Via IKEv2 during tunnel setup to ePDG. For a UE\'s initial Attach, during
the IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure on the SWu interface (between UE and
ePDG):
\- For non-roaming case, the 3GPP AAA Server selects the HA (PDN GW) which is
close to the ePDG and sends the HA (PDN GW) FQDN or IP address to the ePDG;
\- For roaming with local breakout case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy selects the HA
(PDN GW) which is close to the ePDG and sends the HA (PDN GW) FQDN or IP
address to the ePDG;
The HA (PDN GW) FQDN or IP address are then forwarded to the UE by the ePDG.
NOTE 1: Whether the selected PDN GW is closer to the UE than other PDN GW
depends on the network configurations and operations, it may be
geographically/topologically closer or less IP hops.
3) If the IP address of the PDN GW is not received using options 1-2 above and
if the UE knows that the HA is in the PDN where the UE is attached to then the
UE shall request a PDN Gateway address via DHCP IETF RFC 6611 [41].
4) If the IP address of the PDN GW is not delivered using options 1-3 above
the UE can interact directly with the Domain Name Service function by
composing a FQDN corresponding to the PDN.
For the S2c reference point, the network can force a reallocation of the PDN
Gateway selected upon initial DSMIPv6 bootstrapping for the PDN the UE wants
to connect to. This may happen if one of the following situations occurs:
\- The UE has done initial network attachment on an access system supporting
network-based mobility, but the PDN Gateway discovered by the UE for the S2c
reference point is different from the PDN Gateway allocated at initial network
attachment. In this case, to enable IP address preservation based on DSMIPv6
upon inter-system mobility, the network must trigger a PDN Gateway
reallocation for the S2c reference point, to re-direct the UE to the PDN
Gateway that was selected upon initial network attachment.
\- The UE has done initial network attachment over S2c and, relying on DNS,
has discovered a sub-optimal PDN Gateway. In this case, based on operator\'s
policies, the network can optionally trigger a PDN Gateway reallocation to re-
redirect the UE to a PDN Gateway that can provide better performance.
PDN Gateway reallocation for the S2c reference point is triggered by the
AAA/HSS during DSMIPv6 bootstrapping. For a UE\'s initial Attach, if the UE
has selected a initial PDN GW and initiated DSMIPv6 bootstrapping:
\- In non-roaming scenario, the PDN GW reports the UE Care of Address
(allocated by the WLAN AN or ePDG) to the 3GPP AAA Server. According to the UE
CoA and the pre-configuration, the 3GPP AAA Server finds there are other PDN
GW(s) which are close to the UE, then it can initiate a PDN GW reallocation
procedure (Clause 6.10 \"PDN GW reallocation upon attach on S2c\") to redirect
the UE to the other PDN GW.
\- In roaming with local breakout scenario, the PDN GW reports the UE Care of
Address (allocated by the WLAN AN or ePDG) to the 3GPP AAA Proxy. According to
the UE CoA and the pre-configuration, the 3GPP AAA Proxy finds there are other
PDN GW(s) which are close to the UE, then it can initiate a PDN GW
reallocation procedure (clause 6.10 \"PDN GW reallocation upon attach on
S2c\") to redirect the UE to the other PDN GW.
NOTE 2: Whether the selected PDN GW is closer to the UE than other PDN GW
depends on the network configurations and operations, it may be
geographically/topologically closer or less IP hops.
NOTE 3: This reallocation is initiated only if the UE has not yet successfully
established a binding with the selected PDN GW.
The HSS receives the values of identity(ies) of all allocated PDN GWs and the
corresponding PDN information for a given UE from the 3GPP AAA. The HSS is
responsible for the storage of PDN GW identity information.
### 4.5.3 Serving GW Selection Function for Non-3GPP Accesses
The S‑GW selection function allocates an S‑GW that acts as a local anchor for
non-3GPP access in the case of S8-S2a/b chained roaming. Whether S8-S2a/b
chaining should be used is decided by 3GPP AAA Proxy based on per-HPLMN
configuration.
The Serving GW selection function is located in 3GPP AAA Proxy. If an S‑GW is
needed for non-3GPP access in the visited network, the 3GPP AAA proxy will
select an S‑GW for the UE during initial attach or handover attach. The 3GPP
AAA proxy shall send the selected S‑GW address to the MAG function of the
Trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG in the chained S8-S2a/b scenarios.
There is no mechanism standardized for S‑GW address preservation for handover
between 3GPP and non-3GPP in S2/S8 chained case within this Release of the
specification.
### 4.5.4 ePDG Selection
The UE may select the ePDG by static configuration or dynamically.
NOTE: If a selected ePDG is not reachable from an untrusted non-3GPP access
the UE repeats the ePDG selection and selects a different ePDG if available.
If the ePDG needs to be dynamically selected when the UE roams in a VPLMN
which VPLMN ID is known by the UE, the procedure is as follows:
\- The UE constructs an FQDN using the VPLMN ID as the Operator Identifier and
employs the DNS server function to obtain the IP address(es) of the ePDG(s) in
the VPLMN.
\- The UE selects an ePDG address from the list returned in the DNS response
and initiates the IPsec tunnel establishment.
Otherwise if the ePDG needs to be dynamically selected the procedure is as
follows:
\- The UE constructs an FQDN using the HPLMN ID and employs the DNS server
function to obtain the IP address(es) of the ePDG(s).
\- The UE selects an ePDG address from the list returned in the DNS response
and initiates the IPsec tunnel establishment.
A UE connected to one or multiple PDN GWs uses a single ePDG. In case of
handover between ePDGs, the UE may be temporarily connected to two ePDGs.
### 4.5.5 PCRF Selection
In addition to the PDN-GW and AF being served by one or more PCRF nodes in a
HPLMN and, where applicable , in VPLMN as in TS 23.401 [4], the following
nodes in this specification also are served by PCRF:
\- Serving GW;
\- Elements in trusted non-3gpp access;
\- ePDG.
Selection of a PCRF by nodes served by PCRF in this specification, is the same
as that in specified in TS 23.203 [19].
### 4.5.6 DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function
The DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function is used by the UE to detect if, for a
specific PDN, an access interface is the Home Link from a DSMIPv6 perspective.
It is up to the UE configuration to decide when to trigger the home link
detection function for a specific PDN connection, except that homelink
detection for an access interface shall be performed before sending any
DSMIPv6 Binding Update via that access interface.
The UE detects the home link comparing the IPv6 prefix associated with a
specific access system of the UE , and the Home Network Prefix (HNP)
associated with the PDN connection. If there is a match, the UE detects it is
in the home link for this specific PDN over the access interface. Otherwise,
the UE detects it is not in the home link for this specific PDN over the
access interface.
Home Network Prefix (HNP) may be assigned in a 3GPP access via PCO during 3GPP
attach, if supported by the UE, or via IKEv2.
NOTE: The UE knows the IPv6 prefix associated with a specific access system
interface via IP address allocation mechanisms applied in that access system.
The UE knows the HNP associated with a specific PDN from the IPsec security
association bootstrap (see clause 6.3, step 4) or from PCO received in 3GPP
attach.
### 4.5.7 IMS Emergency Session Support
Support for IMS Emergency Session for E-UTRAN access connected to the EPC with
GTP-based S5/S8 is covered in TS 23.401 [4]. Corresponding changes that apply
for PMIP-based S5/S8 interface are covered in clause 5 of this specification.
For this Release of the specification, IMS Emergency Session Support for
non-3GPP accesses connected to EPC is limited to support of handover of
emergency sessions from E‑UTRAN access to HRPD access and is covered in clause
9 of this specification with an overview provided in clause 9.2.2.
NOTE: Support for IMS emergency sessions over HRPD access connected to EPC is
not covered in this specification.
## 4.6 Identities
### 4.6.1 User Identification
In order to access the 3GPP Evolved Packet Core from non-3GPP accesses, and
get Authentication, Authorization and Accounting services from the Evolved
Packet Core, the NAI RFC 4282 [15] based user identification defined in TS
23.003 [16] shall be used.
In order to support network-based and client-based mobility related services
from the evolved packet core, the NAI RFC 4282 [15] based user identification
as defined in TS 23.003 [16] shall be used by the network and mobility
clients. The username part of NAI shall be based on IMSI. For emergency
attached UEs to the HRPD access which do not have authenticated IMSI, the
username part of the MN NAI shall be based on IMEI as defined in TS 23.003
[16] for S2a and S101 reference points (see clause 9). IMSI shall be used for
user identification on the GTP based S2b interface.
User identification in non-3GPP accesses may require additional identities
that are out of the scope of 3GPP. These user identities, if not compliant to
TS 23.003 [16], are however not sufficient to identify a user in the 3GPP
Evolved Packet Core.
### 4.6.2 EPS bearer identity with GTP based S2b/S2a
With GTP based S2b an EPS Bearer ID uniquely identifies an S2b bearer between
an ePDG and a PDN GW for one UE accessing via non 3GPP access (see clause
4.10.3). This EPS Bearer ID is allocated by the ePDG and is not known to the
UE.
With GTP based S2a an EPS Bearer ID uniquely identifies an S2a bearer between
a TWAN and a PDN GW for one UE accessing via trusted WLAN access. This EPS
Bearer ID is allocated by the TWAN and is not known to the UE.
The EPS Bearer IDs assigned for a specific UE on S2b are independent of the
EPS Bearer IDs assigned for the same UE on S5/S8 and may overlap in value.
The EPS Bearer IDs assigned for a specific UE on S2a are independent of the
EPS Bearer IDs assigned for the same UE on S5/S8 and may overlap in value.
NOTE 1: In MAPCON scenario with one PDN connection over 3GPP access and
another PDN connection over untrusted non-3GPP access, the possibly identical
EPS Bearer ID used simultaneously on S2b and S5/S8 designates two distinct
traffic flow aggregates.
NOTE 2: When a PDN connection is handed over between 3GPP access and untrusted
non-3GPP access, the possibly identical EPS Bearer ID on the source and target
side may designate distinct traffic flow aggregates.
## 4.7 IP Address Allocation
### 4.7.1 IP Address Allocation with PMIP-based S5/S8
The IP address allocation mechanisms described in clause 5.3.1.1 of TS 23.401
[4] are also valid for the PMIP based S5/S8. This clause is complementary to
clause 5.3.1 of TS 23.401 [4] and describes the differences in the IP Address
allocation when PMIP-based S5/S8 is used.
For IP address allocation with PMIP-based S5/S8, the following clarifications
apply:
\- If the PDN Type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4:
\- If initial and handover attach and deferred IPv4 address allocation is not
used, the IPv4 address is allocated via default bearer activation. This case
does not present any architecture differences from the GTP based S5/S8
described in clause 5.3.1.2.1 of TS 23.401 [4]. In this case, the Serving GW
shall request IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update. Then the IPv4 address
is assigned by the PDN GW and returned to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy
Binding Acknowledgement.
\- If initial and handover attach and deferred IPv4 address allocation is
used, the IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4
according to RFC 2131 [28] and RFC 4039 [29] procedure does not present any
architecture differences from the GTP based S5/S8 described in TS 23.401 [4],
clause 5.3.1.2.4, except that the Serving GW shall have DHCPv4 relay agent
functionality. The Serving GW shall request IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding
Update. Then the IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW and returned to the
Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The PDN GW shall also
send the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the same Proxy
Binding Acknowledgement message. In this case, the UE IPv4 address assigned by
the PDN GW is not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures
to the UE. The Serving GW replaces the IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW to
0.0.0.0 in the response message to the MME. The MME then forwards the 0.0.0.0
address to the UE. After the default bearer establishment procedure is
completed, the UE uses the connectivity with the EPS and initiates the IPv4
address allocation on its own using DHCPv4 as specified in figure 4.7.1-1. The
IPv4 address provided to the UE by DHCPv4 procedure shall correspond to the
value provided in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.
\- If the IPv4 address is allocated by using DHCPv4 procedure, then at any
time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or the IPv4 address
lease time expires, the PDN GW initiates the \"PDN-GW initiated PDN-
disconnection\" procedure for the given PDN connection. The same IPv4 address
shall not be allocated to another UE immediately.
\- If the PDN Type associated with the PDN connection is IPv6:
\- IPv6 network prefix allocation via IPv6 Stateless Address auto-
configuration: The IPv6 network prefix is assigned by the PDN GW and returned
to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The Serving GW
shall advertise the same information as the PDN GW would advertise with GTP
based S5/S8. To ensure that link-local address generated by the UE does not
collide with the link-local address of the Serving GW, the PDN GW shall
provide an interface identifier to the UE and the UE shall use this interface
identifier to configure its link-local address. For stateless address auto-
configuration however, the UE can choose any interface identifier to generate
IPv6 address, other than link-local, without involving the network. The PDN GW
shall also provide a link-local address to the Serving GW and the Serving GW
shall use the link-local address on the access link shared with the UE. In the
case of PMIP-S5/S8 because any prefix that the Serving GW will advertise to
the UE is unique, there is no need for the UE to perform Duplicate Address
Detection for global uniqueness for any IPv6 address configured from the
allocated IPv6 network prefix. However, the Serving GW shall respond with
Neighbor Advertisement upon receiving Neighbor Solicitation messages from a
given UE. For example, the UE may perform Neighbor Unreachability Detection
towards the Serving GW, the Serving GW supports the DAD related functionality
similar to that supported by PDN GW in the case of GTP based S5/S8 described
in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.2. Otherwise the PDN GW has the same
functions as it is defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.2.
\- IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6 procedure does not
present any architecture differences from the GTP based S5/S8 described in TS
23.401 [4], clause 5.3.1.2.3, except that the Serving GW shall have DHCPv6
relay agent functionality. The P-GW notifies the UE with the same DNSv6
information as was provided via PCO during the PDN connection establishment
procedure, e.g. Attach, if DHCPv6 procedure is performed by the UE.
\- If sent, the router solicitation from the UE comes subsequent to the Attach
procedure, as shown in Figure 4.7.1-2. The IPv6 network prefix assigned in the
PMIP Binding Acknowledgement is sent in the Router Advertisement.
\- If the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6:
\- The IPv6 network prefix allocation via IPv6 Stateless Address auto-
configuration procedure and IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6
procedure are the same as for PDN type IPv6 defined in pervious bullets.
\- If initial attach and deferred IPv4 address allocation is used, the Serving
GW shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Proxy
Binding Update. In this case no IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW during
the attach procedure. Only IPv6 network prefix is returned to the Serving
Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The PDN GW shall also send the
DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the same PBA message. Then
the Serving GW shall respond to the UE by setting the IPv4 PDN Address to
0.0.0.0. The UE may obtain an IPv4 address subsequently, by initiating DHCPv4
procedure as specified in figure 4.7.1-1.
\- If initial attach and deferred IPv4 address allocation is not used, the
Serving GW shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the
Proxy Binding Update. In this case IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW
during the attach procedure. IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address is returned
to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The Serving GW
shall deliver IPv4 address to the UE.
\- For handover attach (i.e. Request Type set to \"handover\"), the Serving GW
shall request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding
Update, irrespective of whether the UE requested deferred IPv4 address or not.
The previously assigned IPv6 network prefix and/or IPv4 address are returned
to the Serving Gateway in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement during the
handover attach procedure. If deferred IPv4 address allocation is used for
this PDN connection, the PDN GW shall also send the DHCPv4 Address Allocation
Procedure Indication in the same PBA message. In this case, the UE IPv4
address is not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures to
the UE. The Serving GW shall respond to the MME by setting the PDN Address to
0.0.0.0. The MME then forwards the 0.0.0.0 address to the UE. After the
default bearer establishment procedure is completed, the UE uses the
connectivity with the EPS and may renew the IPv4 address allocation using
DHCPv4. The IPv4 Address provided to the UE by subsequent DHCPv4, when
initiated by the UE, must correspond to the value provided in the PBA.
\- If the IPv4 address is provided to the UE by using DHCPv4 procedure, then
at any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4
address lease time expires, the PDN GW initiates the \"PDN Gateway initiated
IPv4 address Delete\" procedure to delete the IPv4 address from the PDN
connection and bearer contexts. The same IPv4 address shall not be allocated
to another UE immediately.
\- If an external PDN Address Allocation is needed, the PDN GW follows the
same procedures defined in TS 23.401 [4] to obtain the external IP address
after the PBU is received and before the PBA is sent.
Figure 4.7.1-1: IPv4 Address Allocation using DHCP with DHCP Server Collocated
with the PDN GW and DHCP Relay in the Serving GW
1\. If the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6 or IPv4,
after the default bearer is setup, the UE sends a DHCPv4 Discovery message in
broadcast to the network to find available servers.
Steps 2-3 and 11‑14 are only executed if the PDN type is IPv4v6 and IPv4
address was not allocated by the PDN GW in the initial attach procedure. The
interaction of PBU messages (2-3) with DHCPv4 related messages (1, 4‑10) is
based on RFC 5844 [17].
2\. The Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, APN, UE Address Info)
to the PDN GW in order to request the new IPv4 address and update the current
registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the message is being sent.
To request for IPv4 address for the UE, the UE Address Information should
contain IPv4 address option set to 0.0.0.0, and the HNP shall be set to the
HNP of the IP-CAN Session.
3\. The PDN GW responds with a PMIPv6 Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, UE
Address Info) message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI
sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The PDN GW takes into account the request
from Serving GW and the policies of operator when the PDN GW allocates the UE
Address Info. The UE address info returns the assigned IPv4 Address and/or
IPv6 prefix previously assigned to the UE during attach, if one was requested
in the PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update message. Otherwise, the PDN GW validates
the addresses and returns in the UE Address Info IE the IPv4 address and/or
IPv6 prefix received in the Proxy Binding Update message.
4\. Upon receiving the DHCPv4 Discovery message, the Serving GW acting as a
relay agent shall add its address in the GIADDR option and add the assigned UE
IPv4 address (received from PDN GW at the PBA message), if available in the
\"Address Request\" option, and relay the message in unicast within the PMIPv6
tunnel to PDN GW acting as a DHCPv4 server.
5\. When receiving the DHCPv4 Discovery message, the PDN GW should verify the
GIADDR option. Then the PDN GW uses \"Address Request\" option and/or the
PMIPv6 tunnel on which the DHCPv4 message is received to identify the UE
binding and update it with the \'client identifier\' and \'chaddr\'
combination for subsequent DHCPv4 procedure. After that the PDN GW extends an
IPv4 lease offer and sending the DHCPv4 Offer with the assigned UE IPv4
address.
6\. The Serving GW acting as DHCPv4 relay agent relays the DHCPv4 message to
the UE.
7\. When the UE receives the lease offer, it sends a DHCPREQUEST message
containing the received IPv4 address.
8\. The Serving GW acting as DHCPv4 relay agent relays the DHCPv4 message to
the PDN GW.
9\. When the PDN GW receives the DHCPREQUEST message from the UE, it sends a
DHCPACK packet to the UE. This message includes the lease duration and any
other configuration information that the client might have requested.
10\. The Serving GW acting as DHCPv4 relay agent relays the DHCPv4 message to
the UE.
When receiving the DHCPACK message, the UE completes TCP/IP configuration
process.
11\. In case a new IPv4 address is allocated, the PDN-GW initiates the PCEF
initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19]
to inform the PCRF of the IPv4 address allocated to the UE. If PCC rules have
changed the PCRF provides the updated PCC rules to the PDN-GW as part of this
procedure.
12\. In case QoS rules have to be modified, e.g. change of SDF filters, the
PCRF initiates a GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure as described in
TS 23.203 [19] to inform the S‑GW of the updated QoS rules.
13\. The S‑GW initiates the \"Bearer Modification Procedure without bearer QoS
update\" as described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.3, between steps (A) and
(B).
14\. The S‑GW informs the PCRF of the success of the QoS rules enforcement,
thus ending the GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure described in TS
23.203 [19].
The PDN GW shall discard the unicast DHCPv4 Discovery or Request message with
an empty or unknown GIADDR option, if the assigned UE IPv4 address is not
delivered to the UE yet.
NOTE 1: The DHCPv4 client may skip DHCPv4 Discovery phase, and send DHCPv4
Request message in broadcast as the first message. In this case, the Serving
GW acting as a relay agent shall add its address in the GIADDR option and add
the assigned UE IPv4 address (received from PDN GW in the PBA message) in the
\"Address Request\" option if one was provided in the attach procedure, and
relay the message in unicast within the PMIPv6 tunnel to PDN GW acting as a
DHCPv4 server.
NOTE 2: After releasing the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 Release procedure, UE
can request an IPv4 address for the same PDN connection subsequently.
NOTE 3: Allocation of IP address from an external PDN using Radius or Diameter
requires the \"Proxy Binding Update\" of PMIPv6 to carry the relevant PCO that
is transported by GTP.
Figure 4.7.1-2: IPv6 Prefix allocation after the PDN connection setup
procedure
1\. A PDN connection is setup over 3GPP access, after the E-UTRAN initial
Attach with PMIP-based S5/S8 procedure as defined in clause 5.2, UE requested
PDN connectivity as defined in clause 5.6.1, or intra-3GPP access handover
with Serving GW relocation as defined in clause 5.7, or handover from non-3GPP
IP Access with S2a/S2b to 3GPP Access with PMIPv6 on S5/S8 as defined in
clause 8.2.1.2 or 8.2.1.4 or 9.5.2.
2\. If the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6 or IPv6, the
UE may send a Router Solicitation message to the network to solicit a Router
Advertisement message.
3\. Upon receiving the Route Solicitation message or after the PDN connection
setup procedure, the Serving GW shall send an IPv6 Router Advertisement
message as specified in IETF RFC 4862 [58] to the UE for PDN connection type
IPv4v6 or IPv6 (i.e. the Serving GW acts as an advertising interface as
specified in IETF RFC 4861 [59] for the PDN connection type IPv4v6 or IPv6).
The Router Advertisement messages shall contain the assigned IPv6 prefix
received in the PMIPv6 Binding Acknowledgement message. After the UE has
received the Router Advertisement message, it constructs a full IPv6 address
via IPv6 Stateless Address autoconfiguration in accordance with IETF RFC 4862
[58]. However, the UE shall not use any identifiers defined in TS 23.003 [16]
as the basis for generating the interface identifier. For privacy, the UE may
change the interface identifier used to generate full IPv6 address, as defined
in TS 23.221 [60] without involving the network.
NOTE 4: In order to renew the allocated IPv6 prefix, the Serving GW sends an
IPv6 Router Advertisement (solicited or unsolicited) to the UE i.e. the
Serving GW acts as an advertising interface as specified in IETF RFC 4861 [59]
for the PDN connection type IPv4v6 or IPv6.
When sending the IPv6 Router Advertisement message, the Serving GW may trigger
the paging (e.g. by sending a Downlink Data Notification message to the MME)
if the UE is in idle state.
### 4.7.2 IP Address Allocation in Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access using PMIPv6 on
S2a
IP address is allocated to the UE when connectivity to new PDN is initiated.
The IP address can be provided by either PDN GW or external PDN. Access GW in
trusted non-3GPP access system is responsible for delivering the IP address to
the UE. Based on the signalling between the UE and the non-3GPP IP access
system the UE should be able to know the connected PDN identity (APN). This
enables the UE to uniquely associate each allocated IP address with the PDN
from where it was allocated.
The trusted non-3GPP Access shall support at least one of the following
functionalities in order to successfully allocate IP address to the UE in the
EPC:
\- Support of DHCPv4 relay agent functionality for IPv4 parameter
configuration and IP address allocation as specified in RFC 2131 [28] and RFC
4039 [29] and described in clause 4.7.1 for the Serving GW. This functionality
is used to support DHCPv4 based IPv4 address allocation mechanism in the UE.
For this case the following applies:
\- At initial attach or handover attach, if the PDN type is IPv4 only, the
trusted non-3GPP IP Access shall request IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding
Update. The Protocol Configuration Options in the Proxy Binding Update
includes the Address Allocation Preference to indicate that deferred IPv4
address allocation was requested by the UE. In the same way as it is defined
in clause 4.7.1, the IPv4 address is assigned by the PDN GW during the initial
attach procedure and the IPv4 address is returned in the Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement. The DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication is
included in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement to indicate that IPv4 address
allocation using DHCPv4 is allowed. The MAG shall not deliver the assigned
IPv4 address to the UE before the DHCPv4 address allocation. After the PMIPv6
tunnel is set up between the trusted non-3GPP Access and the PDN GW, the
trusted non-3GPP Access may relay the DHCPv4 messages between the UE and the
PDN GW for IPv4 parameter configuration and IPv4 address allocation as
specified for the Serving GW in figure 4.7.1-1.
\- At initial attach and handover attach, if the PDN type is IPv4v6 and
deferred IPv4 address allocation is used, the trusted non-3GPP IP Access shall
request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update.
The Protocol Configuration Options in the Proxy Binding Update includes the
Address Allocation Preference to indicate that deferred IPv4 address
allocation was requested by the UE. In the same way as it is defined in clause
4.7.1, if deferred IPv4 address allocation is allowed, no IPv4 address is
assigned by the PDN GW during the initial attach procedure, only IPv6 network
prefix is returned in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The DHCPv4 Address
Allocation Procedure Indication is included in the Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement to indicate that IPv4 address allocation using DHCPv4 is
allowed. After the PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access and the PDN GW, when the UE requests the IPv4 address via DHCPv4, the
trusted non-3GPP Access and PDN GW perform steps 2 and 3 in Figure 4.7.1-1,
and then the non-3GPP Access may relay the DHCPv4 messages between the UE and
the PDN GW for IPv4 parameter configuration and IPv4 address allocation as
specified in figure 4.7.1-1.
\- Any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4
address lease time expires, and if the PDN Type is IPv4, the PDN GW initiates
\"PDN-GW-initiated PDN-disconnection\" procedure for the given PDN connection.
The same IPv4 address shall not be allocated to another UE immediately.
\- Any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4
address lease time expires, and if the PDN Type is IPv4v6, the PDN GW
initiates the \"PDN GW initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure\" procedure to
delete the IPv4 address from the PDN connection and from bearer contexts. The
same IP address shall not be allocated to another UE immediately.
\- Support of DHCPv4 server functionality for IPv4 parameter configuration and
IP address allocation as specified in RFC 2131 [28] and RFC 4039 [29]. This
functionality is used to support DHCPv4 based IPv4 address allocation
mechanism in the UE. For this case the following applies:
\- At initial attach and handover attach, if the PDN type is IPv4v6 and
deferred IPv4 address allocation is used, the trusted non-3GPP IP Access shall
request both IPv6 network prefix and IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update.
The Protocol Configuration Options in the Proxy Binding Update includes the
Address Allocation Preference to indicate that deferred IPv4 address
allocation was requested by the UE. In the same way as it is defined in clause
4.7.1, if deferred IPv4 address allocation is allowed, no IPv4 address is
assigned by the PDN GW during the initial attach procedure, only IPv6 network
prefix and the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication are returned in
the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. After the PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between
the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW, when the UE requests the IPv4
address via DHCPv4, the MAG in Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access requests the IPv4
address for the UE from the PDN GW via PMIPv6 signalling as it is described in
Figure 4.7.2-1.
NOTE 1: At initial attach and handover attach, if the PDN type is IPv4, the
trusted non-3GPP IP Access requests IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update
and the PDN GW returns an IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement.
In this case the PDN GW is not aware of how and when the IPv4 address is
delivered to the UE.
\- Any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4
address lease time expires, and if the PDN Type is IPv4, the trusted non-3GPP
access system will initiate \"Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access requested PDN
Disconnection Procedure with PMIPv6\" procedure for the given PDN connection.
The same IP address shall not be allocated to another UE immediately.
\- Any time after the UE releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4
address lease time expires, and if the PDN Type is IPv4v6, the non-3GPP access
may initiate \"Non-3GPP access initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure\"
procedure to delete the IPv4 address from the PDN connection and bearer
contexts. The same IP address shall not be allocated to another UE
immediately.
\- Support of DHCPv6 (relay agent or server) functionality for IPv6 parameter
configuration as specified in RFC 3736 [30]. This functionality is required to
support DHCPv6 based parameter configuration mechanism in the UE.
\- Support of prefix advertisement for IPv6 prefix received from PDN GW in
PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Acknowledgement.
\- Support for IPv4 Address allocation that is received from PDN GW from
PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Acknowledgement using access specific mechanisms.
NOTE 2: Configuration parameters are received from the PDN GW by using
DHCPv4/v6 (the non-3GPP Access GW acting as DHCPv4/v6 relay towards the PDN
GW) or PMIPv6 PCO in the PBA message.
NOTE 3: When DHCPv4/v6 is used between the non-3GPP Access GW and PDN GW, the
DHCPv4/v6 messages are sent within the PMIPv6 tunnel.
NOTE 4: After releasing the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 Release procedure, UE
can request an IPv4 address for the same PDN connection subsequently.
\- Support of static IP address allocation. The non-3GPP access may receive a
static IP address (i.e. a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix)
from HSS/AAA during access authentication and authorization procedure. Then
the non-3GPP access should forward the static IP address to the PDN GW.
NOTE 5: For static address allocation, a static PDN GW is selected by either
having the APN configured to map to a given PDN GW, or the PDN GW identity
provided by the HSS/AAA indicates the static PDN GW.
Figure 4.7.2-1: IPv4 Address Allocation using DHCP with DHCP Server Collocated
with the MAG when PDN type is IPv4v6
1\. If the PDN type associated with the PDN connection is IPv4v6, after the
PDN connection establishment, the UE sends a DHCPv4 Discovery message in
broadcast to the network to find available servers.
2\. The MAG in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN
NAI, APN, UE Address Info) to the PDN GW in order to request the new IPv4
address and update the current registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE for
whom the message is being sent. To request for IPv4 address for the UE, the UE
Address Information should contain IPv4 address option set to 0.0.0.0, and the
HNP shall be set to the HNP of the PDN connection.
3\. Upon receiving the PBU message from the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access the PDN
GW allocates an IPv4 address for the UE in accordance with the operator\'s
policies. The PDN GW responds with a PMIPv6 Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI,
UE Address Info) message to the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access. The MN NAI is
identical to the MN NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The UE address info
returns the assigned IPv4 Address and IPv6 prefix previously assigned to the
UE during attach.
4\. The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access acting as a DHCPv4 server sends the DHCPv4
Offer with the assigned UE IPv4 address received in the PBA message in step 3.
5\. When the UE receives the lease offer, it sends a DHCPREQUEST message
containing the received IPv4 address.
6 The MAG in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access acting as DHCPv4 server sends a
DHCPACK packet to the UE. This message includes the lease duration and any
other configuration information that the client might have requested.
When receiving the DHCPACK message, the UE completes TCP/IP configuration
process.
7\. In case a new IPv4 address is allocated, the PDN-GW initiates the PCEF
initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19]
to inform the PCRF of the IPv4 address allocated to the UE. If PCC rules have
changed the PCRF provides the updated PCC rules to the PDN-GW as part of this
procedure. This step can happen any time after step 3.
8\. In case QoS rules have to be modified, e.g. change of SDF filters, the
PCRF initiates a GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure as described in
TS 23.203 [19] to inform the S GW of the updated QoS rules.
NOTE 6: The DHCPv4 client may skip DHCPv4 Discovery phase, and send DHCPv4
Request message in broadcast as the first message.
NOTE 7: After releasing the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 Release procedure, UE
can request an IPv4 address for the same PDN connection subsequently.
### 4.7.3 IP Address Allocation in Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access using PMIPv6
or GTP on S2b
When an Untrusted Non-3GPP IP access is used two types of IP address are
allocated to the UE:
\- An IP address, which is used by the UE within the Untrusted Non-3GPP IP
Access Network to get IP connectivity towards the ePDG.
\- One or more IP address(es), which is used by the UE towards the external
PDNs via the allocated PDN GW(s).
The IP address that is allocated by the Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access Network
is used as the end point of the IPSec SAs between the UE and the ePDG. The
allocation of this IP address is out of the scope of this specification.
The IP address(es) that are allocated by the PDN GW(s) are allocated to the UE
when connectivity to a new PDN is initiated. The IP address(es) can be
provided by either PDN GW or external PDN as it is specified in clause 5.3.1.1
of TS 23.401 [4]. The ePDG receives the allocated IP address(es) within the
PMIP Proxy Binding Acknowledgement or GTP Create Session Response and the ePDG
is responsible for delivering the IP address(es) to the UE. The ePDG shall
provide the UE with connected PDN information (APN), so that the UE can
uniquely associate each allocated IP address with the PDN from where it was
allocated.
The ePDG may receive a static IP address (i.e. a static IPv4 address and/or a
static IPv6 prefix) from HSS/AAA during IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure.
Then the ePDG should forward the static IP address to the PDN GW.
NOTE: For static address allocation, a static PDN GW is selected by either
having the APN configured to map to a given PDN GW, or the PDN GW identity
provided by the HSS/AAA indicates the static PDN GW.
### 4.7.4 IP Address Allocation using S2c
Prior the use of S2c an IP address which will be used as a care-of address
shall be allocated to the UE.
When a Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network is used one or more IP addresses are
allocated to the UE by the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network. One of these IP
addresses is used by the UE as care-of address within DSMIPv6. The allocation
of these IP addresses is out of the scope this specification.
When an Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Network is used one or more IP addresses are
allocated to the UE by the Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Network. The allocation
of these IP addresses is out of the scope of 3GPP. One of these IP addresses
is used by the UE as the IP address towards the ePDG when IPSec SAs are
established. During the IPSec SA establishment the ePDG allocates and delivers
an IP address to the UE, which IP address is used by the UE as care-of address
within DSMIPv6. This IP address is allocated by the ePDG either by using an
internal address pool or using an external server, such as DHCP. The
allocation of this IP address is implementation specific.
When a UE is connecting to a PDN via S2c, address allocation for that PDN
takes place as follows.
During IKEv2 exchange for bootstrapping the DSMIPv6 security association (see
clause 6.3) the following parameters can be negotiated between the UE and the
PDN GW/HA:
\- The IPv6 prefix to which the IPv6 Home Address belongs, also called the
\"Home Network Prefix\" and the PDN associated with the IPv6 prefix (PDN is
indicated with APN);
\- The UE\'s IPv6 Home Address;
\- The DNS server address for that PDN.
The UE may request additional configuration parameters by running stateless
DHCP as defined in RFC 4039 [29] and RFC 3736 [30] over the DSMIPv6 tunnel.
The UE may also request an IPv4 home address using DSMIPv6 signalling, as
defined in RFC 5555 [10].
The PDN GW/HA may receive a static IP address (i.e. a static IPv4 address
and/or a static IPv6 prefix) from HSS/AAA during the authentication and
authorization procedure. Then the PDN GW/HA shall assign the static IP address
to the UE, as indicated above.
NOTE: The UE selects a PDN GW as specified in clause 4.5.2. In case the PDN GW
selected by the UE is different from the static PDN GW stored in the HSS, the
PDN GW reallocation procedure (see clause 6.10) shall be performed.
### 4.7.5 IPv6 Prefix Delegation using S2c
Optionally a single network prefix shorter than a /64 prefix may be assigned
to a PDN connection (TS 23.401 [4]). When S2c is used to access a PDN, the UE
acting as a Mobile Router may request delegation of one or more IPv6
prefix(es) via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation signalling as described in RFC 6267
[56]. The UE does not need to explicitly register these additional prefixes
using S2c signaling as implicit mode registration is used.
## 4.8 Network Discovery and Selection
### 4.8.0 General Principles
The following principles apply when the UE is registered in the Home PLMN or
in a PLMN which is equivalent to the home PLMN and when both 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses are available or when multiple non-3GPP accesses are available:
\- The EPS network may provide the UE with assistance data/policies about
available accesses located in the Home PLMN or in a PLMN equivalent to the
Home PLMN, to allow the UE to scan for accesses and select an access.
\- If the UE is capable of routing different IP flows to the same PDN
connection through different access networks (see TS 23.261 [55]), the EPS
network shall allow the operator to influence the access where a specific IP
flow shall be routed.
\- If the UE is capable of routing different simultaneously active PDN
connections through different access networks, the EPS network shall allow the
operator to influence the access where a specific PDN connection shall be
routed.
\- Assistance data/policies are provided only after establishing secure
communication, as specified in TS 33.402 [45].
\- The assistance data/policies provided to UE may depend on the UE\'s
subscription data.
\- The EPS network allows the operator to influence the access that the UE
shall handover to (when in active mode) or re-select (when in idle mode).
\- Multi-access network discovery and selection works for both single-radio
and multiple- radio terminals. For the case of multiple-radio terminals,
multi-access network discovery and selection works without requiring all
radios supported by the UE to be switched on.
\- No architectural impact is foreseen for network selection upon initial
network attachment.
\- The UE may provide information to the network for the retrieval of the
assistance data/policies.
The following principles apply when the UE is registered in a Visited PLMN
(VPLMN) and when both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are available or when
multiple non-3GPP accesses are available:
\- The VPLMN shall be able to provide Access Network Discovery information
only for 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks that provide connectivity to the
VPLMN or to a PLMN equivalent to the VPLMN, or to both.
\- The VPLMN shall be able to provide to a roaming UE Inter-System Mobility
Policies and/or Inter System Routing Policies (see clause 4.8.2.1). Such
policies shall be valid only in the VLPMN or in a PLMN equivalent to the
VPLMN, as per roaming agreements.
\- The Home PLMN (HPLMN) shall be able to provide to a roaming UE Access
Network Discovery information for 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks that
provide connectivity to the HPLMN or to a PLMN equivalent to the HPLMN, or to
both.
\- The HPLMN shall be able to provide to a roaming UE Inter-System Mobility
Policies and/or Inter System Routing Policies.
\- When the UE receives Inter System Routing Policies from the HPLMN and the
VPLMN, it shall resolve potential conflicts according to the procedures
specified in TS 24.302 [54].
\- When the UE receives Inter System Mobility Policies from the HPLMN and the
VPLMN, it shall resolve potential conflicts according to the procedures
specified in TS 24.302 [54].
The multi-access network discovery and selection mechanism shall not interfere
with the existing 3GPP PLMN selection mechanisms used for the 3GPP Access
Technologies (specified in TS 23.122 [53]), with the existing 3GPP PLMN
selection mechanisms used for I‑WLAN access (specified in TS 23.234 [5]) and
with the existing 3GPP2 network selection mechanisms. In particular, when PLMN
selection is applicable, it is performed before any access network discovery
and selection procedures based on ANDSF (see TS 24.302 [54]).
The ANDSF\'s policy and the UE implementation shall ensure that PLMN changes
are not conducted more often than the time stored in the USIM (in EF~HPPLMN~,
see TS 31.102 [46]) for the \"periodic network selection attempts\" specified
in TS 22.011 [47].
NOTE: A change between the HPLMN and another PLMN equivalent to the HPLMN may
be triggered by the ANDSF, but is not considered a PLMN reselection.
### 4.8.1 Architecture for Access Network Discovery Support Functions
The following architecture may be used for access network discovery and
selection. The support and the use of these functions and interfaces are
optional.
Figure 4.8.1.1-1: Non-Roaming Architecture for Access Network Discovery
Support Functions
Figure 4.8.1.1-2: Roaming Architecture for Access Network Discovery Support
Functions
The architecture is based on a new network element called Access Network
Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF). An ANDSF element located in the home
PLMN of a UE is referred to as the Home-ANDSF (H‑ANDSF) for this UE, whereas
an ANDSF element located in the visited PLMN of a UE is referred to as the
Visited-ANDSF (V‑ANDSF) for this UE. Unless otherwise specified, the term
ANDSF is used to refer to both an H‑ANDSF and a V‑ANDSF. Details about the
ANDSF functionality and its interaction with the UE are provided in clause
4.8.2.1.
The ANDSF is an optional element in the network architecture and thus a UE may
or may not be able to interact with an H‑ANDSF and/or with a V‑ANDSF.
The UE-ANDSF interaction can take place via non-seamless WLAN offload (see
clause 4.1.5) or via any 3GPP or non-3GPP access technology that can be used
by the UE to access EPC.
NOTE: ANDSF push interactions might not always be possible via non-seamless
WLAN offload.
### 4.8.2 Network Elements
#### 4.8.2.1 Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF)
The ANDSF contains data management and control functionality necessary to
provide network discovery and selection assistance data as per operators\'
policy. The ANDSF shall respond to UE requests for access network discovery
information (pull mode operation) and may be able to initiate data transfer to
the UE (push mode operation), based on network triggers or as a result of
previous communication with the UE.
NOTE 1: In this Release, the OMA DM Push mechanism may not work in all
possible scenarios and the ANDSF may not always be able to initiate a session
to the UE.
NOTE 2: The usage of ANDSF capabilities is intended for scenarios where
access-network level solutions are not sufficient for the UE to perform
Network Discovery and Selection of non-3GPP technologies according to operator
policies.
The ANDSF shall comply with regulatory requirements pertaining to the privacy
and confidentiality of user location information.
The ANDSF shall be able to provide the following information:
1) Inter-system mobility policy:
\- The inter-system mobility policy is a set of operator-defined rules and
preferences that affect the inter-system mobility decisions taken by the UE.
The UE uses the inter-system mobility policy when it can route IP traffic only
over a single radio access interface at a given time (e.g. is not IFOM capable
or its IFOM capability is disabled) in order to:
(i) decide when inter-system mobility is allowed or restricted; and
(ii) to select the most preferable access technology type or access network
that should be used to access EPC.
NOTE 3: The inter-system mobility policy does not indicate the most preferable
access network or access technology type that should be used to access CS
services.
For example, an inter-system mobility policy may indicate that inter-system
handover from E-UTRAN access to WLAN access is not allowed. It may also
indicate e.g. that WiMAX access is more preferable to WLAN access.
\- The inter-system mobility policy may be provisioned in the UE and may be
updated by the ANDSF based on network triggers or after receiving a UE request
for network discovery and selection information.
\- The inter-system mobility policy identifies which access technology type or
which specific access network is mostly preferable for EPC access. It shall be
able to indicate:
\- If a specific access technology type is preferable to another (e.g. WiMAX
is preferable to WLAN).
\- If a specific access network identifier is preferable to another (e.g. WLAN
SSID‑1 is preferable to WLAN SSID‑2).
\- The inter-system mobility policy identifies also when inter-system mobility
is allowed or restricted. It shall be able to indicate:
\- If inter-system mobility is restricted from one access technology type to
another (e.g. handover from WiMAX to WLAN is restricted).
\- If inter-system mobility is restricted when certain conditions are met.
\- Validity conditions, i.e. conditions indicating when a policy is valid
(such conditions may include e.g. a time duration, a location area, etc.). The
validity conditions may also indicate when the UE shall request for new
policies.
\- The inter-system mobility policy indicates whether the operator-preferred
list of access networks or access technology types for EPC access, shall take
precedence over corresponding user-preferred list, when automatic access
network selection is used.
2) Access network discovery information:
\- Upon UE request, the ANDSF may provide a list of access networks available
in the vicinity of the UE for all the access technology types requested by the
UE (if any requested).
\- The ANDSF provides information for access networks that are available to
the UE including:
\- the access technology type (e.g. WLAN, WiMAX).
\- the radio access network identifier (e.g. the SSID of a WLAN).
\- other technology specific information, e.g. one or more carrier
frequencies.
\- validity conditions, i.e. conditions indicating when the provided access
network discovery information is valid (such conditions may include e.g. a
location).
\- The UE may retain and use the access network discovery information provided
by the ANDSF until new/updated information is retrieved.
3) Inter-System Routing Policy:
\- The ANDSF may provide a list of Inter-System Routing Policies to the UE
independently of the UE capability that are capable of routing IP traffic
simultaneously over multiple radio access interfaces. The UE uses the inter-
system routing policies when it can route IP traffic simultaneously over
multiple radio access interfaces (e.g. it is an IFOM capable UE with the IFOM
capability enabled or a MAPCON capable UE with the MAPCON capability enabled)
in order to meet the operator routing / offload preferences by:
(i) deciding when an access technology type / access network is restricted for
a specific IP traffic flow and/or a specific APN; and
(ii) selecting the most preferable access technologies / access networks
and/or APNs which should be used by the UE when available to route IP traffic
that matches specific criteria (e.g. all traffic to a specific APN, or all
traffic belonging to a specific IP flow, or all traffic of a specific
application, etc).
\- The inter-system routing policy may be provisioned in the UE and may be
updated by the ANDSF based on network triggers or after receiving a UE request
for network discovery and selection information.
\- The inter-system routing policy includes the following information:
\- Validity conditions, i.e. conditions indicating when the provided policy is
valid.
\- For IFOM: one or more Filter Rules, each one identifying a prioritised list
of access technologies / access networks which should be used by the UE when
available to route traffic that matches specific IP traffic filters on a
specific APN or on any APN. A filter rule also identifies which radio accesses
are restricted for traffic that matches specific IP traffic filters on
aspecific APN (e.g. WLAN is not allowed for RTP/RTCP traffic flows on APN-x)
or on any APN;
\- For MAPCON: one or more Filter Rules, each one identifying a prioritised
list of access technologies / access networks which should be used by the UE
when available to route PDN connections to specific APNs. A filter rule also
identifies which radio accesses are restricted for PDN connections to specific
APNs (e.g. WLAN is not allowed for PDN connection to APN-x);
\- For non-seamless WLAN offload specified in clause 4.1.5: one or more Filter
Rules, each one identifying which traffic shall or shall not be non-seamlessly
offloaded to a WLAN when available. It shall be possible to restrict certain
traffic from using non-seamless WLAN offload only in specific WLAN access
networks or in all WLAN access networks. Similarly, it shall be possible to
permit certain traffic to use non-seamless WLAN offload only in specific WLAN
access networks or in all WLAN access networks.
\- For IFOM and for non-seamless WLAN offload, each Filter Rule may identify
traffic based on destination/source address, transport protocol,
destination/source port numbers, DSCP or Traffic Class, destination domain
name and application identity.
\- For MAPCON each Filter Rule identifies traffic based on APN.
\- The Filter Rules for IFOM, MAPCON and non-seamless WLAN offload are
associated with a rule priority. If more than one valid Filter Rules for IFOM,
MAPCON and non-seamless WLAN offload match a specific IP traffic flow, the UE
applies the Filter Rule with the highest rule priority.
NOTE 4: The way how inter-system routing policies are realized in the OMA DM
management object(s) is outside the scope of this specification and is left
for Stage 3.
Subject to operator\'s configuration, the ANDSF may obtain the permanent UE
identity, e.g. based on the security solution specified in TS 33.402 [45].
There are three types of information provided by the ANDSF, i.e. the inter-
system mobility policy, the access network discovery information and the
inter-system routing policy. The ANDSF may provide all types of information or
only one of them.
The H-ANDSF selects the inter-system mobility policies, the access network
discovery information and the inter-system routing policies to be delivered to
the UE according to the operator requirements and the roaming agreements. If
the permanent UE identity is known to the H-ANDSF, and subject to operator\'s
configuration, the available subscription data (e.g. the list of access
networks, or access technology types, the UE is authorized to use, etc.) may
also be used by the H-ANDSF for selecting the inter-system mobility policies,
the access network discovery information and the inter-system routing
policies.
The V-ANDSF selects the inter-system mobility policies, the access network
discovery information and the inter-system routing policies to be delivered to
the UE according to the operator requirements and the roaming agreements.
If the UE has access network discovery information, inter-system mobility
policies or inter-system routing policies valid for its present location,
which indicate that there is an access network in its vicinity with higher
priority than the currently selected access network(s), the UE should perform
procedures for discovering and reselecting the higher priority access network,
if this is allowed by user preferences.
NOTE 5: How frequently the UE performs the discovery and reselection procedure
depends on the UE implementation.
A UE that is not capable of routing IP traffic simultaneously over multiple
radio access interfaces (e.g. a non-IFOM or non-MAPCON capable UE, or a UE
that has such a capability disabled, or a UE not capable of non-seamless WLAN
offload) shall select the most preferable available access network for inter-
system mobility based on the received / provisioned inter-system mobility
policies and user preferences and shall disregard the inter-system routing
policies it may have received from the ANDSF. When automatic access network
selection is used, the UE shall not initiate a connection to the EPC using an
access network indicated as restricted by inter-system mobility policies. When
the UE selects a non-3GPP radio access as indicated by the preferences in the
inter-system mobility policies, the UE may still use 3GPP access for CS
services.
NOTE 6: The user may manually select the access technology type or access
network that should be used by the UE; in such a case the inter-system
mobility policies are not taken into account.
A UE that is capable of routing IP traffic simultaneously over multiple radio
access interfaces (i.e. an IFOM or MAPCON capable UE, or a UE capable of non-
seamless WLAN offload) may be pre-provisioned with or shall be able to receive
from the ANDSF (if the UE supports communication with ANDSF) both inter-system
mobility policies and inter-system routing policies. When the UE has the IFOM,
the MAPCON and the non-seamless WLAN offload capabilities disabled, the UE
shall select the most preferable available access network based on the
received / provisioned inter-system mobility policies and user preferences.
When the UE has the IFOM or MAPCON or non-seamless WLAN offload capability
enabled, the UE shall select the most preferable available access networks
based on the received / provisioned inter-system routing policies and user
preferences. In addition, the UE shall route traffic that matches specific IP
traffic filters according to the filter rules in the received / provisioned
inter-system routing policies and according to the user preferences.
When roaming, it shall be possible for the UE to resolve potential conflicts
between the policies provided by the H‑ANDSF and the policies provided by the
V‑ANDSF. This applies to both the inter-system mobility policies and to the
inter-system routing policies. The UE behaviour when receiving policies from
H-ANDSF and V-ANDSF is specified in clause 4.8.0 and in TS 24.302 [54].
The ANDSF shall be able to limit the amount of information provided to the UE
based e.g. on the UE\'s current location, UE capabilities, etc. The ANDSF
shall be able to limit the load caused by the UE initiated requests towards
the ANDSF.
The H‑ANDSF in the subscriber\'s home operator network may interact with other
databases such as the HSS user profile information residing in subscriber\'s
home operator network. Details of such interaction with these databases are
not described in this Release of the specifications.
Inter-system mobility policies, access network discovery information and
inter-system routing policies may also be statically pre-configured by the
operator on the UE. The inter-system mobility policies, access network
discovery information and inter-system routing policies provided to the UE by
the ANDSF take precedence on the inter-system mobility policies, access
network discovery information and inter-system routing policies pre-configured
on the UE.
NOTE 7: The ANDSF policies sent to a UE are not expected to suggest such
access networks to which the user is not allowed to access.
### 4.8.3 Reference Points
**S14** This reference point is between UE and H‑ANDSF / V‑ANDSF for direct
queries via pull. It enables dynamic provision of information to the UE for
access NW discovery and selection procedures related to non-3GPP and 3GPP
accesses. This dynamic provision shall be supported with Pull (UE-initiated
session) and with Push (ANDSF-initiated session), if feasible. Communication
over S14 is secured as specified in TS 33.402 [45].
Protocol assumption:
\- S14 interface is realized above IP level.
### 4.8.4 ANDSF Discovery
In non-roaming scenario, the H‑ANDSF is discovered through interaction with
the Domain Name Service function or the DHCP Server function. The H‑ANDSF
address may also be provisioned to the UE.
In roaming scenario, the UE shall be possible to retrieve both the H‑ANDSF and
V‑ANDSF addresses.
NOTE: The ANDSF may not be contactable in certain PDNs.
### 4.8.5 Void
## 4.9 Authentication and Security
### 4.9.1 Access Authentication in non-3GPP Accesses
Non-3GPP access authentication defines the process that is used for Access
Control i.e. to permit or deny a subscriber to attach to and use the resources
of a non-3GPP IP access which is interworked with the EPC network. Non-3GPP
access authentication signalling is executed between the UE and the 3GPP AAA
server/HSS. The authentication signalling may pass through AAA proxies.
3GPP based access authentication is executed across a SWa/STa reference point
as depicted in the EPS architecture diagram. Following principles shall apply
in this case:
\- Transport of authentication signalling shall be independent of the non-3GPP
IP Access technology.
\- The 3GPP based access authentication signalling shall be based on IETF
protocols, for e.g., Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) as specified in
RFC 3748 [11].
The details of the access authentication procedure are defined in TS 33.402
[45].
### 4.9.2 Tunnel Authentication
Tunnel authentication refers to the procedure by which the UE and the ePDG
perform mutual authentication during the IPsec tunnel establishment between
the UE and the ePDG (SWu reference point).
Tunnel authentication is used only in case of Untrusted Non-3GPP Access and is
executed across a SWm reference point as depicted in the EPS architecture
diagram.
The details of the tunnel authentication procedure are defined in TS 33.402
[45].
## 4.10 QoS Concepts
### 4.10.1 General
The QoS model that is applied in conjunction with PMIP-based reference points
does not use bearer IDs in user plane packets. Instead it is based on packet
filters and associated QoS parameters (QCI, ARP, MBR, GBR) provided to the
access system through off-path signalling.
The PCRF signals the same packet filters and associated QoS parameters over
Gxa, Gxb and Gxc as over Gx; in other words the granularity of the QoS
information that is passed over Gxa, Gxb and Gxc is the same as over Gx.
### 4.10.2 Void
### 4.10.3 The EPS Bearer with PMIP-based S5/S8 and E-UTRAN access
Figure 4.10.3-1: Two Unicast EPS bearers (PMIP-based S5/S8 and E-UTRAN access)
For PMIP-based S5/S8 and E-UTRAN access, an EPS bearer consists of the
concatenation of one Radio Bearer and one S1 bearer. The PDN Connectivity
Service between a UE and an external packet data network is supported through
a concatenation of an EPS Bearer and IP connectivity between Serving GW and
PDN GW. QoS control between a Serving GW and a PDN GW is provided at the
Transport Network Layer (TNL).
The EPS bearer is realised by the following elements:
\- In the UE, UL TFT maps a traffic flow aggregate to an EPS bearer in the
uplink direction.
\- In the Serving GW, the DL TFT maps a traffic flow aggregate to an EPS
bearer in the downlink direction.
\- A radio bearer transports the packets of an EPS bearer between a UE and an
eNodeB. There is a one-to-one mapping between an EPS bearer and a radio
bearer.
\- An S1 bearer transports the packets of an EPS bearer between an eNodeB and
a Serving GW. There is a one-to-one mapping between an EPS bearer and a S1
bearer.
\- A per UE per PDN tunnel transports the packets of an EPS bearer between a
Serving GW and a PDN GW. There is a many-to-one mapping between an EPS bearer
and this per UE, per PDN tunnel.
\- A UE stores a mapping between an uplink packet filter and a radio bearer to
create the mapping between a traffic flow aggregate and a radio bearer in the
uplink.
\- An eNodeB stores a one-to-one mapping between a radio bearer and an S1
bearer to create the binding between a radio bearer and an S1 bearer in both
the uplink and the downlink direction.
\- A Serving GW stores a one-to-one mapping between a downlink packet filter
and an S1 bearer to create the mapping between a traffic flow aggregate and an
S1 bearer in the downlink.
\- A PDN GW enforces APN-AMBR across all SDFs of the same APN that is
associated with Non-GBR QCIs.
### 4.10.4 Application of PCC in the Evolved Packet System
EPS supports both static and dynamic PCC deployment options as specified in TS
23.401 [4].
NOTE 1: The local configuration of PCEF static policy and charging control
functionality is not subject to standardization and is not based on
subscription information.
In case of non-3GPP access that does not support an Gxa/b or S9 interface,
static QoS policies (e.g. based on subscription QoS parameters for default
connectivity) may be provided to the non-3GPP access through the AAA
infrastructure. To perform policy enforcement according to the subscription
QoS parameters for default connectivity, additional information may be
provided to the PDN GW in one of the following ways:
\- from the PCRF, if present and if the PDN GW supports the Gx interface;
\- from the 3GPP AAA Server through the S6b interface in the form of a static
QoS profile for the S2a, PMIP based S2b, and S2c reference points;
\- from the ePDG through GTP based S2b in the form of a static QoS profile
(Default EPS Bearer QoS), which the ePDG obtains from the 3GPP AAA Server
through the SWm interface.
NOTE 2: In the two last cases, the PCEF may change the provided values based
on interaction with the PCRF or based on local configuration.
When dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the PDN GW in case of PMIP
or GTP based signalling uses the access type information (RAT Type in 3GPP
access) contained in PMIP Proxy Binding Update messages or GTP Create Session
Request messages for, e.g. charging. When dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed, the PDN GW relies on the PCRF for indication of the handling
required due to the access technology.
The behaviour of the system when PCC is deployed only in VPLMN or only in
HPLMN is described in TS 23.203 [19].
For non-3GPP access that supports UEs with different Bearer Control Mode (BCM)
capabilities, it should be possible for the UE to signal its BCM capabilities
to the BBERF. It should also be possible for the BBERF to signal the selected
BCM to the UE. How this information is exchanged between the UE and the BBERF
is outside of the scope of 3GPP.
### 4.10.5 PDN connectivity service with GTP based S2b
For untrusted non-3GPP access to the EPC the PDN connectivity service is
provided by IPsec connectivity between the UE and the ePDG concatenated with
S2b bearer(s) between the ePDG and the PGW.
Figure 4.10.5-1: Two Unicast S2b bearers (GTP based S2b)
The SWu interface between the UE and the ePDG is identical for the GTP and
PMIP variants of S2b. The UE establishes a separate SWu instance (i.e. a
separate IPSec tunnel) for each PDN connection.
One default S2b bearer is established on the S2b interface when the UE
connects to a PDN, and that remains established throughout the lifetime of the
PDN connection to provide the UE with always-on IP connectivity to that PDN.
Additional dedicated S2b bearers may be established on S2b for the same PDN
connection depending on operator policy. The PGW establishes dedicated S2b
bearers on S2b for the same PDN connection based on PCC decisions as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
The ePDG releases the SWu instance when the default S2b bearer of the
associated PDN connection is released.
The S2b bearer is realized by the following elements:
\- A GTP tunnel on S2b transports the packets of an S2b bearer between the
ePDG and a PDN GW;
\- The ePDG stores the mapping between uplink packet filters it receives from
the PGW (e.g. in the Create Bearer Request message) and the corresponding S2b
bearer;
\- The PDN GW stores the mapping between downlink packet filters and an S2b
bearer.
In support for the UE connectivity with the PDN:
\- A SWu instance (i.e. a IPSec tunnel) transports the packets of all S2b
bearer(s) for the same PDN Connection between the UE and the ePDG.
The ePDG routes uplink packets to the different bearers based on the uplink
packet filters in the TFTs assigned to the bearers in the PDN connection, in
the same way as a UE does for uplink traffic under 3GPP access. If no match is
found, the uplink data packet shall be sent via the bearer that does not have
any uplink packet filter assigned. If all bearers (including the default
bearer for that PDN) have been assigned an uplink packet filter, the ePDG
shall discard the uplink data packet.
The PDN GW routes downlink packets to the different bearers based on the
downlink packet filters in in the TFTs assigned to the S2b bearers in the PDN
connection, in the same way as the PDN GW does on GTP-based S5/S8 bearers (see
TS 23.401 [4] clause 4.7.2.2).
## 4.11 Charging for Non-3GPP Accesses
The following are related to Non-3GPP accesses:
\- Accounting information, e.g. the amount of data transmitted in uplink and
downlink direction categorized with the QCI per UE, could be collected by
components, if any, in the Non-3GPP access networks for inter-operator
settlements.
NOTE: Specification of the above functionality is outside the scope of this
TS.
## 4.12 Multiple PDN Support
General high level principles for the support of multiple PDNs are provided in
TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.10.1. In addition, the following applies:
\- Simultaneous exchange of IP traffic to multiple PDNs is supported in the
EPS, when the network policies, non-3GPP access and user subscription allow
it. UE Support for multiple overlapping IP address spaces is optional.
\- Multiple PDN connections for a given APN and UE can be supported with the
restrictions that all PDN connections for a given APN and UE shall use the
same access network and shall all be moved to a new access network during
handovers.
\- If an additional PDN connection to the same APN occurs, and an existing PDN
connection to that APN exists, the same PDN GW shall be selected.
\- Multiple PDN connections to different APNs may use different access
networks. The UE selects the access network where to route a specific PDN
connection based on user preferences and operator\'s policies.
\- A UE that is capable of routing different simultaneously active PDN
connections through different access networks can do so if the UE is
authorized by subscription to access each of the involved PDNs and each of the
involved access networks.
\- The access networks the UE can stay simultaneously connected with shall
include no more than one 3GPP access and one and only one non-3GPP access.
NOTE: During the handover procedure the UE moves the PDN connections one-by-
one, but the selective handover of the PDN connections to the same APN is not
supported.
Once a specific IP mobility protocol is selected during initial attach for a
specific non-3GPP access, it is not possible for the UE to use different
mobility protocols for any of the PDNs that it obtains connectivity on the
same non-3GPP access after initial attach. It is not possible for a UE that is
connected to multiple PDNs over a 3GPP access to perform a handover to a
non-3GPP access and then use different mobility protocols for the various PDNs
that it connected with on the same non-3GPP access.
For the purpose of using MAPCON, the UE shall try to simultaneously connect to
different APNs through different access networks only if the home network
supports such simultaneous connectivity. The UE determines that the network
supports such simultaneous connectivity over multiple accesses if the UE is
provisioned with or has received per-APN inter-system routing policies (see
clause 4.8.2.1) from the home network.
## 4.13 Detach principles
When a UE is attached to Evolved Packet Core via multiple access systems, the
following principles shall apply during the detach procedure:
\- A UE that is detaching from the Evolved Packet Core (e.g. a UE that is
powering off) shall perform the UE initiated detach procedure on each of the
access systems through which the UE is attached to Evolved Packet Core.
\- A UE that is detaching from a specific access system and wants to preserve
all or a subset of the active PDN connections that use that access system
shall initiate UE initiated PDN disconnection procedure for each of the PDN
connection which is not required to be preserved. The UE then shall initiate
the applicable handover procedure to transfer to the access system through
which the UE remains attached to the Evolved Packet Core each of the PDN
connections to be preserved.
\- When HSS initiates the detach procedure to delete the UE from the Evolved
Packet Core (e.g. due to subscription expiry, etc), HSS/AAA initiated detach
procedure should be performed towards each node registered for the UE.

## 5.2 Initial E-UTRAN Attach with PMIP-based S5 or S8
This clause is related to the case when the UE powers-on in the LTE network
with PMIP-based S5 or S8 interface and includes the case of roamers from a GTP
network into a PMIPv6 network when PMIP-based S5 is used to connect the
Serving GW and the PDN GW of the visited PLMN. Proxy Mobile IP version 6 is
used on S5 or S8 interface. It is assumed that the MAG is collocated with the
Serving GW for the PMIPv6 procedure between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.
When only GTP-based S5 or S8 connections are established for roamers from a
GTP network into a PMIPv6 network the procedure as described in TS 23.401 [4]
applies.
Figure 5.2-1: Initial E-UTRAN attach with PMIP-based S5 or S8
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
This procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over E-UTRAN
with PMIP based S5 or S8 when the UE already has active PDN connections only
over a non-3GPP access network and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN
connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 5.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
A.1) The Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination
Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The S‑GW provides
information to enable the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP‑CAN session. This
results in the removal of the Gateway Control session in S‑GW.
A.2) The Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, lifetime=0) message
to the PDN GW. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The lifetime field indicates that
the message is used to de-register the UE at the PDN-GW.
A.3) The PDN GW initiates the IP CAN session Termination Procedure with the
PDN GW as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to
enable the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP‑CAN session. This results in the
removal of IP‑CAN session related information in the PCRF and in the PDN‑GW.
A.4) The PDN GW responds to the Serving GW with the result of the
deregistration with Proxy Binding Update Acknowledgement message.
Steps between A.4 and B.1 and steps between B.4 and C.1 are described in TS
23.401 [4], clause 5.3.2.1.
Steps B.1 to B.4 are the same as Steps A.1 through A.4.
C.1) The Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Establishment
Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The S‑GW provides the
information to the PCRF to correctly associate it with the IP‑CAN session to
be established in step C.3 and also to convey subscription related parameters
to the PCRF that have been received between steps (B) and (C) from the MME,
including the APN-AMBR and Default Bearer QoS. The Serving GW provides in
addition the UE Location Information IE and user CSG information, if
available. The Serving GW also indicates its support for the extended TFT
filter format.
In the case of Emergency Attach, if the IMSI provided by the MME to the S‑GW
in step before C.1 is marked as unauthenticated, the SGW provides this IMSI
marked as unauthenticated to the PCRF in the GW Control Session Establishment.
This IMSI marked as unauthenticated is provided by the PCRF to the PDN GW in
step C.3. In this case, the IMEI is used as the UE Identity in the message to
the PCRF.
C.2) The Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, Lifetime, Access
Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, UE
Address Info Additional Parameters, Charging Characteristics) to the PDN GW in
order to establish the new registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom
the message is being sent. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value
in the case of a registration. Access Technology Type is set to indicate 3GPP
access to EPS. Handover Indication option is set to indicate attachment over a
new interface as no Handover indication is received from the MME. The APN may
be necessary to differentiate the intended PDN from the other PDNs supported
by the same PDN GW. The Serving GW includes the EPS bearer identity of the
default bearer received from the MME if multiple PDN connections to the same
APN are supported. The optional Additional Parameters may contain information,
for example, protocol configuration options. The UE Address Info IE is used to
request an IPv6 prefix, IPv4 address, or both IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix.
Based on PDN Type parameter received in the Create Session Request, Serving GW
includes request for IPv4 Home Address (PDN Type set to IPv4), or IPv6 Home
Network Prefix (PDN type set to IPv6) or both IPv4 home address and IPv6 HNP
(PDN type set to IPv4v6) in the PBU as specified in PMIPv6 specification, RFC
5213 [8]). In the case of a subscribed IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix
provided by the MME in the PDN Address Allocation IE, the UE Address Info IE
is set to the subscribed IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix.
In case of Emergency Attach, if IMSI is not provided by MME to SGW or the IMSI
provided is marked as unauthenticated, the S‑GW creates MN NAI based on IMEI
as specified in TS 23.003 [16].
NOTE 1: Any time after Step C.1 is initiated, Step C.2 can be initiated by
MAG.
C.3) The PDN GW initiates the IP CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the
PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the
PCRF used to identify the session and associate Gateway Control Sessions
established in step C.1 correctly. The PDN GW also provide the PCRF with the
UE IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix newly assigned as a result of step C.2,
which might lead the PCRF to update the QoS rules to include this IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix. The PCRF creates IP‑CAN session related information and
responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules UE Location Information IE, user CSG
information, if received from the Serving GW, and event triggers.
In case of Emergency Attach, if MN NAI based on IMEI is received in the PBU
message in step C.2, the PDN GW uses the IMEI as a UE Identity in the message
to the PCRF.
C.4) The PDN GW responds with a PMIPv6 Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI,
Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional
Parameters) message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI
sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration the
binding will remain valid. The PDN GW takes into account the request from
Serving GW and the policies of operator when the PDN GW allocates the UE
Address Info. The UE address info returns the newly assigned IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix assigned to the UE, if one was requested in the PMIPv6
Proxy Binding Update message. IP address allocation by the PDN-GW is as stated
in clause 4.7.1. \"IP Address Allocation with PMIP-based S5/S8\". If the PDN
GW sends the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the Proxy
Binding Acknowledgement message, the UE IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW is
not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures to the UE. In
this case, the Serving GW does not forward the IPv4 address assigned by the
PDN GW to the MME, but sets the PDN Address to 0.0.0.0 in the message to the
MME. If a valid IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix received in the Proxy Binding
Update message, the PDN GW validates the addresses and returns it the UE
Address Info IE of the Proxy Binding Acknowledge message. If the corresponding
Proxy Binding Update contains the EPS bearer identity, the PDN GW shall
acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. The
Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging correlation
purposes. The optional Additional Parameter information element may contain
other information, including for example Protocol Configuration Options.
NOTE 2: In case the QoS rules have changed, the PCRF updates the QoS rules at
the S‑GW by initiating the GW Control Session Modification Procedure, as
specified in TS 23.203 [19].
NOTE 3: QoS rules may lead to establishment of new dedicated bearers along
with the default bearer.
C.5) The PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure
specified in TS 23.203 [19] by sending a message with the QoS rules and Event
Trigger information to the S‑GW. The PCRF also indicates whether the extended
TFT filter format is to be supported for the PDN connection.
NOTE 4 The Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple
PDN connections to the same APN or not.
After steps C.1-C.5 the procedure continues as it is defined in clause 5.3.2
in TS 23.401 [4] with the exception that the steps in block D are not
performed.
## 5.3 Detach for PMIP-based S5/S8
The procedure in this clause provides the PMIPv6-based S5/S8 variants to all
E-UTRAN Detach Procedures, including UE, MME or HSS initiated detach procedure
(TS 23.401 [4] clause 5.3.8).
In case of detach, all the bearers at the Serving GW are terminated. Further,
the IP CAN session for the UE in the PDN GW is also terminated.
If the UE is connected to both E-UTRAN and a non-3GPP access before the UE
triggers detach on E-UTRAN, and the UE wants to preserve all or a subset of
the active PDN connections routed over E-UTRAN system, a UE initiated PDN
disconnection procedure shall be performed for each of the PDN connections
that are not required to be preserved. The UE then shall initiate the
applicable handover procedure to transfer to the access system through which
the UE remains attached to the Evolved Packet Core each of the PDN connections
to be preserved.
Figure 5.3-1: E-UTRAN Detach Procedure for PMIP-based S5/S8
NOTE: When multiple PDN connections are active a part of this procedure
including steps A.1 to A.4 are repeated for each PDN connection of the UE.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in Figure
5.3-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy
may be statically configured with the gateway.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.
A.1) The Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The S‑GW provides
information to enable the PCRF to unambiguously identify the IP‑CAN session
corresponding to the Gateway Control Session and indicates User Location
Information and/or UE Time Zone Information to the PCRF as an Event Report if
the corresponding event trigger is set. This results in the removal of the
Gateway Control session in S‑GW.
A.2) The Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, APN, lifetime=0)
message to the PDN GW to release the PDN connection of the UE at the PDN-GW.
If only one PDN connection per APN is supported then the MN NAI and the APN
identify the PDN connection of the UE. If multiple PDN connections per APN are
supported then the MN NAI, the APN and the EPS bearer identity of the default
bearer identify the PDN connection of the UE. The lifetime field indicates
that the message is used to release the PDN connection of the UE at the PDN-
GW.
A.3) The PDN GW initiates the PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides
information to enable the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP‑CAN session. This
results in the removal of IP-CAN session related information in the PCRF and
in the PDN GW.
A.4) The PDN GW responds to the Serving GW with the result of the PDN
connection release with Proxy Binding Update Acknowledgement
## 5.4 Dedicated Bearer Procedures for E-UTRAN Access with PMIP-based S5/S8
### 5.4.1 General
The procedure given in Figure 5.4.1-1 applies to all dedicated resource
allocation operations for E-UTRAN which are triggered by PCRF, with the only
exception of MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure which is
covered in clause 5.4.5.3 The procedures initiated by the S‑GW in the E-UTRAN
differ for each case.
The procedure described in Figure 5.4.1-1 shows only the steps, due to PMIP
based S5/S8, that are different from the GTP variant of the procedure given in
TS 23.401 [4].
Figure 5.4.1-1: Dedicated Resource Allocation Procedure, UE in Active Mode
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
If dynamic policy provision is not deployed, the steps shown in the figure are
not taken. Instead, a configured static policy may be applied.
A.1) The PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure
specified in TS 23.203 [19] by sending a message with the QoS rules and Event
Trigger information to the S‑GW.
Steps between A.1 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401 [4], clauses 5.4.{1, 2.1,
3, 4.1}.
NOTE 1: For a PMIP‑based S5/S8, before procedure steps (step 3 of TS 23.401
[4], clause 5.4.1), the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS policy)
message to the S‑GW and not to the P‑GW as done for GTP‑based S5/S8. The S‑GW
uses this QoS policy to determine that traffic flow(s) shall be aggregated to
or removed from an active bearer. The S‑GW generates the TFT and updates the
EPS Bearer QoS to match the aggregated set of traffic flows. It is possible
that the S-GW bearer binding function will result in the modification,
creation or removal of bearers at this point. For modification, the S‑GW sends
an Update Bearer Request (PTI, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, TFT)
message to the MME. For creation of a dedicated bearer, the S-GW sends a
Create Bearer message and for removal, the S-GW sends a Delete Bearer Request.
B.1) The Serving GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested QoS Policy
Rules Provision could be enforced or not thus completing the GW Control and
QoS Rules Provision procedure started in step A.1. The Serving GW indicates
User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone Information to the PCRF as an
Event Report if the corresponding event trigger is set.
B.2) The PCRF initiates the PCC Rules Provision Procedure as specified in TS
23.203 [19]. The PCRF provides updated PCC rules to the PCEF for enforcement
by means of an PCC Rules Provision procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19].
NOTE 2: Step B.2 may occur before step A.1 or performed in parallel with steps
A.1‑B.1 if acknowledgement of resource allocation is not required to update
PCC rules in PCEF. For details please refer to TS 23.203 [19].
Interactions between PCRF initiated dedicated bearer procedure and handover
are described in clauses 5.7.1 and 5.7.2.
### 5.4.2 Dedicated Bearer Activation
When the QoS Policy rules provided by the PCRF to the Serving Gateway in Step
A.1 of Figure 5.4.1-1 above result in the Serving Gateway to decide to
activate a dedicated bearer, this procedure is applied.
The procedure depicted in Figure 5.4.1-1 applies for this case. On receiving
message A.1, the Serving GW decides that a new bearer needs to be activated,
the Serving GW uses this QoS policy to assign the EPS Bearer QoS, i.e., it
assigns the values to the bearer level QoS parameters (excluding AMBR); see TS
23.401 [4] clause 4.7.3. The Serving GW follows the procedure shown in TS
23.401 [4], clause 5.4.1 by sending a Create Bearer Request message (EPS
Bearer QoS, TFT, S1 TEID) to the MME.
The message descriptions for A.1, B.1 and B.2 in clause 5.4.1 apply to this
case as well. The steps between A.1 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401 [4],
clause 5.4.1.
### 5.4.3 Bearer Modification with Bearer QoS Update
#### 5.4.3.1 PCC Initiated Bearer Modification with Bearer QoS Update
When the QoS Policy rules provided by the PCRF to the Serving Gateway in step
A.1 of Figure 5.4.1-1 above results in the Serving Gateway to decide to modify
the QoS of an already existing bearer, this procedure is applied. QoS
modification may result in a bearer modification in the E-UTRAN access.
The procedure depicted in Figure 5.4.1-1 applies to this case as well. On
receiving message A.1, the Serving GW uses this QoS policy to determine that
traffic flow(s) shall be aggregated to or removed from an active bearer. The
Serving GW generates the TFT and updates the EPS Bearer QoS to match the
aggregated set of traffic flows. The Serving GW then follows the procedure
shown in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.2 by sending the Update Bearer Request (EPS
Bearer QoS, TFT) message to the MME.
The message descriptions for A.1, B.1 and B.2 in clause 5.4.1 apply to this
procedure as well. The steps between A.1 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401
[4], clause 5.4.2.1.
#### 5.4.3.2 HSS-Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification
The HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification for a PMIP-based S5/S8 is
depicted in Figure 5.4.3.2-1.
Figure 5.4.3.2-1: HSS-initiated Subscribed QoS Modification
A.1. The Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Request
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The S‑GW provides the
updated default EPS Bearer QoS for the default bearer to the PCRF and the PCRF
responds with updated QoS rules. The PCRF makes a PCC decision as a result of
the Gateway Control and QoS policy request and provides the updated QoS Rules
to the Serving GW.
A.2. The PCRF initiates the PCC Rules Provision Procedure with the PDN GW as
specified in TS 23.203 [19] to updates the rules in the PDN GW.
After Step A.1, the Serving GW follows the procedure shown in TS 23.401 [4],
clause 5.4.2.1 by sending the Update Bearer Request message to the MME. The
procedure is completed when the Serving GW receives a Update Bearer Response
from the MME in Step 10 of TS 23.401 [4] clause 5.4.2.1.
B.1. The Serving GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested QoS Policy
Rules Provision could be enforced or not and thus completing the GW Control
and QoS Rules Provision procedure started in step A.1.
B.2. The PCRF executes the Policy and Charging Rules Provision Procedure as
specified in TS 23.203 [19] to update the PCC rules in the PDN GW.
NOTE: Step B.2 may be performed in parallel with steps A.1‑B.1 if
acknowledgement of resource allocation is not required at the PCRF to update
PCC rules in PCEF. For details please refer to TS 23.203 [19].
### 5.4.4 Dedicated Bearer Modification without Bearer QoS Update
When the QoS Policy rules provided by the PCRF to the Serving Gateway in step
A.1 of figure 5.4.1-1 above results in the Serving Gateway to decide to only
update the set of TFTs corresponding to an already existing dedicated bearer,
this procedure is applied.
NOTE: If neither the contents of the TFT nor the APN-AMBR are modified, this
procedure does not apply.
The procedure depicted in Figure 5.4.1-1 applies to this case as well. On
receiving message A.1, the Serving GW uses this QoS policy to determine that
traffic flow(s) shall be aggregated to or removed from an active dedicated
bearer. The Serving GW generates the TFT and determines that no update of the
EPS Bearer QoS is needed. The Serving GW then follows the procedure shown in
TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.3 by sending the Update Bearer Request (TFT) message
to the MME.
The message descriptions for A.1, B.1 and B.2 in clause 5.4.1 apply to this
procedure as well. The steps between A.1 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401
[4], clause 5.4.3.
### 5.4.5 Dedicated Bearer Deactivation
#### 5.4.5.1 PCC-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation
When the QoS Policy rules provided by the PCRF to the Serving Gateway in step
A.1 of figure 5.4.1-1 above results in the Serving Gateway to decide to
deactivate an existing dedicated bearer, this procedure is applied.
The procedure depicted in Figure 5.4.1-1 applies to this case as well. On
receiving message A.1, the Serving GW uses this QoS policy to determine that a
dedicated bearer needs to be deactivated, the Serving GW follows the procedure
shown in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4 by sending the Delete Bearer Request
message to the MME. If the S‑GW determines that the default bearer needs to be
deactivated, the S‑GW follows the procedure specified in clause 5.6.2.1.
The message descriptions for A.1, B.1 and B.2 in clause 5.4.1 apply to this
procedure as well. The steps between A.1 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401
[4], clause 5.4.4.1.
#### 5.4.5.2 Void
#### 5.4.5.3 MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation
This clause contains the procedure steps that vary between the GTP and PMIP
variant of S5 and S8 for the procedure defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause
5.4.4.2 for -MME initiated dedicated bearer deactivation.
Figure 5.4.5.3-1: MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in Figure 5.4.5.3-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
Before Step A.1, the procedure shown in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.2 is
followed and the Serving GW receives a Delete Bearer Command message from the
MME.
A.1) The Serving GW decides to deactivate the bearers and initiates the
Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Request Procedure with the PCRF as
specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Serving GW informs the PCRF about the deleted
QoS Rules and indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone
Information to the PCRF as an Event Report if the corresponding event trigger
is set.
A.2) The PCRF initiates the PCC Rules Provision Procedure with the PDN GW as
specified in TS 23.203 [19] to updates the rules in the PDN GW. The PCC rules
provide the PDN GW with information required to enforce the remaining
dedicated resource allocation policy, after removing PCC rules corresponding
to the QoS rules deactivated by step A.1.
After step A.1, the Serving GW follows the procedure shown in TS 23.401 [4],
clause 5.4.4.2 by sending the Delete Bearer Request message to the MME. The
Serving GW does not need to wait for step A.1 to complete to proceed with the
deactivation of bearers with the MME. The procedure is completed when the
Serving GW receives a Delete Bearer Response from the MME in Step 8 of TS
23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.2.
## 5.5 UE-initiated Resource Request and Release
This clause is related to the case when UE-initiated resource request and
release is supported, and it is utilized for the PMIP-based S5/S8 traffic flow
aggregates.
In the non-roaming case, vPCRF will not be involved.
Figure 5.5-1: UE-initiated resource request/release with PMIP-based S5/S8
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in Figure 5.5-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
A.1. The Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Request
Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Serving GW provides the content
of the Traffic Aggregate Description (TAD) and the requested QoS change to the
PCRF as an Event Report. The PCRF makes a PCC decision as a result of the
Gateway Control and QoS policy request and provides the updated QoS Rules to
the Serving GW. The PCRF declaration of support for the extended TFT filter
format is a precondition for the Serving GW accepting and forwarding TAD
filters that use the extended TFT filter format to the PCRF.
Steps between A.1 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401 [4], clauses 5.4.1, 5.4.2
and 5.4.3 for resource allocation/modification or clause 5.4.4.1 for resource
deactivation. Based on the QoS policy rules, the Serving GW decides whether to
initiate a dedicated resource allocation activation or dedicated resource
allocation modification (with or without QoS update).The Serving GW uses this
QoS policy to assign the EPS Bearer QoS, i.e. it assigns the values to the
bearer level QoS parameters (excluding AMBR); see clause 4.7.3 of TS 23.401
[4] and sends the appropriate message to the MME.
B.1. The Serving GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested QoS Policy
Rules Provision could be enforced or not and indicates User Location
Information and/or UE Time Zone Information to the PCRF as an Event Report if
the corresponding event trigger is set. This completes the GW Control and QoS
Rules Provision procedure started in step A.1.
B.2. The PCRF initiates the Policy and Charging Rules Provision Procedure as
specified in TS 23.203 [19] to update the PCC rules in the PDN GW.
NOTE: Step B.2 may be performed in parallel with Steps A.1‑B1 if
acknowledgement of resource allocation is not required at the PCRF to update
PCC rules in PCEF. For details please refer to TS 23.203 [19].
## 5.6 Multiple PDN Support with PMIP-based S5/S8
### 5.6.1 UE requested PDN connectivity
The UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for E-UTRAN is depicted in figure
5.6.1-1. The procedure allows the UE to request for connectivity to an
additional PDN over E-UTRAN, including allocation of a default bearer, when
the UE already has active PDN connections over E-UTRAN. This procedure is also
used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN over E-UTRAN when the UE
is simultaneously connected to E-UTRAN and a non-3GPP access, and the UE
already has active PDN connections over both the accesses. In this procedure,
the UE is assumed to be in active mode. Proxy Mobile IP is used on S5 or S8
interface. It is assumed that the MAG is collocated with the Serving GW for
the PMIPv6 procedure between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.
When only GTP-based S5 or S8 connections are established for roamers from a
PMIP network into a GTP network the procedure as described in clause 5.10.2 of
TS 23.401 [4] applies.
When PMIP-based S5/S8 is used the EPS bearer identities of the default bearers
are used to differentiate the PDN connections for a given APN, i.e. the MN-ID,
the APN and the EPS bearer identity of the default EPS bearer identify the PDN
connection. The Serving Gateway shall include the EPS bearer identity of the
default EPS bearer if multiple PDN connections per APN are supported in the
Proxy Binding Update messages. If the EPS bearer identity is included in a
Proxy Binding Update, the PDN GW shall explicitly indicate the support of
multiple PDN connections to a given APN. The MME is configured if the Serving
GWs in its PLMN support multiple PDN connections to the same APN over PMIP
based S5/S8. If the Serving GW does not support multiple PDN connections to
the same APN and the UE requests a PDN connection for an APN for which the UE
already has an active PDN connection, the MME shall reject the PDN
connectivity request. If the PDN GW does not support multiple PDN connections
for a given APN, and the Serving GW supports multiple PDN connections to the
same APN and the UE requests a PDN connection for an APN for which the UE
already has an active PDN connection, the Serving GW shall reject the PDN
connectivity request.
The procedure is also used for the re-establishment of existing PDN
connectivity after the UE performed the handover from non-3GPP accesses for
the first PDN connection by the Attach procedure. The UE triggers the re-
establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the handover by providing a
Request Type indicating \"Handover\" as specified in TS 23.401 [4].
Figure 5.6.1-1: UE requested PDN connectivity with PMIP-based S5 or S8
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 5.6.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
For UE request additional PDN connectivity to PDNs when connected to 3GPP
access network with PMIP-based S5 or S8, the IP address is not available after
step A1, steps in (Alt A) are performed after step A.1, excluding steps in
(Alt B). The step in (C) is performed only when the UE establishes additional
PDN connectivity with a PDN it is not already connected to, excluding step
(D).
For re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed the
handover from non-3GPP accesses, the steps shown in (Alt A) and (Alt B) are
mutually exclusive in this procedure, i.e. either steps A.2-A.4 are executed
or steps B.1-B.3. In order to execute the alternative (Alt B), the IP address
of the UE needs to be available after step A.1. The IP Address(es) of the UE
is received in step A.1, if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. If
multiple PDN connections to same APN are supported by the Serving GW, (Alt A)
shall be used in this procedure.
In case the IP address(es) of the UE is available after step A.1, (Alt B)
provides lower jitter for dual radio handovers. In case the IP address(es) of
the UE is not available after step A.1, (Alt A) shall be used.
For re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed the
handover from non-3GPP accesses, the following also applies:
\- In step A.2/B.1 the Serving GW sets the Handover Indicator to indicate
handoff between two different interfaces of the UE.
\- The step in (D) and step B.2 are performed only when the UE re-establishes
PDN connectivity after a handover. The steps in (D) correspond to the PCEF-
Initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19].
\- In step A.4/B.3, the UE Address Info shall contain the IP address the UE
obtained during PDN connectivity establishment for this PDN over the non-3GPP
access. The PDN GW also includes the Charging ID for the PDN connection in the
Proxy binding acknowledgement. For the case of additional PDN connectivity
with a PDN, the PDN-GW generates a Charging Id for the PDN connection. For the
case of re-establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the UE performed a
handover from non-3GPP access, the PDN GW reuses the Charging Id previously
assigned to the PDN connection if the source access is a PMIP-based access or
to the Default Bearer if the source access is GTP-based.
The steps A.1‑A.4 correspond to steps C.1‑C.4 in Figure 5.2-1.
The steps B.1-B.3 correspond to steps A.2, A.3b, A.4 in Figure 5.6.1-1.
### 5.6.2 PDN Disconnection
#### 5.6.2.1 UE, MME or S‑GW initiated PDN Disconnection
When GTP-based S5 or S8 is used the procedure described in clause 5.10.3 of TS
23.401 [4] applies for the UE or MME initiated PDN disconnection. The PMIP
variant of this procedure is specified below. In addition, if the default
bearer belonging to a PDN connection is to be deactivated by the S‑GW, e.g.
due to un-successful modification of QoS of default bearer that was triggered
by PCRF interaction, the S‑GW deactivates all bearers belonging to the PDN
connection using the following procedure.
Figure 5.6.2-1: UE, MME or S‑GW initiated PDN disconnection Procedure for
PMIP-based S5/S8
Steps A.1 to A.4 are described in clause 5.3. For the case of S‑GW initiated
PDN disconnection, which corresponds to PDN GW initiated bearer deactivation
procedure of clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [4], the procedure starts from step
A.1 and there are no steps corresponding to box (B) of figure 5.4.4.1-1 of TS
23.401 [4].
#### 5.6.2.2 PDN-GW-initiated PDN Disconnection
The default bearer and all the dedicated resource allocations associated with
the PDN address are released in this procedure.
Figure 5.6.2.2-1: PDN GW initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure for PMIP-based
S5/S8
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 5.6.2.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
A.1. The PDN GW sends a Binding Revocation Indication (PDN address) message to
the Serving GW.
Steps between A and B are described in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [4], using
the indication that all bearers belonging to the given PDN address shall be
released.
B.1. The Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The S‑GW provides the
information to enable the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP‑CAN session and
indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone Information to the
PCRF as an Event Report if the corresponding event trigger is set. This
results in the removal of the Gateway Control session in S‑GW.
B.2. The Serving GW returns a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to
the PDN GW.
NOTE: Step B.2 may occur before steps B.1 since the Serving GW need not wait
for terminating the GW Control Session with the PCRF before acknowledging the
Binding Revocation.
## 5.7 Handover and Tracking area Update Procedures for PMIP-based S5/S8
Interface
### 5.7.0 Intra-LTE TAU and Inter-eNodeB Handover without Serving GW
Relocation
This clause contains the procedure steps that vary between the GTP and PMIP
variant of S5 and S8 for the TAU with MME without Serving GW change procedure
defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.3.2 as well as Inter-eNodeB Handover
without Servig GW change procedures as described in TS 23.401 [4], clauses
5.5.1.1.2 and 5.5.1.2.2.
The procedure is shown in Figure 5.7.2-1. The parameters to be provided to the
PGW, as described in TS 23.401 [4], are sent by the Serving GW via the PCRF to
the PGW.
### 5.7.1 Intra-LTE TAU and Inter-eNodeB Handover with Serving GW Relocation
This clause contains the procedure steps that vary between the GTP and PMIP
variant of S5 and S8 for the TAU with MME and Serving GW change procedure
defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.3.1 as well as Inter-eNodeB Handover with
CN Node Relocation described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.5.1.2.
In case of a Serving GW relocation, the target Serving GW must establish a
Gateway Control Session with the PCRF to perform policy controlled functions
such as Bearer-Binding. The source Serving GW relinquishes its Gateway Control
Session with the PCRF in step B.
Figure 5.7.1-1: Intra-LTE and Inter-eNodeB Handover with Serving GW Relocation
This procedure concerns both the non-roaming (S5) as in Figure 4.2.1-1 and
roaming case (S8) as in Figure 4.2.1-2. In the roaming case, the vPCRF in the
VPLMN forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF in the HPLMN. In
the case of Local Breakout as in Figure 4.2.3-4, the vPCRF also forwards
messages sent between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in Figure 5.7.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
A.1) The Target Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Establishment
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. As part of the
procedure the Serving GW informs the PCRF of the RAT type, UE Location
Information IE and the user CSG information, if available. The PCRF sends
information to the Serving GW enabling bearer binding and other behaviour. The
Target Serving GW checks whether the QoS rules provided by the PCRF aligns
with the TFT and Bearer Level QoS of the EPS bearer contexts. If there is a
mismatch, the Target Serving GW initiates appropriate EPS bearer procedures.
NOTE 1: The Target Serving GW preserves the Bearer Binding that have already
been established by the Source Serving GW. To enable this the EPS Bearer ID,
TFT is transferred before Step A as follows: across S10 in Forward Relocation
Request and across S11 in Create Session Request. The Event Triggers indicate
to the Serving GW under what conditions to report events to the PCRF.
NOTE 2: The PCRF provides to the Target Serving GW the QoS rules which were
active at the Source Serving GW before the handover. Any change of the QoS
rules is performed via an additional QoS Rule Provision Procedure after the
handover.
A.2) The PCRF may update the PCC rules at the PDN GW by initiating the PCC
Rules Provision Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PCRF also
notifies the PDN GW of the UE Location Information IE and user CSG information
(if this has been received from the Serving GW preceding step A.1).
A.3) The new Serving GW performs a PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI,
Lifetime, Access Technology Type option, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic,
_Additional Parameters_) message in order to re-establish the user plane as a
result of the Serving GW relocation. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the
message is being sent. Within Access Technology Type option an indication for
RAT (E-UTRAN) type is set; an indication for handover between MAGs for the
same interface is also set. If multiple PDN connections for the given APN are
supported by the Serving GW then the APN and the EPS bearer identity of the
default bearer disambiguates which PDN connection this message refers to,
otherwise the APN itself identifies the PDN connection of the UE. The
additional parameters may include protocol configuration options and other
information.
A.4) The PDN GW acknowledges the Binding Update by sending a Proxy Binding Ack
(MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID,
_Additional Parameters_) message to the Serving GW. If the EPS bearer identity
is included in the Proxy Binding Update, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if
multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. A PMIP tunnel is
established at this point between the PDN GW and the Serving GW. The UE
Address Info includes one or more IP addresses. The Additional Parameters may
contain protocol configuration options and other information. The Charging Id
provided is the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection.
NOTE 3: The Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports
multiple PDN connections to the same APN or not.
Steps between A.4 and B.1 are described in TS 23.401 [4], clauses 5.3.3.1 and
5.5.1.
B.1) The old Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Serving GW ceases
to perform Bearer Binding and associated policy controlled functions.
Procedures on the MME for X2 and S1 handover are described in clause 5.5 of TS
23.401 [4]. If the MME receives a rejection to an S1 interface procedure (e.g.
EPS bearer(s) request) from the eNodeB with an indication that an X2/S1
handover is in progress and if during the handover procedure the MME detects
that the Serving GW or/and the MME needs be relocated, the MME rejects any EPS
bearer(s) request received since handover procedure started and includes an
indication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover
procedure in progress.
For PMIP based S5/S8, if dynamic PCC is deployed and with Serving GW
relocation, when the Source Serving GW receives an indication from the MME
that the PCRF initiated dedicated bearer procedure was temporarily rejected
due to handover, the Source Serving GW starts a locally configured guard
timer. The Source Serving GW shall re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number
of times, at expiry of the guard timer or abort the procedure if it determines
that Serving GW is relocated based on receiving the Delete Session request
message from the MME.
### 5.7.2 TAU/RAU or Handover between GERAN A/Gb Mode or UTRAN Iu Mode and
E-UTRAN
In case of inter-RAT TAU/RAU or handovers, the Serving GW may or may not be
relocated. The PMIP based S5/S8 variants procedure steps for inter-RAT TAU/RAU
or handover without Serving GW relocation are shown in Figure 5.7.2-1 and
those corresponding to a change of Serving GW are shown in Figure 5.7.2-2.
The procedures in this clause correspond to the following Figures in TS 23.401
[4]:
\- Figure 5.3.3.2-1 [UTRAN Iu mode to E-UTRAN] Tracking Area Update.
\- Figure 5.3.3.3-1E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN RA Update.
\- Figure 5.3.3.6-1 E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Routeing Area Update.
\- Figure 5.5.2.1.3-1: E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT HO, execution phase.
\- Figure 5.5.2.2.3-1: UTRAN Iu mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO, execution phase.
\- Figure 5.5.2.3.3-1: E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT HO, execution
phase.
\- Figure 5.5.2.4.3-1: GERAN A/Gb mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO, execution
phase.
In TS 23.401 [4], the clauses corresponding to Figure 5.7.2-1 and Figure
5.7.2-2 cover both the case of Serving GW relocation and no Serving GW
relocation. In case of no Serving GW relocation, Steps (A) in the above
figures are between the un-changed Serving GW and the PCRF and the Steps (B)
in those figures do not apply, as shown in Figure 5.7.2-1. In case of Serving
GW relocation, Steps (A) in the above figure are between the target Serving GW
and the PCRF and the Steps (B) is between the source Serving GW and the PCRF,
as shown in Figure 5.7.2-2.
In case of no Serving GW relocation, the S‑GW signals the change of RAT to the
PCRF. In addition, if the Serving GW has received the User Location
Information IE or the user CSG information from the MME, this information is
also sent to the PCRF. If PCC rules provided to the PDN-GW have changed, the
PCRF updates these rules at the PDN-GW. The PCRF sends the RAT Type change or
User Location Information and user CSG information, if received from the
Serving- GW, to the PDN GW.
The user plane already exists between the Serving GW and the PDN GW and
remains unchanged. In case of RAU or handover to 2G/3G, user plane routing is
assumed to proceed over the S4 interface towards the S2/S3 SGSN. When an
inter-RAT TAU occurs, the enhanced packet core may signal this event to the
PDN GW, for example to inform the PDN GW of a RAT type change. In the case of
a PMIP-based S5 and S8, a Modify Bearer Request is not sent from the Serving
GW to the PDN GW. Instead, the PCRF in the HPLMN reports the change of event.
The PCRF signals any change in the policy resulting from the event to the PDN
GW, provisioning updated policy and charging rules.
In case dynamic PCC is not deployed, a change of RAT type will not be
signalled to the PDN GW using PMIP based S5/S8 interfaces, if no change of
Serving GW has occurred.
Figure 5.7.2-1: Inter-RAT TAU/RAU or Handover without Serving GW relocation
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in Figure 5.7.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
A.1) The Serving GW informs the PCRF about the change of RAT type and UE
Location Information IE and user CSG information (if this has been received
from the MME preceding step A) by initiating the Gateway Control and QoS
Policy Rules Request Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
A.2) The PCRF updates the PCC rules at the PDN GW by initiating the PCC Rules
Provision Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19] if the PCC rules have
changed based on the RAT type reported by the Serving GW in step A.1. Further,
the hPCRF notifies the PDN GW of the change in RAT and the UE Location
Information IE and user CSG information (if this has been received from the
Serving GW preceding step A.1).
Step A.2 may be initiated before A.1 completes.
If dynamic PCC is deployed and during the handover with MME relocation without
serving GW relocation, when the Serving GW receives an indication from the MME
that the PCRF initiated dedicated bearer procedure was temporarily rejected
due to handover, the Serving GW starts a locally configured guard timer. The
Serving GW shall re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of times, when it
either detects that the handover is completed or failed using message
reception or at expiry of the guard timer.
The following procedure describes inter-RAT TAU/RAU or Handover in the case of
Serving Gateway relocation for PMIP-based S5/S8.
Figure 5.7.2-2: Inter-RAT TAU/RAU or Handover with Serving GW Relocation
This procedure concerns both the non-roaming (S5) as in Figure 4.2.1-1 and
roaming case (S8) as in Figure 4.2.1-2. In the roaming case, the vPCRF in the
VPLMN forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF in the HPLMN. In
the case of Local Breakout as in Figure 4.2.3-4, the vPCRF forwards messages
sent between the PDN GW and the hPCRF as well. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps in the
procedure are not applied.
A.1) The Target Serving Gateway initiates a Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19] and
informs the PCRF of the new RAT type, UE Location Information IE and user CSG
information (if this has been received from the MME preceding step A). The
Target Serving GW checks whether the QoS rules provided by the PCRF aligns
with the TFT and Bearer Level QoS of the EPS bearer contexts. If there is a
mismatch, the Target Serving GW initiates appropriate EPS bearer procedures.
NOTE 1: The PCRF provides to the Target Serving GW the QoS rules which were
active at the Source Serving GW before the handover. Any change of the QoS
rules is performed via an additional QoS Rule Provision Procedure after the
handover.
A.2) The PCRF sends an updated policy to the PDN GW by initiating the Policy
and Charging Rules Provision Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. This
contains any effected PCC rules and Event Triggers resulting from the
preceding step that may require enforcement or event reporting to be performed
by the PDN GW. The UE Location Information IE and user CSG information are
also sent to the PDN GW from the PCRF (if this has been received from the
Serving GW preceding step A.1).
A.3) The Target Serving GW sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, Lifetime,
Access Technology Type, APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, _Additional
Parameters_) message in order to re-establish the user plane as a result of
the Serving GW relocation. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the message
is being sent. Access Technology Type is set to indicate 3GPP access to EPS;
an indication for handover between MAGs for the same interface is also set. If
multiple PDN connections for the given APN are supported by the Serving GW
then the APN and the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer disambiguates
which PDN connection this message refers to, otherwise the APN itself
identifies the PDN connection of the UE. The additional parameters may include
protocol configuration options and other information.
A.4) The PDN GW acknowledges the Binding Update by sending a Proxy Binding Ack
(MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID,
_Additional Parameters_) message to the Target Serving GW. If the EPS bearer
identity is included in the Proxy Binding Update the PDN GW shall acknowledge
if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. A PMIP tunnel is
established at this point between the PDN GW and the Target Serving GW. The UE
Address Info includes one or more IP addresses. The Additional Parameters may
contain protocol configuration options and other information. The Charging Id
provided is the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection.
NOTE 2: The Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports
multiple PDN connections to the same APN or not.
Steps between A.4 and B.1 are described in the clauses of TS 23.401 [4],
containing the figures referenced in Figure 5.7.2-1 above.
B.1) The old Serving GW initiates the Gateway Control Session Termination
Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The S‑GW provides
information to enable the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP‑CAN session. This
results in the removal of the Gateway Control session in S‑GW.
## 5.8 ME Identity Check Procedures for PMIP-based S5/S8
ME identity check by the MME in case of PMIP-based S5/S8 is performed as
defined for GTP-based S5/S8, see clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach
procedure) of TS 23.401 [4].
No ME identity check support is specified on the S5/S8 reference point.
## 5.9 UE-triggered Service Request for PMIP-based S5/S8
This clause contains the procedure steps that vary between the GTP and PMIP
variant of S5 and S8 for the UE-triggered Service Request procedure defined in
TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.3.4.1, for the case where the RAT Type reported in the
Service Request has changed compared to the last reported RAT Type.
Figure 5.9-1: UE-triggered Service Request for PMIP-based S5/S8
This procedure concerns both the non-roaming (S5) and roaming case (S8). In
the roaming case, the vPCRF in the VPLMN forwards messages between the Serving
GW and the hPCRF in the HPLMN. In the case of Local Breakout, the vPCRF
forwards messages sent between the PDN GW and the hPCRF as well. In the non-
roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in Figure 5.9-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
A.1) The Serving GW informs the PCRF about the change of RAT type, UE Location
Information IE and user CSG information (if this has been received from the
MME preceding step A) by initiating the Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules
Request Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
A.2) The PCRF updates the PCC rules at the PDN GW by initiating the PCC Rules
Provision Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19] if the PCC rules have
changed based on the RAT type reported by the Serving GW in step A.1. The UE
Location Information IE and user CSG information are also sent to the PDN GW
from the PCRF (if this has been received from the Serving GW preceding step
A.1).
Further, the hPCRF notifies the PDN GW of the change in RAT.
Step A.2 may be initiated before step A.1 completes: Once the hPCRF receives
the event report from the Serving GW as part of step A.1, the hPCRF may
complete step A.1 and initiate step A.2 in any order..
## 5.10 PMIP-based S5/S8 procedures for GERAN/UTRAN over S4
### 5.10.1 General
This clause presents the PMIP-based S5/S8 procedures equivalent to the GTP-
based procedures presented in TS 23.060 [21] for interworking. The differences
required for interpretation of the PMIP-based S5/S8 procedures in other
clauses of this specification are clarified below.
If PCC is not deployed, only default bearers may be provided for UE connection
to a PDN. This is described fully in the PMIP-based S5/S8 procedures referred
to in clause 5.10. Secondary PDP context requests are not supported in this
case.
Bearer-specific parameters sent along S4 are not forwarded to the PDN GW or
PCRF in many cases. Bearers terminate in the Serving GW when PMIP-based S5/S8
has been deployed. Though EPS bearer identifier information is not relevant to
the PCRF or PCEF in these cases, some bearer-oriented parameters must be
forwarded to the PCRF for authorization and so that the PCRF will generate the
correct corresponding PCC rules to send to the PDN GW for enforcement.
### 5.10.2 GPRS procedures that update the PDN GW
Several procedures employing GTP-based S5/S8 includes a \"Modify Bearer\"
exchange, initiated by the Serving GW, responded to by the PDN GW. The
equivalent interaction for a PMIP-based S5/S8 is shown in figure 5.7.2-1.
The following procedures in TS 23.060 [21] will make use of the procedure
shown in this specification, clause 5.7.2 to signal RAT change as determined
by the SGSN. Aside from the new RAT type, no additional parameter must be sent
as an event report by the Serving GW to the PDN GW by means of the PCRF (as
described in TS 23.203 [19]).
The procedure in clause 5.7.2 refers directly to procedures in TS 23.401 [4],
while the procedures described here in support of S4 refer to clauses in TS
23.060 [21]. The following clarifications to the procedure in clause 5.7.2
must be considered to interpret clause 5.7.2:
**\- 6.9.2.2.1a: Serving RNS Relocation Procedure, Combined Hard Handover and
SRNS Relocation\ Procedure, and Combined Cell/URA Update and SRNS Relocation
Procedure using S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (B1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.9.2.2.1a, figure 39b. The
APN AMBR, RAT Type and other parameters defined in clause 6.9.2.2.1a step B
and C are transmitted according to clause 5.7.2, as additional IEs transmitted
between the S-GW, PCRF and P-GW. IEs are returned to the S-GW (insofar as step
A.2 implies a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision procedure as described
in TS 23.203 [19]).
This procedure applies also to 6.9.2.2.3 Combined Cell / URA Updates and SRNS
Relocation Procedure.
**\- 6.9.2.2.5A Enhanced Serving RNS Relocation Procedure Using S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (step B and C) in figure 44b1 and steps B and C in figure
44b2 in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.9.2.2.5A.
**\- 6.12.1A: UE Initiated Service Request Procedure Using S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (B1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.12.1A, figure 50A.
**\- 6.13.1.1.2: Iu mode to A/Gb mode Intra-SGSN Change using S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (A1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.13.1.1.2, figure 52-2.
**\- 6.13.1.2.2: A/Gb mode to Iu mode Intra-SGSN Change using S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (A1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.13.1.2.2, figure 53-2.
**\- 6.13.2.1.2: Iu mode to A/Gb mode Inter-SGSN Change using S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (B1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.13.2.1.2, figure 54-3.
**\- 6.13.2.2.2: A/Gb mode to Iu mode Inter-SGSN Change using S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (B1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.13.2.2.2, figure 55-3.
**\- 8.1.4A Paging response for GPRS Downlink Transfer with no established
User plane on S4**
Steps A.1 and A.2 of the procedure in clause 5.7.2 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (C) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 8.1.4, figure 56b.
### 5.10.3 UE allocated resources
The UE (or the SGSN on behalf of the UE) requests resources in several
procedures in TS 23.060 [21]. The procedure described in clause 5.5 of this
specification provides the PMIP-based S5/S8 describes UE-initiated resource
request, modification and release. This procedure, with the additional
clarification given below, will support the following procedures shown in TS
23.060 [21].
In each case, the SGSN provides a Bearer identifier (the LBI) over S4. The
bearer binding performed by the Serving GW is in this case constrained to
either reject or modify (increase or decrease the resource assigned to) the
indicated bearer. The Serving GW shall not provide a different bearer as a
result of the PDP Context Activation or Modification procedures.
**\- 9.2.2.1A: A PDP Context Activation using S4**
Steps A.1 to A.4 of the procedure in clause 5.6.1 occur instead of the steps
shown in the box (A1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.2.1A, figure 64a. Step A.1
and A.3a include the RAT Type, Default Bearer QoS and APN-AMBR IEs, and other
IEs defined in TS 23.060 [21] clause 9.2.2.1A, step B.
Step A.3b in clause 5.6.1 of this specification (insofar as it implies a
Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision procedure as described in TS 23.203
[19]) returns the IEs to the S-GW, including EPS Bearer QoS and other IEs
defined in TS 23.060 [21] clause 9.2.2.1A, step C.
NOTE: As described in TS 23.060 [21], an S4-based SGSN applies the BCM
\'MS/NW\' whenever the S4 is selected for a certain MS. The Serving GW is not
aware of the BCM.
If the UE requests a PDP context (effectively an additional PDN connection)
for an APN for which the UE already has an active PDN connection, the SGSN
shall reject the PDN connectivity request unless it is configured that the
Serving GW supports multiple PDN connections to the same APN.
**\- 9.2.2.1.1A, Figure 66a: Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure, PDP
Creation Part using S4**
Step A.1 of the procedure in clause 5.5 corresponds to the steps described in
the box (A1) and (A2) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.2.1.1A, figure 66a.
In step A.1, additional IEs are required by the PCRF and PDN GW in order
properly assign QoS rules and prepare the dedicated bearer. The TFT and EPS
Bearer QoS (excluding ARP) IEs are received from the SGSN by the S‑GW over S4.
These parameters are then forward to the PCRF as described in clause 5.5.
**\- 9.2.3.3A: MS-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification Procedure using S4,
Request Part**
The procedure step in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.3A, figure 72c, step B
corresponds with step A.1 of figure 5.5-1 (of this specification).
The Serving GW provides the same information to the PCRF as the PDN GW
provides according to step B in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.3A; this clause
defines the IEs included in step A.1 of clause 5.5.
**\- 9.2.3.3B: MS-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification Procedure using S4,
Execution Part**
The procedure step in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.3B, figure 72d, step A
corresponds with step A.1 of figure 5.5-1 (of this specification). The
following information elements may be sent, depending on the scenario, see TS
23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.3B:
**\- 9.2.3.3C MS-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification Procedure using S4,
Response Part**
The procedure step in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.3A, figure 72c, step C
corresponds with step figure 5.5-1 (of this specification), steps B.1 and B.2,
with one difference - before step B.1, step A of the procedure in TS 23.060
[21], clause 9.2.3.3C occurs. The Serving GW indicates to the PCRF the result
of the resource allocation. This may result in additional interaction with the
PDN GW (see TS 23.203 [19]).
### 5.10.4 Network allocated resources
Network entities may request resources by means of off-path signalling to
support PMIP-based S5/S8. This is defined in clause 5.4.1. All IEs present in
messages sent in the replaced \'boxes\' in procedures in the following list
are sent instead using messages described in this specification. The following
procedures in TS 23.060 [21] employ this procedure:
**\- 9.2.2.3A: Network Requested PDP Context Activation Procedure using S4**
Step A.1 of the procedure in clause 5.4.1 occurs instead of the steps shown in
the box (A1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.2.3A, Figure 69c. Steps B.1 and B.2
of the procedure in clause 5.4.1 correspond to the box (B1).
**\- 9.2.3.1A: SGSN-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification Procedure, Request
Part**
Step A.1 of clause 5.5 occurs instead of the steps inside box (A1) in TS
23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.1A, figure 70c. Figure 5.5-1 refers to TS 23.401 [4]
yet the procedure applies to the SGSN-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification
Procedure using S4 as well.
**\- 9.2.3.1B: SGSN-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification Procedure, Response
Part**
Steps B.1 and B.2 of clause 5.5 occurs instead of the steps inside box (B1) in
TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.1B, figure 70d. Figure 5.5-1 refers to TS 23.401
[4] yet the procedure applies to the SGSN-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification
Procedure using S4 as well.
**\- 9.2.3.2A: PDN GW-Initiated EPS Bearer Modification Procedure**
Step A.1 of the procedure in clause 5.4.1 occurs instead of the steps shown in
the box (A1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.3.2A, Figure 71c.
Steps B.1 and B.2 of the procedure in clause 5.4.1 correspond to the box (A2).
Step B.1 indicates whether the resource allocation was successful. This may
result in additional interaction with the PDN GW (refer to TS 23.203 [19]).
### 5.10.5 UE released resources
The UE may release dedicated resources by means of off-path signalling to
support PMIP-based S5/S8 deployments, as shown in clause 5.5.
**\- 9.2.4.1A.1: MS-and SGSN Initiated PDN connection Deactivation Procedure
using S4**
Steps A.1 to A.4 of the procedure in clause 5.6.2.1 \"UE, MME or S GW
initiated PDN Disconnection\" occur instead of steps shown in the box (A1) in
TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.4.1A.1, figure 74a.
**\- 9.2.4.1A.2: MS- and SGSN Initiated Bearer Deactivation using S4**
Steps A.1, B.1 and B.2 of the procedure in clause 5.5 \"UE-initiated Resource
Request and Release\" procedure occur instead of the steps shown in the box
(A1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.4.1A.2, figure 74b.
### 5.10.6 PDN GW released resources
The PDN GW may release resources by means of off-path signalling to support
PMIP-based S5/S8 deployments as shown in clause 5.4.1. The following
procedures in TS 23.060 [21] employ this procedure:
**\- 9.2.4.3A: PDN GW-Initiated PDP Context Deactivation Procedure using S4**
Step A.1 in clause 5.4.1 corresponds to the steps shown in box (A1) of TS
23.060 [21], clause 9.2.4.3A, figure 77a.
**\- 9.2.4.3B: PDN GW-Initiated PDP Context Deactivation Procedure using S4**
Steps B.1 and B.2 in clause 5.4.1 correspond to the steps in the box (B1) in
TS 23.060 [21], clause 9.2.4.3B, figure 77b.
### 5.10.7 Attach
The GPRS Attach Procedure is supported by the following PMIP-based S5/S8
procedures:
Clause 5.3 is employed instead of box (A) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.5.3A,
figure 22A. clause 5.3 is also used instead of box (B) in TS 23.060 [21],
clause 6.5.3B, figure 22B.
### 5.10.8 Detach interaction using S4
The MS-, SGSN- and HLR-initiated GPRS detach procedures are supported by the
following equivalent PMIP-based S5/S8 procedure:
Clause 5.3 is employed instead of the gray box (A1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause
6.6.3, Figure 25A.
### 5.10.9 Interaction with CGI/SAI reporting using S4
In the Interaction with CGI / SAI reporting using S4 Procedure as depicted in
Figure 15.1.3-3 of TS 23.060 [21], if CGI or SAI changes are considered
relevant to charging, a change notification is sent to the PDN GW. There is no
response to this report. This corresponds to a Location change (CGI/SAI) event
report provided to the PCRF by means of a Gateway Control and QoS Rules
Request, as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. This procedure ensures that the event
is reported to the PDN GW as well.
### 5.10.10 RAU Procedure Support
RAU procedures in TS 23.060 [21] send messages from the S4 SGSN to the S‑GW
and thence to P‑GW using GTPv2. For PMIP-based S5/S8, these exchanges occur
via PCC.
TS 23.203 [19], figure 7.7.3-1 \"Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request\",
depicts the procedure. The BBERF(S‑GW) sends a Gateway Control and QoS Rules
Request message to the PCRF including the APN-AMBR. The PCRF sends a PCC Rules
Provision message to the PDN GW including the APN-AMBR. The PDN GW responds
with an Acknowledge Policy and Charging Rules Provisioning message with the
APN-AMBR to the PCRF. The PCRF responds to the BBERF(S‑GW) with a Gateway
Control and QoS Rules Reply message with the APN‑AMBR parameter. The response
from the PCRF to the BBERF to the initial Gateway Control and QoS Rules
Request message must wait (synchronously) for the completion of the PCC Rules
Provision exchange between the PCRF and PCEF.
**\- 6.9.1.2.2a: Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update and Combined Inter SGSN RA /
LA Update using S4**
Instead of the steps shown in the box (B1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause
6.9.1.2.2a, figure 33b, the procedure described above is employed.
**\- 6.9.2.1a: Routeing Area Update Procedure using S4**
Instead of the steps shown in the box (B1) in TS 23.060 [21], clause 6.9.2.1a,
figure 36b, the procedure described above is employed.
## 5.11 PDN GW initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure
This procedure is initiated by the PDN GW when the UE releases the IPv4
address using DHCPv4 procedure or the lease for the IP address has expired.
The procedure is used to delete the IPv4 address from the PDN connection
context.
Figure 5.11-1: PDN GW initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.1-2) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN
GW and the hPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 5.11-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
1\. The PCEF initiates the Gateway Control Session Modification Procedure with
the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides the information
to enable the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP CAN session.
2\. In case QoS rules have to be modified, e.g. change of SDF filters, the
PCRF initiates a GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure as described in
TS 23.203 [19] to inform the S‑GW of the updated QoS rules.
3\. The S‑GW initiates the \"PDN GW initiated bearer modification without QoS
update\" as described in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.3, between steps (A) and
(B).
4\. The S‑GW informs the PCRF of the success of the QoS rules enforcement,
thus ending the GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure described in TS
23.203 [19].
5\. The PDN GW sends a Binding Revocation Indication (PDN address) message to
the Serving GW to revoke the IPv4 address.
6\. The Serving GW returns a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to the
PDN GW.
## 5.12 Location Change Reporting Procedure for PMIP-based S5/S8
This clause contains the procedure steps that vary between the GTP and PMIP
variant of S5 and S8 for the Location Change Reporting procedure provided in
clause 5.9.2 of TS 23.401 [4]. If the Serving GW has received the User
Location Information IE and/or user CSG information from MME, this event is
reported to the PCRF by means of a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request, as
defined in TS 23.203 [19]. This procedure ensures that the event is reported
to the PDN GW as well.
Figure 5.12-1: Notification of the ECGI/TAI information changes
This procedure concerns both the non-roaming (S5) as in Figure 4.2.1-1 and
roaming case (S8) as in Figure 4.2.1-2. In the roaming case, the vPCRF in the
VPLMN forwards messages between the Serving GW and the hPCRF in the HPLMN. In
the case of Local Breakout as in Figure 4.2.3-4, the vPCRF forwards messages
sent between the PDN GW and the hPCRF as well. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in Figure 5.12-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed and the MME has been requested to report the User Location
Information IE and/or user CSG information changes to the PGW for the UE.
A.1) The Serving GW informs the PCRF about the change User Location
Information IE and/or user CSG information by initiating the Gateway Control
and QoS Policy Rules Request Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
A.2) The hPCRF notifies the PDN GW of the UE Location Information IE and/or
user CSG information by initiating the PCC Rules Provision Procedure as
specified in TS 23.203 [19]
Step A.2 may be initiated before step A.1 completes.
## 5.13 Support for Machine Type Communications (MTC)
### 5.13.1 General
Support for Machine Type Communications (MTC) is described in TS 23.401 [4].
The common procedures and functionalities are only captured in TS 23.401 [4].
### 5.13.2 PDN GW control of overload
The PDN GW may provide mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload
situations. These include the rejection of PDN connection requests from UEs.
When PMIP is used for S5/S8 interface, PDN GW may reject the PDN connection
request (i.e. Proxy Binding Update) with indication that the APN is congested.
In addition the PDN GW may indicate a \"PDN-GW back-off time\" for a specific
APN to the MME in the reject message.
Other PDN GW functionalities and the behaviour of Serving GW/MME/SGSN upon
receiving the reject messages are described in TS 23.401 [4].
### 5.13.3 Usage of low access priority indicator
For PDN connection establishment requests, the SGSN/MME includes the low
access priority indicator in the request message to the Serving GW/PDN
Gateway. The Serving GW shall forward the indicator to PDN GW in Proxy Binding
Update message.
Other functions related to indicators are described in TS 23.401 [4].

DSMIPv6 option
## 6.2 Initial Attach on S2a
### 6.2.1 Initial Attach Procedure with PMIPv6 on S2a and Anchoring in PDN GW
PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8], is used to setup a PMIPv6 tunnel between
the trusted non-3GPP IP access and the PDN GW. In both roaming and non-roaming
cases, S2a is present. It is assumed that MAG exists in the trusted non-3GPP
IP access.
Figure 6.2.1-1: Initial attachment with Network-based MM mechanism over S2a
for roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured in the gateway.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
This procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over a
trusted non-3GPP access with S2a when the UE already has active PDN
connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN
connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.
1) The initial Non-3GPP access specific L2 procedures are performed. These
procedures are Non-3GPP access specific and are outside the scope of 3GPP.
2) The EAP authentication procedure is initiated and performed involving the
UE, Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server. In the roaming case,
there may be several AAA proxies involved. Subscription data is provided to
the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this step. The list of all
the authorized APNs along with additional PDN GW selection information is
returned to the access gateway as part of the reply from the 3GPP AAA Server
to the trusted non-3GPP access as described in clause 4.5.1. The 3GPP AAA
Server also returns to the trusted non-3GPP access the MN NAI to be used to
identify the UE in Proxy Binding Update and Gateway Control Session
Establishment messages (steps 4 and 10). If supported by Non-3GPP access
network, the Attach Type is indicated to the Non-3GPP access network by the
UE. The mechanism for supporting attach type is access technology specific and
out of scope for 3GPP standardization. Attach Type indicates \"Handover\" when
the UE already has active PDN connection(s) due to mobility from 3GPP access
to non-3GPP access.
NOTE 1: The MN NAI returned from the 3GPP AAA Server to the trusted non-3GPP
access is a permanent IMSI based MN NAI.
3) After successful authentication and authorization, the non-3GPP access
specific L3 attach procedure is triggered. The UE may send requested APN to
the Non-3GPP IP access in this step.
If the UE sends a requested APN in this step, the Trusted non-3GPP Access
verifies that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE does not send a
requested APN the Trusted non-3GPP Access uses the default APN.
The PDN Gateway selection takes place at this point as described in clause
4.5.1. This may entail an additional interaction with the Domain Name Server
function in order to obtain the PDN GW address. If the PDN subscription
profile returned by the 3GPP AAA Server in step 2 contains a PDN GW identity
for the selected APN and the Attach Type does not indicate \"Handover\", the
Non-3GPP access GW may request a new PDN GW as described in clause 4.5.1, e.g.
to allocate a PDN GW that allows for more efficient routeing.
The UE may request the type of address (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix or both)
during this step.
If supported by the non-3GPP access, the UE may send Protocol Configuration
Options in this step using access specific mechanisms. The Protocol
Configuration Options provided by the UE may include the user credentials for
PDN access authorization. In that case, in order to handle situations where
the UE may have subscriptions to multiple PDNs, the UE should also send a
requested APN to the non-3GPP IP access.
4) The Trusted non-3GPP access initiates the Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The
Trusted non-3GPP access provides the information to the PCRF to correctly
associate it with the IP‑CAN session to be established in step 6 and also to
convey subscription related parameters to the PCRF, including the APN-AMBR (if
forwarded by the trusted non-3GPP IP access) and Default Bearer QoS.
5) The MAG function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Proxy Binding Update
(MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key
for downlink traffic, Charging Characteristics, _Additional Parameters_)
message to PDN GW. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The Lifetime field must be
set to a nonzero value. Access Technology Type is set to a value matching the
characteristics of the non-3GPP access. The MAG creates and includes a PDN
connection identity if the MAG supports multiple PDN connections to a single
APN. Handover Indicator is set to indicate attachment over a new interface as
the UE has provided Attach Type indicating \"Initial\" attach. The Additional
Parameters include the Protocol Configuration Options provided by the UE in
step 3 and may also include other information. The MAG requests the IP address
types (IPv4 address and/or IPv6 Home Network Prefix) based on requested IP
address types and subscription profile in the same way as the PDN type is
selected during the E‑UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4]. If the PDN
requires an additional authentication and authorization with an external AAA
Server, the PDN GW performs such an additional authentication and
authorization at the reception of the Proxy Binding Update.
NOTE 2: Any time after initiation of Step 4, Step 5 can be initiated by MAG.
6) The PDN GW initiates the IP‑CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the
PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the
PCRF used to identify the session and associate Gateway Control Sessions
established in step 4 correctly. The PCRF creates IP‑CAN session related
information and responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules and event triggers. The
PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and send the APN-AMBR to the PDN GW in the
response message.
7) The selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and
the APN corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection. The message includes
information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This
information is registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
8) The PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and creates a binding cache
entry for the UE. The PDN GW allocates IP address(es) for the UE. The PDN GW
then sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, _UE Address
Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, charging ID, Additional Parameters_) message
to the MAG function in Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access, including the IP
address(es) allocated for the UE. The UE Address Info includes one or more IP
addresses. The Lifetime indicates the duration of the binding. If the
corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the PDN connection identity, the
PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are
supported. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging
correlation purposes. The Additional Parameters may include Protocol
Configuration Options and other information.
NOTE 3: If UE requests for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, both are allocated.
If the PDN GW operator dictates the use of IPv4 addressing only or IPv6
addressing only for this APN, the PDN GW shall allocate only IPv4 address or
only IPv6 prefix to the UE. If the UE requests for only IPv4 or IPv6 address
only one address is allocated accordingly.
NOTE 4: The MAG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN
connections to the same APN or not.
9) The PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the
PDN GW.
10) The PCRF may update the QoS rules in the trusted non-3GPP access by
initiating the GW Control Session Modification Procedure, as specified in TS
23.203 [19].
11) L3 attach procedure is completed via non-3GPP access specific trigger. IP
connectivity between the UE and the PDN GW is set for uplink and downlink
directions. At this step the IP address information is provided to the UE.
Unless already known from step 3, the Non-3GPP IP access should indicate the
connected PDN identity (APN) to the UE. If supported by the non-3GPP access,
the Protocol Configuration Options provided by the PDN GW in step 8 are
returned to the UE in this step using access specific mechanisms.
### 6.2.2 Void
### 6.2.3 Initial Attach procedure with MIPv4 FACoA on S2a and Anchoring in
PDN-GW
MIPv4 [12] is used to setup a MIP tunnel between the Trusted non-3GPP IP
Access and the PDN GW. It is assumed that a Foreign Agent (FA) is located in
the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access.
Figure 6.2.3-1: Initial attachment when MIPv4 FACoA mode MM mechanism is used
over S2a
When the Attach procedure occurs in the Non-Roaming case (Figure 4.2.2-1), the
vPCRF is not involved. The optional interaction steps between the gateways and
the PCRF in the procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
This procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over a
trusted non-3GPP access with MIPv4 FACoA on S2a when the UE already has active
PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous
PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.
The event that triggers Authentication and Authorization in step 2 between the
Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server, depends on the specific
access technology.
1) The initial Non-3GPP access specific L2 procedure and Non-3GPP access
specific authentication procedures may be performed. These procedures are
outside the scope of 3GPP.
2) The EAP-based authentication procedure for trusted non-3GPP access networks
between UE and the 3GPP EPC shall be performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45].
The PDN Gateway information is returned as part of the reply from the 3GPP AAA
Server to the FA in the trusted non-3GPP access as described in clause 4.5.1.
The Attach Type is indicated to the Non-3GPP access network by the UE as
described in the step 2 of clause 6.2.1.
3) The UE may send an Agent Solicitation (AS) RFC 5944 [12] message.
Specification of this message is out of the scope of 3GPP.
4) The FA in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Foreign Agent
Advertisement (FAA) [12] message to the UE. The FAA message includes the Care-
of Address (CoA) of the Foreign Agent function in the FA. Specification of
this message is out of the scope of 3GPP.
5) The UE sends a Registration Request (RRQ) (MN-NAI, lifetime, APN) message
to the FA as specified in RFC 5944 [12]. The MN NAI identifies the UE. Reverse
Tunnelling shall be requested. This ensures that all traffic will go through
the PDN GW. The RRQ message shall include the NAI-Extension RFC 2794 [34]. The
UE may not indicate a specific Home Agent address in the RRQ message, in which
case the PDN Gateway/Home Agent is selected by the FA as per step 2. The UE
then receives the IP address of the PDN Gateway in step 13 as part of the
Registration Reply (RRP) message. The UE should then include the PDN Gateway
address in the Home Agent address field of subsequent RRQ messages.
Subscription data is provided to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA
in this step. The UE may request connectivity to a specific PDN by using an
APN as specified in RFC 5446 [39]. If the UE provides an APN the FA verifies
that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE does not provide an APN the FA
establishes connectivity with the default PDN. The PDN Gateway selection takes
place at this point as described in clause 4.5.1. This may entail an
additional name resolution step.
6) The Trusted non-3GPP access initiates the Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The
Trusted non-3GPP access provides the information to the PCRF to correctly
associate it with the IP‑CAN session to be established in Step 9 and also to
convey subscription related parameters to the PCRF, including the APN-AMBR (if
forwarded by the trusted non-3GPP IP access) and Default Bearer QoS.
7) The FA processes the message according to RFC 5944 [12] and forwards a
corresponding RRQ (MN-NAI, APN) message to the PDN GW.
8) The selected PDN GW obtains Authentication and Authorization information
from the 3GPP AAA/HSS.
9) The PDN GW allocates an IP address for the UE. The PDN GW initiates the
IP‑CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS
23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the PCRF used to identify the
session and associate Gateway Control Sessions established in step 6
correctly. The PCRF creates IP‑CAN session related information and responds to
the PDN GW with PCC rules and event triggers.
10) The selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity and
the APN corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection. The message includes
information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This
information is registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
11) The PDN GW sends a RRP (MN-NAI, Home Address, Home Agent Address,
Lifetime) as defined in RFC 5944 [12] to the FA. The Home Address includes UE
Home IP address, the Home Agent Address contains the IP address of Home Agent.
The Lifetime indicates the duration of the binding.
12) In case the QoS rules have changed, the PCRF updates the QoS rules in the
Trusted non-3GPP access by initiating the GW Control Session Modification
Procedure, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
13) The FA processes the RRP (MN-NAI, Home Address, Home Agent Address)
according to RFC 5944 [12] and sends a corresponding RRP message to the UE.
14) IP connectivity from the UE to the PDN GW is now setup. A MIPv4 tunnel is
established between the FA in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW.
### 6.2.4 Initial Attach Procedure with PMIPv6 on S2a and Chained S2a and
PMIP-based S8
This clause defines the initial attach procedure for the PMIP-based S8/S2a
chaining. This procedure also applies to the initial attach for PMIP-based
S8/S2b chaining.
Figure 6.2.4-1: Initial attachment for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a/b roaming
scenarios
1) The attach initiation on the trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access is
performed as described in steps 1‑4 of clause 6.2.1 (for trusted non-3GPP
access) and step 1 of clause 7.2.1 (for untrusted non-3GPP access). As part of
the authentication procedure, the 3GPP AAA proxy obtains the PDN GW selection
information from the HSS/AAA as described in clause 4.5.1, and performs
Serving GW selection as described in clause 4.5.3. 3GPP AAA proxy provides
both PDN GW selection information and Serving GW identity to the MAG function
of the trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG. Then the MAG function performs the PDN
GW selection. If PCC is deployed, the MAG function of the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
access is notified to interact with the PCRF when it is PMIP-based chained
case.
2) The MAG function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or ePDG sends a Proxy
Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator,
APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, PDN GW address, Additional Parameters)
message to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The
Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value, indicating registration. Access
Technology Type is set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP
access. The MAG creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the MAG
supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. Handover Indicator is set
to indicate attachment over a new interface. The MAG requests the IP address
types (IPv4 address and/or IPv6 Home Network Prefix) based on requested IP
address types and subscription profile in the same way as the PDN type is
selected during the E‑UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4]. The Additional
Parameters may include Protocol Configuration Options and other information.
3) The Serving GW sends a corresponding Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI,
Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for
downlink traffic, Additional Parameters) message (as in step 2) to the PDN GW.
The GRE key for downlink traffic is allocated by the Serving GW. If the MAG
included the PDN connection identity in the Proxy Binding Update of the
previous step and the Serving GW supports multiple PDN connections to a single
APN then the Serving GW forwards the PDN connection identity to the PDN GW.
NOTE 1: In this Release of the specification, the Serving GW uses the right
protocol to connect with the PDN GW based on the pre-configured information on
itself in case the selected Serving GW supporting both PMIP and GTP.
4) The PDN GW initiates the PCEF-initiated IP CAN Session Establishment
Procedure with the hPCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
5) The selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity. The
message includes information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is
located. The 3GPP AAA Server then conveys this information to the HSS for the
UE.
6) The PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and allocates IP address(es)
for the UE. The PDN GW creates a binding cache entry for the PMIPv6 tunnel
towards the Serving GW and sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI,
Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional
Parameters) message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI
sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration the
binding will remain valid. The UE Address Info includes one or more IP
addresses. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the PDN
connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections
to the given APN are supported. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN
connection for charging correlation purposes. The Additional Parameters may
include Protocol Configuration Options and other information.
NOTE 2: If UE requests for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, both are allocated.
If the UE requests for only IPv4 or IPv6 address only one address is allocated
accordingly.
NOTE 3: The MAG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN
connection to the same APN or not.
7) The Serving GW processes the proxy binding acknowledgement and creates a
binding cache entry for the PMIPv6 tunnel towards the MAG function in the
trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG. At this point, the Serving GW also
establishes the internal forwarding state for the concatenation of the PMIPv6
tunnels. The Serving GW then sends a corresponding Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink
traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message (as in step 7) to the MAG
function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or ePDG. The GRE key for uplink traffic
is allocated by the Serving GW. The Charging ID is assigned for the PDN
connection for charging correlation purposes.
8) The attach procedure is completed as described in steps 10‑11 of clause
6.2.1 (for trusted non-3GPP access) and steps 6‑8 of clause 7.2.1 (for
untrusted non-3GPP access).
## 6.3 Initial Attach Procedure with DSMIPv6 on S2c in Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access
This clause is related to the case when the UE attaches to a Trusted Non-3GPP
Access network and host based mobility management mechanisms are used. Dual
Stack MIPv6 [10] is used for supporting mobility over S2c interface.
The S2c initial attach can be seen to consist of several modules:
A. The UE sets up local IP connectivity in a Trusted Non-3GPP Access
B. The UE discovers the HA, and establishes a security association with it to
protect DSMIPv6 signalling.
C. The UE performs a Binding Update with the PDN GW
Figure 6.3-1: Initial attachment from Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6
Non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local
Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The AAA proxy
and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local Breakout.
In non-roaming scenarios, the AAA proxy and vPCRF are not involved.
This procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over a
trusted non-3GPP access with DSMIPv6 on S2c when the UE already has active PDN
connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN
connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured in the gateway.
The UE may be authenticated and authorised to access the Trusted Non-3GPP
Access network according to an access network specific procedure. These
procedures are outside the scope of 3GPP, After the authentication, UE is
configured with Local IP Address from the access network domain.
A) Setup of Local IP connectivity
1) Access Authentication procedure for trusted Non-3GPP access networks
between UE and the 3GPP EPC shall be performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45]
unless the conditions in TS 33.402 [45] are met that allow to skip this
procedure. As indicated above, in the roaming case signalling may be routed
via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the VPLMN, as specified in TS 23.234 [5]. As part of
the AAA exchange for network access authentication, the AAA/HSS and/or the
3GPP AAA Proxy may return to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access a set of
home/visited operator\'s policies to be enforced on the usage of local IP
address, or IPv6 prefix, allocated by the access system upon successful
authentication. Subscription data is provided to the Trusted non-3GPP IP
Access by the HSS/AAA in this step.
2) The L3 connection is established between the UE and the Trusted Non-3GPP
Access system. As a result of this procedure, an IPv4 address or an IPv6
address/prefix is also assigned to the UE by the access system (i.e. a Local
IP address that will be used as a Care-of Address for DSMIPv6 over the S2c
reference point).
NOTE 1: It is assumed that the access system is aware that network-based
mobility procedures do not need to be initiated.
NOTE 2: The access system may complete the step 2 after step 3.
3) If the access system supports PCC-based policy control, the access gateway
initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as
specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The message includes at least the UE IP address
or IPv6 prefix allocated by the access system in step 2. The message includes
also the IP-CAN type.
Based e.g. on the UE identity and user profile, operator\'s policies and the
IP-CAN type, the PCRF decides on the QoS policy rules and completes the
session establishment towards the access gateway. The rules provided in this
step are referred to the address assigned by the trusted non-3GPP access.
In the roaming case, PCC signalling is sent via a vPCRF in the VPLMN.
NOTE 3: The UE identity information to be used by the access system to
establish the session with the PCRF may be piggybacked by the AAA/HSS in step
1.
B) PDN GW/HA Discovery and HoA Configuration.
4) The UE discovers the PDN GW (Home Agent) as specified in clause 4.5.2 of TS
23.402 (this specification). A security association is established between UE
and PDN GW to secure the DSMIPv6 messages between UE and PDN GW and for
authentication between the UE and the PDN GW. The UE initiates the
establishment of the security association using IKEv2 [9]; EAP [11] is used
over IKEv2 for authentication purposes. The PDN GW communicates with the AAA
infrastructure in order to complete the EAP authentication via S6b. The APN-
AMBR and Default Bearer QoS is provided to the PDN GW in this step.
If the PDN requires an additional authentication and authorization with an
external AAA Server, an additional authentication is executed in this step.
Details on these multiple authentications are specified in RFC 4739 [50] and
in TS 23.234 [5] for I‑WLAN (Private Network Access (PNA)).
During this step the UE may include the APN of the PDN it wants to access and
it can also request the IPv6 home prefix as defined in RFC 5026 [40] in order
to influence the IPv6 home network prefix assignment procedure. Even if the UE
requests more than one IPv6 home prefix, the PDN GW shall assign only one IPv6
home prefix to the UE.
During this step an IPv6 home prefix is assigned by the PDN GW to the UE as
defined in RFC 5026 [40]. After the IPv6 home network prefix is assigned, UE
constructs a home address from it via auto-configuration. The associated PDN
identity (APN) shall be indicated to the UE via the IDr payload. In case the
UE provided APN to the PDN GW earlier in this step, the PDN GW shall not
change the provided APN.
During this step, the PDN GW also informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the identity
of the selected PDN GW and the APN corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection.
The PDN GW also provides information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN
GW is located. This information is registered in the HSS as described in
clause 12.
NOTE 4: The MN NAI and APN string are delivered from the UE to the PDN GW in
step 4 in order to support PCC interactions in step 6.
C) Binding Update
5) The UE sends the DSMIPv6 Binding Update (IP Addresses (HoA, CoA), Lifetime)
message to the PDN GW as specified in RFC 5555 [10]. The UE shall inform the
PDN GW that IP address preservation shall be maintained for the whole home
network prefix.
The PDN GW processes the binding update. During the processing the PDN GW
performs authentication and authorization of the message using the IPsec
security association established in Step 4. During this step the UE can
request an IPv4 home address to the PDN GW as defined in RFC 5555 [10].
6) If PCC is supported, the PDN GW initiates the IP‑CAN Session Establishment
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The message includes
at least the HoA and the CoA. The message may also include a permanent UE
identity and an APN string. The PDN GW shall provide information about the
mobility protocol tunnelling header to the PCRF, the APN-AMBR and Default
Bearer QoS obtained in step 4.
The PCRF decides on the PCC rules and Event Triggers and provisions them to
the PDN GW. The PDN GW installs the received PCC rules.
NOTE 5: The permanent UE identity to be used by the PDN GW to establish the
session with the PCRF may be piggybacked by the AAA/HSS in step 4.
7) The PDN GW sends the DSMIPv6 Binding Ack (Lifetime, IP Addresses (HoA,
CoA)) message to the UE. In this step the PDN GW may include the duration of
the binding and the IPv4 home address allocated for the UE as specified in RFC
5555 [10], if previously requested by the UE and allowed by the subscription
profile as it is specified in the E‑UTRAN attach procedure in TS 23.401 [4].
Even in case the UE requests more than one IPv4 home address in step 5, the
PDN GW shall assign only one IPv4 home address for the UE.
8) The PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure
specified in TS 23.203 [19] by sending a message with the information of
mobility protocol tunnelling encapsulation header to the Trusted non 3GPP
access Gateway. In case the QoS rules have changed, the updated QoS rules
shall also be included in this message.
NOTE 6: Rules related to the HoA can be sent to the Trusted Non-3GPP Access
based on the procedure in clause 6.6.2.
## 6.4 Detach and PDN Disconnection for S2a
### 6.4.1 UE/Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access Network Initiated Detach and
UE/Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access requested PDN Disconnection Procedure with
PMIPv6
#### 6.4.1.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case
The procedure in this clause applies to both Detach Procedures, including UE
or Trusted non-3GPP access initiated detach procedure, and UE/Trusted non-3GPP
Access requested PDN disconnection procedure when supported by the Trusted
non-3GPP access.
The UE can initiate the detach procedure, e.g. when the UE is power off. The
Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network can initiate the detach procedure due to
administrative reasons or detecting the UE\'s leaving by, e.g. Link-layer
event specific to the access technology (refer to PMIPv6 specification, RFC
5213 [8], for more information).
Figure 6.4.1.1-1: UE/Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach
procedure or PDN-disconnection with PMIPv6
For detach procedure and in case of connectivity with multiple PDNs, the steps
2 to 6 are repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to.
For UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure, steps 2 to 6 are performed for
the PDN that the UE requested disconnection from.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps of
interaction between the gateways and PCRF do not occur. Instead, the PDN GW
may employ static configured policies.
1) The UE or the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network triggers either detach or
disconnection from a specific PDN by an access technology specific procedure.
In the case of PDN disconnection of a PDN connection out of multiple PDN
connections, the UE shall use the access specific mechanism for
differentiating the PDN connections towards the same APN (see clause 6.8.1.1)
to indicate the PDN connection to be deregistered and allow the Mobile Access
Gateway in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access to select the corresponding PDN
connection identity needed in step 3 (e.g. the UE informs the Trusted Non-3GPP
access of the prefix to be disconnected).
2) The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiates the Gateway Control Session
Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The
Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network no longer applies QoS policy to traffic flows
for this UE.
3) The Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a
Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, APN, lifetime=0) message to the PDN GW with
lifetime value set to zero, indicating de-registration. The MN NAI identifies
the UE to deregister from the PDN GW. When only one PDN connection to the
given APN is allowed the APN is needed in order to determine which PDN to
deregister the UE from, as some PDN GWs may support multiple PDNs. When
multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported the APN and the PDN
connection identity are needed in order to determine which PDN to deregister
the UE from.
4) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE
no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
5) The PDN GW deletes the IP CAN session associated with the UE and executes a
PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
6) The PDN GW deletes existing entries implied in the Proxy Binding Update
message from its Binding Cache and sends a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, APN,
lifetime=0) message to the MAG.
7) Non-3GPP specific resource release procedure is executed. The resources of
Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network are released. In case of disconnection from a
PDN, if the PDN from which the UE is disconnected was the only PDN that the UE
was connected to, detach related procedures may be performed in the Trusted
non-3GPP IP access.
#### 6.4.1.2 Chained PMIP-based S8-S2a Roaming Case
This clause defines the UE/Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access Network-initiated detach
procedure UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure for PMIP-based S8-S2a
chaining. This procedure also applies to UE/ePDG-initiated detach procedure
for PMIP-based S8-S2b chaining.
Figure 6.4.1.2-1: UE/ePDG/Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach
procedure for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a/b roaming scenarios and PDN-
disconnection for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a
For detach procedure and in case of connectivity with multiple PDNs, the steps
2 to 7 are repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to.
For UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a,
steps 2 to 7 are performed for the PDN that the UE requested disconnection
from.
1) For detach, initial steps of the detach is performed as described in steps
1‑2 of clause 6.4.1.1 (for trusted non-3GPP access) and step 1 of clause
7.4.1.1 (for untrusted non-3GPP access). For UE-requested PDN disconnection in
chained PMIP-based S8-S2a, steps 1-2 of clause 6.4.1.1 are performed.
2) The MAG in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or ePDG sends a Proxy Binding
Update (MN NAI, APN, lifetime=0) message to the Serving GW with lifetime value
set to zero, indicating de-registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE to
deregister from the PDN GW. When only one PDN connection to the given APN is
allowed the APN is needed in order to determine which PDN to deregister the UE
from, as some PDN GWs may support multiple PDNs. When multiple PDN connections
to the given APN are supported the APN and PDN connection identity are needed
in order to determine which PDN to deregister the UE from.
3) The Serving GW deletes all existing entries implied in the Proxy Binding
Update message from its Binding Cache and releases all associated resources
(e.g. GRE tunnel), and then sends a corresponding Proxy Binding Update message
(as in step 2) to the PDN GW in the HPLMN.
4) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE
no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
5) The PDN GW initiates the PCEF-initiated IP CAN Session Termination
Procedure, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
6) The PDN GW deletes existing entries implied in the Proxy Binding Update
message from its Binding Cache and releases all associated resources, and then
sends a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, APN, lifetime=0) message to the Serving GW
in the VPLMN.
7) The Serving GW sends a corresponding Proxy Binding Ack message (as in step
6) to the MAG function in Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access.
8) The detach procedure is completed as described in step 7 of clause 6.4.1.1
(for trusted non-3GPP access) and step 6 of clause 7.4.1.1 (for untrusted
non-3GPP access). In case of disconnection from a PDN, if the PDN from which
the UE is disconnected was the only PDN that the UE was connected to, detach
related procedures may be performed.
### 6.4.2 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach Procedure with PMIPv6
#### 6.4.2.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case
HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with PMIPv6 is illustrated in figure
6.4.2.1-1. The HSS can initiate the procedure e.g. when the user\'s
subscription is removed. The 3GPP AAA Server can initiate the procedure, e.g.
instruction from O&M, timer for re-authentication/re-authorization expired.
If the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure has been initiated to delete the UE
from the Evolved Packet Core, the HSS/AAA server shall initiate the detach
procedure for each of the access systems to which the UE is registered.
Figure 6.4.2.1-1: HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with PMIPv6
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
1) The HSS/AAA sends a Detach Indication message to the MAG in the Trusted
Non-3GPP Access Network to detach a specific UE.
2) This includes the procedure after step 1 as in figure 6.4.1.1-1.
3) The MAG of the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network sends a Detach Ack message
to the 3GPP AAA Server. If the detach procedure was initiated from the 3GPP
AAA Server and if the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Server communicates the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2. If the
detach procedure was initiated by HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server replies to the HSS
as described in clause 12.1.3.
NOTE: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW. The
PDN GW does not remove the PMIP tunnels on S2a, since the MAG in the non-3GPP
access is responsible for removing the PMIP tunnels on S2a. The PDN GW
acknowledges the receipt of the detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA
Server.
#### 6.4.2.2 Chained PMIP-based S8-S2a Roaming Case
This clause defines the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure for PMIP-based
S8-S2a chaining. This procedure also applies for PMIP-based S8-S2b chaining.
If the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure has been initiated to delete the UE
from the Evolved Packet Core, the HSS/AAA server shall initiate the detach
procedure for each of the access systems to which the UE is registered.
Figure 6.4.2.2-1: HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure for chained PMIP-based
S8-S2a/b roaming scenarios
1) The HSS/AAA sends a Detach Indication message to the MAG in the Trusted
Non-3GPP Access Network or ePDG to detach a specific UE.
2) The detach procedure as described in steps 2‑8 of clause 6.4.1.2 is
performed.
3) The MAG of the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network or ePDG sends a Detach Ack
message to the 3GPP AAA Server. If the detach procedure was initiated from the
3GPP AAA Server and if the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA
Server, the 3GPP AAA Server communicates the HSS as described in clause
12.1.2. If the detach procedure was initiated by HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server
replies to the HSS as described in clause 12.1.3.
NOTE: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW. The
PDN GW does not remove the PMIP tunnels on S2a, since the MAG in the non-3GPP
access is responsible for removing the PMIP tunnels on S2a. The PDN GW
acknowledges the receipt of the detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA
Server.
### 6.4.3 UE-initiated Detach Procedure and UE-Requested PDN Disconnection
Procedure with MIPv4 FACoA
The procedure in this clause applies to both UE initiated Detach Procedure and
UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure with MIPv4 FACoA when supported by
the Trusted non-3GPP access.
The UE can initiate this procedure, e.g. when the UE is powered off.
Figure 6.4.3-1: UE-initiated detach procedure with MIPv4 FACoA
NOTE: AAA proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming
(Figure 4.2.3-1) and local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4).
For detach procedure and in case of connectivity with multiple PDNs, the steps
1 to 9 are repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to.
For UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure, steps 1 to 9 are performed for
the PDN that the UE requested disconnection from.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
1) The UE sends a MIPv4 Registration Request (RRQ) (MN-NAI, Home Address, Home
Agent Address, Care-of Address, lifetime = 0) message to the Foreign Agent
(FA) in the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network with lifetime value set to zero,
indicating de-registration. The MN-NAI identifies the UE. The Home Address
includes UE Home IP addresses, the Home Agent Address contains the IP address
of Home Agent. Care-of Address indicates the CoA used by the UE for the
binding.
2) The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiates the Gateway Control Session
Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The
Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network no longer applies QoS policy to traffic flows
for this UE.
3) The FA relays this MIPv4 RRQ (MN-NAI, lifetime = 0) message to the PDN GW.
4) The selected PDN GW obtains Authentication and Authorization information
from the AAA/HSS.
5) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE
no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
6) The PDN GW deletes the IP CAN session associated with the UE and executes a
PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
7) The PDN GW sends a MIPv4 Registration Reply (RRP) (MN-NAI, Home Address,
Home Agent Address, Lifetime=0) message to the FA.
8) Any time after step 7, the FA relays this MIPv4 RRP (MN-NAI, Home Address,
Home Agent Address, Lifetime=0) message to the UE.
9) After step 7, Non-3GPP specific resource release procedure is executed.
### 6.4.4 Network Initiated Detach Procedure with MIPv4 FACoA
Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach procedure with MIPv4 FACoA
Mode is illustrated in Figure 6.4.4‑1. The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network can
initiate this procedure due to administration reason or detecting the UE\'s
leaving by, e.g. Link-layer event specific to the access technology (see RFC
3543 [25] for more information).
Figure 6.4.4-1: Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiated detach procedure
with MIPv4 FACoA
NOTE: AAA proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming
(Figure 4.2.3-1) and local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4).
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
1) The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network detects the UE\'s leaving and initiates
a Gateway Control Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in
TS 23.203 [19]. The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network no longer applies QoS
policy to traffic flows for this UE.
2) The FA sends a Registration Revocation (Home Address, Home Agent Address,
Care-of Address) message (see RFC 3543 [25]) to the PDN GW.
3) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE
no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
4) The PDN GW deletes the IP CAN session associated with the UE and executes a
PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
5) The PDN GW sends a Registration Revocation Ack (Home Address) message (see
RFC 3543 [25]) to the FA.
6) The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network executes a specific resource release
procedure.
### 6.4.5 HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with MIPv4 FACoA
HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with MIPv4 FACoA Mode is illustrated in
Figure 6.4.5-1. The HSS can initiate the procedure e.g. when the user\'s
subscription is removed. The 3GPP AAA Server can initiate the procedure, e.g.
instruction from O&M, timer for re-authentication/re-authorization expired.
If the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure has been initiated to delete the UE
from the Evolved Packet Core, the HSS/AAA server shall initiate the detach
procedure for each of the access systems to which the UE is registered.

Figure 6.4.5-1: HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with MIPv4 FACoA
NOTE 1: AAA proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming
(Figure 4.2.3-1) and local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4).
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
1) The HSS/AAA sends a detach indication message to the FA in the Trusted
Non-3GPP Access Network to detach a specific UE.
2) This includes the procedure in figure 6.4.4-1.
3) The FA sends a Detach Ack message to the 3GPP AAA Server. If the detach
procedure was initiated from the 3GPP AAA Server and if the UE no longer has
any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server communicates the HSS
as described in clause 12.1.2. If the detach procedure was initiated by HSS,
the 3GPP AAA Server replies to the HSS as described in clause 12.1.3.
NOTE 2: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW.
The PGW does not remove the MIPv4 tunnels, since the MIPv4 FA in the non-3GPP
access is responsible for removing the MIPv4 tunnels. The PDN GW acknowledges
the receipt of the detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
## 6.5 Detach and PDN Disconnection for S2c in Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access
### 6.5.1 General
This clause is related to the cases where at least one DSMIPv6 PDN
disconnection procedure is performed. In case of detach the DSMIPv6 PDN
disconnection is executed for all the existing PDNs connections, while in the
case of disconnecting a single PDN connection the DSMIPv6 PDN disconnection is
executed only for the individual PDN connection.
The DSMIPv6 PDN disconnection procedure is on a per PDN basis and allows:
\- the UE to inform the network that it requests to release a S2c based PDN
connection, and
\- the network to inform the UE that a S2c based PDN connection is
disconnected.
The UE may be disconnected from a PDN either explicitly or implicitly:
\- Explicit PDN disconnection: The network or the UE explicitly requests PDN
disconnection and signal with each other.
\- Implicit PDN disconnection: The network disconnects the UE from a PDN,
without notifying the UE. This is typically the case when the network presumes
that it is not able to communicate with the UE, e.g. due to radio conditions.
Three PDN disconnection procedures are provided when the UE accesses the EPS
through S2c:
\- UE-Initiated PDN disconnection Procedure;
\- AAA/HSS-initiated Detach Procedure;
\- PDN GW-initiated PDN disconnection Procedure.
### 6.5.2 UE-initiated PDN disconnection Procedure
The PDN disconnection procedure when initiated by the UE is illustrated in
Figure 6.5.2-1. In case of detaching the UE from EPS, the procedure defined in
this clause must be repeated for each PDN.
Figure 6.5.2-1: UE-initiated DSMIPv6 PDN disconnection procedure in Trusted
Non-3GPP Access Network
Non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-2), home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-3) and Local
Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The AAA proxy
and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local Breakout.
In non-roaming scenarios, the AAA proxy and vPCRF are not involved.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
1\. If the UE wants to terminate a S2c session for a given PDN, it shall send
a de-registration Binding Update (HoA, Lifetime=0) as specified in RFC 5555
[10].
2\. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the
PDN GW is in the VPLMN, signalling may be routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the
VPLMN. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP
AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
3\. If there is an active PCC session for the UE, the PDN GW shall execute a
PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
4\. The PDN GW shall send a Binding Acknowledgement as specified in RFC 5555
[10]
5\. The PCRF shall remove all active QoS rules which refer to the Home
Address. The PCRF executes a PCRF-Initiated Gateway Control Session
Termination Procedure with the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access as specified in TS
23.203 [19]. The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access will no longer perform any QoS
policy or gateway control function associated with the terminated session.
This step describes the case where there are no QoS rules remaining for that
UE at the trusted non-3GPP access and thus the GW control session termination
is executed. In case there are still active QoS rules for the UE, the GW
control session termination procedure is replaced by a QoS rule provision
procedure.
6\. The UE terminates the IKEv2 security association for the given PDN as
defined in RFC 5996 [9]
7\. After IKEv2 SA termination, non-3GPP specific resource release procedure
may be executed.
### 6.5.3 HSS / AAA-initiated Detach Procedure
The Detach procedure when initiated by the HSS/AAA is illustrated in Figure
6.5.3-1. The Detach procedure defined in this clause must be repeated for each
PDN.
If the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure has been initiated to delete the UE
from the Evolved Packet Core, the HSS/AAA server shall initiate the detach
procedure for each of the access systems to which the UE is registered.
In the explicit detach procedure steps 2, 3 and 7 of Figure-6.5.3-1, are
performed as illustrated. In the implicit detach, steps 2, 3 and 7 of Figure
6.5.3-1, are omitted.
Figure 6.5.3-1: AAA/HSS-initiated S2c detach procedure in Trusted Non-3GPP
Access Network
Non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-2) and Local
Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The 3GPP AAA
proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local
Breakout. In non-roaming scenarios, the 3GPP AAA proxy and vPCRF are not
involved.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps 4 and 6 do
not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
1\. If the HSS/AAA wants to request the immediate termination of a S2c session
for a given UE and a given PDN, it shall send a Session Termination message to
the PDN GW. In the roaming case signalling may be routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy
in the VPLMN.
2\. The PDN GW shall send a detach request message.
3\. The UE shall acknowledge the detach request.
NOTE 1: How the detach request and acknowledge messages are implemented is a
stage 3 detail.
4\. If there is an active PCC session for the UE, the PDN GW shall execute a
PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
5\. The PDN GW shall acknowledge the termination of the S2c session to the
AAA. If the detach procedure was initiated from the 3GPP AAA Server and if the
UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server
communicates the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2. If the detach procedure
was initiated by HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server replies to the HSS as described in
clause 12.1.3.
6\. The PCRF shall remove any active QoS Policy rule which is referred to the
Home Address. The PCRF executes a PCRF-Initiated Gateway Control Session
Termination Procedure with the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access as specified in TS
23.203 [19]. The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access will no longer perform any QoS
policy or gateway control function associated with the terminated session.
This step describes the case where there are no QoS rules remaining for that
UE at the trusted non-3GPP access and thus the GW control session termination
is executed. In case there are still active QoS rules for the UE, the GW
control session termination procedure is replaced by a QoS rule provision
procedure.
7\. The PDN GW or the UE terminates the IKEv2 security association for the
given PDN as defined in RFC 5996 [9].
8\. After IKEv2 SA termination, non-3GPP specific resource release procedure
may be executed.
NOTE 2: The HSS/AAA may (e.g. when STa is implemented and/or based on
operator\'s policies) also send a detach indication message to the non-3GPP
access. The HSS/AAA should wait to receive acknowledgement(s) from PGW(s)
before sending the detach indication to the non-3GPP access. The non-3GPP
access detaches the UE and acknowledges the receipt of the detach indication
message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
### 6.5.4 PDN GW-initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure
The PDN Disconnection procedure when initiated by the PDN GW is illustrated in
Figure 6.5.4-1.
Figure 6.5.4-1: PDN GW- initiated PDN Disconnection S2c procedure in Trusted
Non-3GPP Access Network
Non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-2) and Local
Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The 3GPP AAA
proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local
Breakout. In non-roaming scenarios, the 3GPP AAA proxy and vPCRF are not
involved.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 3 does not
occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
If the PDN GW-initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure is triggered by the UE
binding lifetime expiration (Implicit PDN disconnection procedure), steps 1
and 2 may be omitted.
1\. In the explicit detach procedure the PDN GW shall send a detach request
message.
2\. In the explicit detach procedure, the UE shall acknowledge the detach
request.
NOTE: How the detach request and acknowledge messages are implemented is a
stage 3 detail.
3\. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the
PDN GW is in the VPLMN, signalling may be routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the
VPLMN. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP
AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
4\. If there is an active PCC session for the UE, the PDN GW shall execute a
PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
5\. The PCRF shall remove all active QoS rules which refer to the Home
Address. The PCRF executes a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision procedure
or, if this is the last PDN Connection for the UE, a PCRF-Initiated Gateway
Control Session Termination Procedure with the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access as
specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access will no longer
perform any QoS policy or gateway control function associated with the
terminated PDN Connection.
6\. The PDN GW or the UE may terminate the IKEv2 security association for the
given PDN as defined in RFC 5996 [9].
7\. After IKEv2 SA termination, non-3GPP specific resource release procedure
may be executed.
## 6.6 Network-initiated Dynamic PCC
### 6.6.1 Network-initiated Dynamic PCC on S2a
If dynamic PCC is deployed, the procedure given in Figure 6.6.1-1 is used by
the PCRF to provision rules to the Trusted non-3GPP IP access and for the
Trusted non-3GPP IP access to enforce the policy by controlling the resources
and configuration in the trusted non-3GPP access. The access specific
procedure executed in the trusted non-3GPP access is not within the scope of
this specification.
Figure 6.6.1-1: Network-initiated dynamic policy control procedure in Trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access for S2a
This procedure concerns both the non-roaming (as Figure 4.2.2-1) and roaming
case (as Figure 4.2.3-1). In the roaming case, the vPCRF in the VPLMN forwards
messages between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the hPCRF in the HPLMN. In
the case of Local Breakout (as Figure 4.2.3-4), the vPCRF forwards messages
sent between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is
not involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
1\. The PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Provision
Procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19] by sending a message with the QoS rules
and Event Trigger information to the Trusted non-3GPP access network..
2\. The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access enforces the rules provisioned to it, and
establish all necessary resources and configuration in the non-3GPP access
system, ,for e.g.. initiate a dedicated bearer activation, modification or
deactivation, if supported. The details of this step are out of the scope of
this specification.
3\. The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access responds to the PCRF indicating its ability
to enforce the rules provisioned to it in Step 1 and thus completing the GW
Control and QoS Rules Provision procedure started in step A.1.
4\. The PCRF initiates the PCC Rules Provision Procedure as specified in TS
23.203 [19]. The PCRF provides updated PCC rules to the PCEF for enforcement
by means of an PCC Rules Provision procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19].
NOTE: Step 4 may occur before step 1 or performed in parallel with steps 1‑3
if acknowledgement of resource allocation is not required to update PCC rules
in PCEF. For details please refer to TS 23.203 [19].
### 6.6.2 Network-initiated Dynamic PCC for S2c over Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access
This clause is related to the case when network-initiated dynamic resource
allocation is supported, and it is utilized for the S2c traffic flow
aggregates.
The procedure described in this clause may also be used subsequent to the S2c
Attach procedure described in clause 6.3.
In this case, the PCRF may push specific PCC rules to the PDN GW and QoS
Policy rules to the Trusted Non-3GPP Access system, in case the Access System
supports PCC.
Figure 6.6.2-1: Network-initiated dynamic policy control for S2c over Trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access
This procedure concerns both the non-roaming (as Figure 4.2.2-2) and roaming
case (as Figure 4.2.3-3). In the roaming case, the vPCRF in the VPLMN forwards
messages between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the hPCRF in the HPLMN. In
the case of Local Breakout (as Figure 4.2.3-4), the vPCRF forwards messages
sent between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is
not involved at all.
Steps 1‑4 are the same as in steps 1‑4 in clause 6.6.1. Step 4 may be skipped
in case the PCC rules at the PDN GW are already up-to-date.
## 6.7 UE-initiated Resource Request and Release
### 6.7.1 UE-initiated Resource Request and Release on S2a
This procedure is applicable to both PMIPv6 on S2a and DSMIPv6 on S2c.
This clause is related to the case when UE-initiated resource request and
release is supported in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access, and it is utilized for
the S2a/S2c traffic flow aggregates.
Figure 6.7.1-1 depicts the procedure for the roaming and non-roaming cases.
Figure 6.7.1-1: UE-initiated resource request/release with S2a or S2c
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
Both the roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios
are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case, the vPCRF acts as an
intermediary, sending the QoS Policy Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the
HPLMN to the trusted non-3GPP IP access in the VPLMN. The vPCRF receives the
Acknowledgment from the trusted non-3GPP IP access and forwards it to the
hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.
1\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access receives an IP-CAN specific resource
allocation or resource release request initiated by the UE.
2\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access initiates the Gateway Control and QoS
Policy Rules Request Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The trusted
non-3GPP IP access provides the UE request or release of resources as an Event
Report. The PCRF makes a PCC decision as a result of the Gateway Control and
QoS policy request and provides the updated QoS Rules to the trusted non-3GPP
IP access.
3\. An IP-CAN specific resource allocation or resource release procedure may
be triggered by the enforcement of the received policy rules. In this step, a
response for the resource request/release is sent to the UE.
4\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access indicates to the PCRF whether the requested
QoS Policy Rules Provision could be enforced or not and thus completing the GW
Control and QoS Rules Provision procedure.
5\. The PCRF initiates the Policy and Charging Rules Provision Procedure as
specified in TS 23.203 [19] to update the PCC rules in the PDN GW. The updated
PCC Rules and Event Triggers include any adjustments to resources due to the
decision taken in step 2.
NOTE: Step 5 may be performed in parallel with Steps 2‑4 if acknowledgement of
resource allocation is not required at the PCRF to update PCC rules in PCEF.
For details please refer to TS 23.203 [19].
Step 2 may be omitted if the Trusted non-3GPP IP access has already received
authorisation for the UE\'s request from the PCRF, e.g.. QoS rules downloaded
at handover.
### 6.7.2 UE-initiated Resource Request for S2c over Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access
The procedure is specified in clause 6.7.1.
## 6.8 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN
### 6.8.1 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with PMIPv6 on S2a
#### 6.8.1.0 General
This procedure is used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN over
trusted non-3GPP access with PMIPv6 on S2a when the UE already has active PDN
connections over such trusted access. This procedure is also used to request
for connectivity to an additional PDN over trusted non-3GPP access with PMIPv6
on S2a when the UE is simultaneously connected to such trusted access and a
3GPP access, and the UE already has active PDN connections over both the
accesses.
The procedure is also used for the re-establishment of existing PDN
connectivity after the UE performed the handover from 3GPP accesses for the
first PDN connection by the Attach procedure.
#### 6.8.1.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case
Establishment of connectivity to an additional PDN over trusted access with
S2a is supported only for the accesses that support such feature and the UEs
that have such capability.
PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8], is used to setup an IP connectivity
between the trusted non-3GPP IP access and the EPC during initial attach. In
both roaming and non-roaming cases, S2a is present. It is assumed that MAG
exists in the trusted non-3GPP IP access.
There can be more than one PDN connection per APN if both the MAG and the PDN
GW support that feature. When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are
supported, during the establishment of a new PMIP tunnel, the MAG creates and
sends a PDN Connection identity to the PDN GW. The PDN connection identity is
unique in the scope of the UE and the APN and within a Trusted non-3GPP access
network, i.e. the MN-ID, the APN, and the PDN connection identity together
identify a PDN connection within a Trusted non-3GPP access network. In order
to be able to identify a specific established PDN connection, both the MAG and
the PDN GW shall store the PDN Connection identity. Sending the PDN connection
identity is an indication that the MAG supports multiple PDN connections to a
single APN and the PDN GW shall be able to indicate if it supports multiple
PDN connections to a single APN.
NOTE 1: When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are used, the MN-ID and
the APN together is not enough to identify the PDN connection. Therefore
between the UE and MAG an access network specific mechanism is needed to
differentiate the PDN connections to the same APN. Differentiating the PDN
connections within one access is needed in order to operate on the correct PDN
connection, e.g. when the PDN connection is removed. Differentiating the PDN
connections across accesses, e.g. during handover, is not needed. The
specification of such a mechanism is out of scope of 3GPP.
Figure 6.8.1.1-1: Additional PDN connectivity with Network-based MM mechanism
over S2a for non-roaming and roaming
The steps in the procedure which are marked as optional occur only if dynamic
policy provisioning has been deployed.
In the roaming case, messages are forwarded between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access and the hPCRF via the vPCRF. In the case of LBO, messages are forwarded
between the PDN GW and the hPCRF via the vPCRF also. Further, in the case of
LBO, messages between the PDN GW and the 3GPP AAA Server are sent via the 3GPP
AAA Proxy.
1) When the UE wishes to connect to an additional PDN, it sends a trigger
indicating that connectivity with that specific PDN is desired. The UE
provides information about the new PDN by using an APN. When multiple PDN
connections to a single APN are supported then some additional access specific
mechanism is needed between the UE and the MAG to differentiate the PDN
connections towards the same APN. If supported by the non-3GPP access, the UE
may send Protocol Configuration Options in this step using access specific
mechanisms. The Protocol Configuration Options provided by the UE may include
the user credentials for PDN access authorization. The UE triggers the re-
establishment of existing PDN connectivity after the handover by providing a
Request Type indicating \"Handover\" on accesses that support the indication.
NOTE 2: The definition of the trigger that the UE provides to the access
network (MAG) is out of scope of 3GPP.
2) At this step the trusted non-3GPP IP access performs PDN GW selection as
described in clause 4.5.1. Steps 4 to 10 according to clause 6.2.1 are
executed with PDN GW2 instead of PDN GW1.
3) The trusted non-3GPP IP access system sends the reply message to the UE
with the allocated IP address from the PDN that the UE indicated at step 1. If
supported by the non-3GPP access, the Protocol Configuration Options provided
by the PDN GW in step 2 are returned to the UE in this step using access
specific mechanisms. Since UE requested for additional PDN connectivity, the
UE configures the IP address received from the MAG without deleting its
configuration for connectivity with any other previously established PDN. For
handover, the UE is returned the IP address the UE obtained before the
handover during PDN connectivity establishment.
NOTE 3: The definition of the message used to carry the new connectivity
information to the UE is out of scope of 3GPP.
4) The PMIPv6 tunnel is thus set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and
the PDN GW corresponding to the requested additional PDN while maintaining
tunnels previously established for other PDNs.
#### 6.8.1.2 Chained PMIP-based S8-S2a Roaming Case
This clause defines the UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN for PMIP-
based S8-S2a chaining. This procedure also applies for PMIP-based S8-S2b
chaining.
Multiple PDN connections to a single APN can be established if it is supported
by the MAG, the Serving GW and the PDN GW. When multiple PDN connections to a
single APN are supported, during the establishment of a new PDN connection,
the use of PDN connection identity is used as specified in clause 6.8.1.1 and
the Serving GW shall forward the PDN connection identity between the
concatenated PMIP tunnels.
Figure 6.8.1.2-1: Additional PDN connectivity for chained PMIP-based S8-S2a/b
roaming scenarios
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
The gateway control signalling in steps 2 and 4 between the gateway and PCRF
occur only for Trusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses.
1) When the UE wishes to connect to an additional PDN, it sends a trigger
according to step 1 of clause 6.8.1.1 (Figure 6.8.1.1-1).
2) The non-3GPP access gateway initiates the Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the hPCRF by way of the vPCRF, as specified in TS
23.203 [19].
3) Steps 2 to 7 according to clause 6.2.4 (Figure 6.2.4-1) are executed with
PDN GW2 instead of PDN GW1.
4) In case the QoS rules have changed, the hPCRF by way of the vPCRF updates
the QoS rules at the non-3GPP access gateway by initiating the GW Control
Session Modification Procedure, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
5) The trusted non-3GPP access system or ePDG sends the reply message to the
UE according to step 3 of clause 6.8.1.1 (Figure 6.8.1.1-1). If supported by
the trusted non-3GPP access system, the Protocol Configuration Option provided
by the PDN GW in step 3 are returned to the UE in this step using access
specific mechanisms.
### 6.8.2 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with MIPv4 FACoA on S2a
This procedure is used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN over
trusted non-3GPP access with MIPv4 FACoA on S2a when the UE already has active
PDN connections over such trusted access. This procedure is also used to
request for connectivity to an additional PDN over trusted non-3GPP access
with MIPv4 FACoA on S2a when the UE is simultaneously connected to such
trusted access and a 3GPP access, and the UE already has active PDN
connections over both the accesses.
NOTE: The PDN GW treats each MN-ID+APN as a separate binding and may allocate
a new IP address for each binding.
Multiple connections to the same APN is supported for MIPv4 FACoA on S2a as
the UE and PDN GW distinguish between connections by means of the UE\'s
distinct home addresses for each connection.
Figure 6.8.2-1: UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with MIPv4 FACoA
on S2a
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves
as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
1) When the UE wishes to connect to an additional PDN, UE sends a Registration
Request (RRQ) (MN-NAI, lifetime, APN) RFC 5944 [12] message to the FA as
specified in RFC 5944 [12]. Reverse Tunnelling shall be requested. This
ensures that all traffic will go through the PDN GW. The RRQ message shall
include the NAI-Extension RFC 2794 [34]. The UE may not indicate a specific
Home Agent address in the RRQ message, in which case the PDN Gateway/Home
Agent is selected by the FA. The UE then receives the IP address of the PDN
Gateway in step 3 as part of the Registration Reply (RRP) message. The UE
should then include the PDN Gateway address in the Home Agent address field of
subsequent RRQ messages. The UE provides information about the new PDN by
using an APN as specified in RFC 5446 [39].
2) The trusted non-3GPP IP access performs a PDN GW selection for the new PDN
connection. Steps 6‑12 of clause 6.2.3 are executed with PDN GW2 instead of
PDN GW1. The AAA interactions for obtaining Authentication and Authorization
information occur irrespective of whether the UE has a PDN connection with a
different APN to the same PDN GW or not.
3) The FA processes the RRP (MN-NAI, Home Address, Home Agent Address, APN)
message according to RFC 5944 [12] and sends a corresponding RRP message to
the UE.
4) The MIPv4 tunnel is thus set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and
the PDN GW2 corresponding to the requested additional PDN while maintaining
tunnels previously established for other PDNs.
### 6.8.3 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN from Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access with DSMIPv6 on S2c
This clause is related to the case when the UE attaches to a Trusted Non-3GPP
Access network and host-based mobility management mechanisms are used. Dual
Stack MIPv6 [10] is used for supporting mobility over S2c interface. This case
describes the scenario when UE adds connectivity to one or more additional PDN
at any time after initial attach. Since host-based mobility mechanisms are
used, the procedure is similar to the initial attach procedure.
This procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN
over trusted non-3GPP access with DSMIPv6 on S2c when the UE is simultaneously
connected to such trusted access and a 3GPP access, and the UE already has
active PDN connections over both the accesses.
NOTE: Based on the MN-ID and APN, the PDN GW may allocate a new IP
address/prefix for a new binding.
Figure 6.8.3-1: UE-initiated connectivity to multiple PDNs from Trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6
When the initial attachment is performed, the UE performs procedures described
in clause 6.3, Figure 6.3-1, to obtain connectivity with a PDN GW and a
specific PDN. If at any time, the UE wants to obtain connectivity with
additional PDNs, it repeats steps 4-8 of Figure 6.3-1.
1). The UE performs PDN GW discovery for the new PDN and repeats steps 4-8 of
clause 6.3, Figure 6.3-1 for each additional PDN the UE wants to connect to.
This step can be performed and be repeated at any time after the initial
attach for one or multiple PDNs.
If the UE discovers a different PDN GW for the additional PDN connectivity,
when the current PDN GW could provide access to the additional PDN, the PDN GW
reallocation procedure may be used, as defined in clause 6.10.
## 6.9 Void
## 6.10 PDN GW reallocation upon attach on S2c
The PDN GW reallocation procedure depicted in figure 6.10-1 can be used by the
HSS/AAA to force the assignment of a new PDN GW to the UE upon attach with
DSMIPv6 in a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP IP access. The decision on whether
to trigger PDN GW reallocation is taken by the HSS/AAA according to the
principles described in clause 4.5.2.
Figure 6.10-1: PDN GW reallocation upon attach on S2c
The following is a detailed description of the involved steps:
1) The UE authenticates in the trusted non-3GPP access, or establishes the
IPsec tunnel with the ePDG, and obtains a local IP address to be used as care-
of address for DSMIPv6.
2) The UE establishes the DSMIPv6 SA with the initially discovered PDN GW.
This implies an AAA exchange with the HSS/AAA. The HSS/AAA triggers the
reallocation of the PDN GW and the APN associated with the UE\'s PDN
Connection by piggybacking a reallocation indication and the target PDN GW
identity in the AAA exchange. In the signalling from the PDN-GW to the UE, the
PDN-GW indicates reallocation, assigns no IPv6 prefix to the UE and includes
the IP address of the target PDN GW.
If the target PDN GW identity is stored in the HSS in form of the IP address,
then this IP address can be transferred to the UE directly. If the target PDN
GW identity is stored in the HSS in form of the PDN GW FQDN, the initial PDN
GW shall derive the IP address of the HA functionality of the target PDN GW
from the PDN GW FQDN provided by the AAA server and provide it to the UE.
3) The UE establishes the DSMIPv6 SA with the target PDN GW provided by the
network during step 2.
4) The UE performs the DSMIPv6 registration with the target PDN GW.
NOTE 1: In case the UE performs DSMIPv6 bootstrapping for an existing PDN
connection, the UE includes its IPv6 Home Address during step 2.
NOTE 2: The DSMIPv6 SA between the UE and the initial PDN GW may be implicitly
removed by the UE and the initial PDN GW any time after step 2, before expiry
of the SA.
## 6.11 S2c Bootstrapping via DSMIPv6 Home Link over a Trusted Access
When the UE is connected on a trusted non-3GPP access considered to be DSMIPv6
home link for the UE based on clause 4.5.6, the UE may trigger the
establishment of S2c IKEv2 SA, e.g. to optimize future handovers to other
accesses using S2c. For each PDN connection, the S2c IKEv2 SA establishment
has to be performed separately.
NOTE: A trusted non-3GPP access can be defined as DSMIPv6 Home Link in
addition to the 3GPP access.
Once the UE is attached to the PDN over the trusted non-3GPP access, the
procedure describing the bootstrapping is in clause 15.1.
## 6.12 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation
### 6.12.1 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with S2a PMIP
This procedure is performed to release all the resources associated with the
PDN address, for example, due to IP‑CAN session modification requests from the
PCRF or due to handover from Non-3GPP to 3GPP. When it is performed for an
handover, the connections associated with the PDN address are released, but
the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.
Figure 6.12.1-1: PDN GW Initiated Binding Revocation with S2a PMIP
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP IP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 6.12.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation
Deactivation procedure may for example be triggered due to \'IP CAN session
Modification procedure\', as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, the
resources associated with the PDN connection in the PDN GW are released.
The PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation can also be triggered
during handovers from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.
2\. The PDN GW sends a Binding Revocation Indication message to the trusted
non-3GPP IP access.
3\. The resources may be released in the trusted non-3GPP IP access, according
to an access specific, trusted non-3GPP IP access initiated, release
mechanism.
4\. If the resources are released in the trusted non-3GPP IP access, the
trusted non-3GPP IP access initiates a Gateway Control Session Termination
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
5\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access returns a Binding Revocation
Acknowledgement message to the PDN GW.
6\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are
released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN
disconnection. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
NOTE: For some accesses, the resources may be released independently of
deactivation from the PDN GW.
### 6.12.2 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with S2a MIPv4
This procedure is performed to release all resource allocations associated
with the PDN address, for example, due to IP‑CAN session modification requests
from the PCRF or due to handover without optimization from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.
When it is performed for an handover, the connections associated with the PDN
address are released, but the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.
Figure 6.12.2-1: PDN GW Initiated Registration Revocation over S2a MIPv4
interface
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. For the Roaming and Local
Breakout cases, the vPCRF forwards messages between the non-3GPP access and
the hPCRF. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the
PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at
all.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 6.12.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation
Deactivation procedure may for example be triggered due to \'IP CAN session
Modification procedure\' as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case the
resources associated with the PDN connection in the PDN GW are released.
The PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation can also be triggered
during handovers from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.
2\. If the revocation support has been negotiated, the PDN GW sends a
Registration Revocation message to the trusted non-3GPP IP access as defined
in RFC 3543 [25].
3\. The resources may be released in the trusted non-3GPP IP access, according
to an access specific, trusted non-3GPP IP access initiated, release
mechanism.
4\. The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network detects the UE\'s leaving and
initiates a Gateway Control Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as
specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network no longer
applies QoS policy to service data flows for this UE.
5\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access returns a Registration Revocation
Acknowledgement message to the PDN GW.
6\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are
released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN
disconnection. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
NOTE: For some accesses, the resources may be released independently of
deactivation from the PDN GW.
### 6.12.3 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation for Chained PMIP-
based S8-S2a Roaming
This clause defines the PDN GW initiated resource allocation deactivation for
chained PMIP-based S8-S2a roaming. This procedure also applies for PMIP-based
S8-S2b chaining.
Figure 6.12.3-1: PDN GW Initiated Binding Revocation for Chained PMIP-based
S8-S2a Roaming Case
The optional interaction step between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 6.12.3-1 occur only if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policies may be statically configured in the gateway.
1\. The PDN GW sends a Binding Revocation Indication message to the MAG
function in the Serving GW.
2\. The Serving GW sends a corresponding Binding Revocation Indication message
to the MAG function of the trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG.
3\. The trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG may release allocated resources in
the non-3GPP IP access according to access specific release mechanisms.
4\. In case a Gateway Control Session between the trusted non-3GPP access or
ePDG and hPCRF exists, the Gateway Control Session Termination procedure, as
specified in TS 23.203 [19], is performed.
5\. The MAG function of the trusted non-3GPP IP access or ePDG returns a
Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message to the Serving GW.
6\. The MAG function of the Serving GW or ePDG sends a corresponding Binding
Revocation Acknowledgement message to the PDN GW.
7\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are
released in the PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN
disconnection. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
NOTE: For some accesses, the resources may be released independently of
deactivation from the PDN GW.
### 6.12.4 Void
## 6.13 PDN GW initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure
This procedure is initiated by the PDN GW when the UE releases the IPv4
address using DHCPv4 procedure or the lease for the IP address has expired.
The procedure is used to delete the IPv4 address from the PDN connection
bearer context.
Figure 6.13-1: PDN GW initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured in the gateway.
The roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case,
the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, relaying the PCC messages between the hPCRF
in the HPLMN to the BBERF/PCEF in the VPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP
AAA Server in the HPLMN.
1\. The PCEF initiates the IP‑CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF
as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides the information to enable
the PCRF to uniquely identify the IP‑CAN session.
2\. In case QoS rules have to be modified, e.g. change of SDF filters, the
PCRF initiates a GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure as described in
TS 23.203 [19] to inform the Trusted non-3GPP access of the updated QoS rules.
3\. The Trusted non-3GPP Access initiates the \"Network-initiated Dynamic PCC
on S2a\" procedure to release the bearers.
4\. The trusted non-3GPP access informs the PCRF of the success of the QoS
rules enforcement, thus ending the GW Control and QoS rules provision
procedure described in TS 23.203 [19].
5\. The PDN GW sends a Binding Revocation Indication (PDN address) message to
the trusted non-3GPP access to revoke the IPv4 address.
6\. The trusted non-3GPP access returns a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement
message to the PDN GW.
## 6.14 Non-3GPP access initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure
This procedure is initiated by the Trusted non-3GPP access when the UE
releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 procedure or the lease for the IP
address has expired. The procedure is used to delete the IPv4 address from the
PDN connection and bearer context.
Figure 6.14-1: Non-3GPP access initiated IPv4 address Delete Procedure
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured in the gateway.
The roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case,
the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, relaying the PCC messages between the hPCRF
in the HPLMN to the BBERF/PCEF in the VPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP
AAA Server in the HPLMN.
1\. The MAG in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN
NAI, APN, lifetime=0, IPv4 only indication) message to the PDN GW with
lifetime value set to zero, indicating de-registration. The MN NAI identifies
the UE to deregister from the PDN GW. The indication for IPv4 only informs the
UE that only the IPv4 address from BCE is to be deleted. The APN is needed in
order to determine which PDN GW to de-register the UE from, as some PDNs may
support multiple PDNs.
2\. The PDN GW modifies the existing entry to delete the IPv4 address implied
in the Proxy Binding Update message from its Binding Cache and releases all
associated resources, and then sends a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, APN,
lifetime=0, IPv4 only indicator) message to the MAG in trusted non-3GPP
access.
3\. The PDN-GW initiates the PCEF initiated IP-CAN session modification
procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19] to inform the PCRF of the deleted
IPv4 address. If PCC rules have changed the PCRF provides the updated PCC
rules to the PDN-GW as part of this procedure.
4\. In case QoS rules have to be modified, e.g. change of SDF filters, the
PCRF initiates a GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure as described in
TS 23.203 [19] to inform the S‑GW of the updated QoS rules.
5\. An IP‑CAN specific or resource release procedure may be triggered by the
enforcement of the received policy rules.
6\. The Trusted non-3GPP access informs the PCRF of the success of the QoS
rules enforcement, thus ending the GW Control and QoS rules provision
procedure described in TS 23.203 [19].
## 6.15 IPv4 Home Address Release Procedure for S2c
This procedure is initiated by the UE to release an IPv4 Home Address
previously registered at the PDN GW.
Figure 6.15-1: IPv4 Home Address Release Procedure for S2c
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured in the gateway.
The roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case,
the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, relaying the PCC messages between the hPCRF
in the HPLMN to the BBERF/PCEF in the VPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all. In the Roaming and LBO cases, the 3GPP AAA Proxy
serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP
AAA Server in the HPLMN.
1\. If the UE has previously registered IPv4 home address and wants to release
it, the UE sends a Binding Update (IPv6 HoA, lifetime) message to the PDN GW
without including the IPv4 HoA, indicating de-registration for the IPv4 Home
Address only.
2\. The PDN GW modifies the existing entry to delete the IPv4 home address
implied in the Binding Update message from its Binding Cache and releases all
associated resources, and then sends a Binding Ack message to the UE.
3\. The PDN-GW initiates the PCEF initiated IP-CAN session modification
procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19] to inform the PCRF of the deleted
IPv4 address. If PCC rules have changed the PCRF provides the updated PCC
rules to the PDN-GW as part of this procedure.
4\. In case QoS rules have to be modified, e.g. change of SDF filters, the
PCRF initiates a GW Control and QoS rules provision procedure as described in
TS 23.203 [19] to inform the S‑GW of the updated QoS rules.
5\. An IP CAN specific or resource release procedure may be triggered by the
enforcement of the received policy rules.
6\. The Trusted non-3GPP access informs the PCRF of the success of the QoS
rules enforcement, thus ending the GW Control and QoS rules provision
procedure described in TS 23.203 [19].
## 6.16 Enhanced security support for S2c
### 6.16.1 General
Optionally UE and PDN GW may support integrity protection and/or
confidentiality protection of user plane traffic exchanged over the S2c tunnel
when the UE is in a trusted non-3GPP access.
### 6.16.2 Activation of enhanced security for S2c
Figure 6.16.1-1: Enhanced security support activation
1) The UE performs an initial attach procedure to a trusted non-3GPP access
with S2c as described in clause 6.3 or performs a handover procedure to a
trusted non-3GPP access as specified in clause 8.4.2. At the end of this step
the UE is connected to a trusted non-3GPP access via S2c.
2) At any time when the UE is connected to a trusted non-3GPP access the UE or
the PDN GW may trigger the creation of a child IPsec Security Association for
protecting the traffic sent via the S2c reference point. The child SA is
created as specified in RFC 4877 [22]. The child SA may provide user plane
integrity protection. Additionally, the same child SA may be used also for
user plane confidentiality protection.
3) The PDN GW initiates an IP-CAN session modification procedure to provide to
the PCRF new tunnel information.
4) Based on the tunnel information provided by the PDN GW, the PCRF initiates
a QoS rules provision procedure to the trusted non-3GPP access indicating the
new tunnel information.
NOTE 1: If confidentiality protection is activated, the usage of PCC for per
UE and/or per IP flow QoS differentiation in the trusted non-3GPP access is
not possible in this Release of the specification.
NOTE 2: If confidentiality protection is activated, in roaming scenarios the
traffic collected by the VPLMN for legal interception purposes is encrypted.
NOTE 3: If the establishment of the child IPsec Security Association fails,
based on operator\'s policies and user\'s settings the UE or the PDN GW may
terminate the S2c session using the PDN disconnection procedures specified in
clause 6.5.
### 6.16.3 De-activation of enhanced security for S2c
Figure 6.16.2-1: Enhanced security support de-activation
1) The UE and the PDN GW have established enhanced security based on clause
6.16.1. As a result user plane traffic exchanged through S2c is integrity
protected and/or confidentiality protected.
2) At any time the UE or the PDN GW may trigger the removal of a child IPsec
Security Association for protecting the traffic sent via the S2c reference
point. The child SA is removed as specified in RFC 4877 [22].
NOTE: Integrity protection and/or confidentiality protection can be de-
activated also after the handover to another access and not only from the
trusted non-3GPP access it was activated.
3) The PDN GW initiates an IP-CAN session modification procedure to provide to
the PCRF new tunnel information.
4) Based on the tunnel information provided by the PDN GW, the PCRF initiates
a QoS rules provision procedure to the trusted non-3GPP access indicating the
new tunnel information.
# 7 Functional Description and Procedures for Un-trusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses
## 7.1 Control and User Plane Protocol Stacks
### 7.1.1 Protocol Options for S2b
The following protocol may be supported on S2b:
\- PMIPv6;
\- GTP.
Figures 7.1.1-1 and 7.1.1-2 illustrate the control plane for Mobility
Management (MM) and the user plane on S2b for the PMIPv6 and GTP variants of
S2b respectively.
**Legend:**
\- According to terms defined in PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8], the
functional entities terminating both the control and user planes are denoted
MAG in the non-3GPP IP access and LMA in the Gateway. LMA includes also the
function of a Home Agent.
\- The MM control plane stack is PMIPv6 (RFC 5213 [8]) over IPv6/IPv4.
\- The user plane carries remote IPv4/v6 packets over either an IPv4 or an
IPv6 transport network. Between the UE and the ePDG, packets are encapsulated
using IPSEC RFC 3948 [48].
\- The tunnelling layer implements GRE encapsulation applicable for PMIPv6.
\- **IPv4/IPv6:** This refers to network layer protocols. On the ePDG MAG user
plane this includes termination of the UE-MAG IP messages that may be handled
by the ePDG (e.g. DHCP) and forwarding of user plane IP packets between the
UE-MAG point-to-point logical link and the S2b tunnel for the UE.
Figure 7.1.1-1: Protocols for MM control and user planes of S2b for the PMIPv6
option
**Legend:**
\- **GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the control plane (GTP-C):** This protocol
tunnels signalling messages between the ePDG and the P-GW (S2b).
\- **GPRS Tunnelling Protocol for the user plane (GTP-U):** This protocol
tunnels user data between the ePDG and the P‑GW in the backbone network. GTP
shall encapsulate all end user IP packets.
\- **UDP/IP:** These are the backbone network protocols used for routing user
data and control signalling.
Figure 7.1.1-2: Protocols for MM control and user planes of S2b for the GTP
option
### 7.1.2 Protocol Options for S2c over Un-trusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses
The following protocols shall be supported for S2c over un-trusted non-3GPP IP
accesses:
\- DSMIPv6, with IPsec and IKEv2 used to secure mobility signalling, as
specified in RFC 4877 [22].
The figure below illustrates the control plane for Mobility Management (MM)
and the user plane.
**Legend:**
> \- According to terms defined in DSMIPv6 [10], the functional entities
> terminating both the control and user planes are denoted MN (Mobile Node) in
> the UE, and HA (Home Agent) in the Gateway.
>
> \- The MM control plane stack is DSMIPv6 [10] over IPv6/IPv4.
>
> \- The user plane carries remote IPv4/v6 packets over either an IPv4 or an
> IPv6 transport network. Between the UE and the ePDG, packets are
> encapsulated using IPSEC RFC 3948 [48].
>
> \- The tunnelling layer implements IP encapsulation applicable for MIPv6 as
> defined in DSMIPv6 [10]. In some cases the tunnelling layer may be
> transparent.

DSMIPv6 option
## 7.2 Initial Attach on S2b
### 7.2.1 Initial Attach with PMIPv6 on S2b
This clause is related to the case when the UE powers-on in an untrusted
non-3GPP IP access network via the PMIP based S2b interface.
PMIPv6 specification, RFC 5213 [8], is used to setup a PMIPv6 tunnel between
the ePDG and the PDN GW. It is assumed that MAG is collocated with ePDG. The
IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG provides a virtual point-to-point
link between the UE and the MAG functionality on the ePDG.
Figure 7.2.1-1: Initial attachment over PMIP based S2b for roaming, non-
roaming and LBO
NOTE 1: For GTP based S2b, procedure steps (A) to (E) are defined in clause
7.2.4.
NOTE 2: Before the UE initiates the setup of an IPsec tunnel with the ePDG it
configures an IP address from an untrusted non-3GPP IP access network. This
address is used for sending all IKEv2 [9] messages and as the source address
on the outer header of the IPsec tunnel.
The home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure.
\- In the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding
messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and
visa versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the
HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
\- In the home routed roaming and non-roaming case, the vPCRF and the 3GPP AAA
Proxy are not involved.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 3 does not
occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
This procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over an
untrusted non-3GPP access with PMIPv6 on S2b when the UE already has active
PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous
PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.
The UE may be authenticated and authorised to access the Untrusted Non-3GPP
Access network with an access network specific procedure. These procedures are
outside the scope of 3GPP.
1) The Access authentication procedure between UE and the 3GPP EPC may be
performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45]. In the roaming case signalling may be
routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the VPLMN, as specified in TS 23.234 [5]. As
part of the AAA exchange for network access authentication, the AAA/HSS and/or
the 3GPP AAA Proxy may return to the Non-3GPP IP Access a set of home/visited
operator\'s policies to be enforced on the usage of local IP address, or IPv6
prefix, allocated by the access system upon successful authentication.
Subscription data is provided to the Non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this
step.
2) The IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE. The UE may
indicate in a notification part of the IKEv2 authentication request that it
supports MOBIKE. The ePDG IP address to which the UE needs to form IPsec
tunnel is discovered via DNS query as specified in clause 4.5.4. The UE may
request connectivity to a specific PDN providing an APN, that is conveyed with
IKEv2 as specified in TS 33.402 [45]. For networks supporting multiple
mobility protocols, if there was any dynamic IPMS decision involved in this
step, the decision is stored in the 3GPP AAA Server. The PDN GW information is
returned as part of the reply from the 3GPP AAA Server to the ePDG as
described in clause 4.5.1. If the UE has provided an APN the ePDG verifies
that it is allowed by subscription. If the UE has not provided an APN the ePDG
uses the default APN. The PDN GW selection takes place at this point as
described in clause 4.5.1. This may entail an additional name resolution step,
issuing a request to a DNS Server. If there is no requested IP address in the
CFG_Request from the UE to the ePDG which indicates the attach is an initial
attach, the ePDG may perform a new PDN GW selection procedure as described in
clause 4.5.1, e.g. to allocate a PDN GW that allows for more efficient
routeing. The UE shall indicate the type of address(es) (IPv4 address or IPv6
prefix /address or both) in the CFG_Request sent to the ePDG during IKEv2
message exchange. If the PDN requires an additional authentication and
authorisation with an external AAA Server, the UE includes the authentication
credentials in this step as specified in RFC 4739 [50] and in TS 33.402 [45].
3) The ePDG sends the Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, APN, Access
Technology Type, Handover Indicator, GRE key for downlink traffic, UE Address
Info, Charging Characteristics, Additional Parameters) message to the PDN GW.
Access Technology Type option is set to a value matching the characteristics
of the non-3GPP IP access. Handover Indicator is set to indicate attachment
over a new interface. The proxy binding update message shall be secured. The
MN NAI identifies the UE. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value in
the case of a registration and a zero value in the case of a de-registration.
The APN is used by the PDN GW to determine which PDN to establish connectivity
for, in the case that the PDN GW supports multiple PDN connectivity. The ePDG
creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the ePDG supports multiple
PDN connections to a single APN. The UE Address Info shall be set based on the
CFG_Request in step 1 and subscription profile in the same way as the PDN type
is selected during the E‑UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4]. The Additional
Parameters include the authentication credentials for an additional
authentication and authorization with an external AAA server if it was
provided by the UE in step 2. The PDN GW performs the authentication and
authorization with the external AAA server if it is required to get access for
the given APN as specified in TS 33.402 [45].
4) The PDN GW initiates the IP CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the
PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
5) The selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity. The
3GPP AAA Server then informs the HSS of the PDN GW identity and APN associated
with the UE\'s PDN Connection. The message includes information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This information is
registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
6) The PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and creates a binding cache
entry for the UE. The PDN GW allocates an IP address for the UE. The PDN GW
then sends a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, UE Address Info, GRE Key for uplink
traffic, Charging ID) message to the ePDG, including the IP address(es)
allocated for the UE (identified by the MN NAI). If the corresponding Proxy
Binding Update contains the PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall
acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported. The
Charging ID is assigned for the PDN connection for charging correlation
purposes.
NOTE 3: If UE requests for both IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix, both are
allocated. If the PDN GW operator dictates the use of IPv4 address only or
IPv6 prefix only for this APN, the PDN GW shall allocate the only IPv4 address
or only IPv6 prefix to the UE. If the UE requests for only IPv4 address or
IPv6 prefix only one address/prefix is allocated accordingly.
NOTE 4: The ePDG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN
connection to the same APN or not.
7) After the Proxy Binding Update is successful, the ePDG is authenticated by
the UE and indicates to the UE that the authentication and authorization with
the external AAA server is successful.
8) The ePDG sends the final IKEv2 message with the IP address in IKEv2
Configuration payloads. The ePDG also includes the identity of the associated
PDN (APN) in the IDr payload of IKEv2. In case the UE provided APN to the ePDG
in the earlier steps, the ePDG shall not change the provided APN.
9) IP connectivity from the UE to the PDN GW is now setup. Any packet in the
uplink direction is tunnelled to the ePDG by the UE using the IPSec tunnel.
The ePDG then tunnels the packet to the PDN GW. From the PDN GW normal IP-
based routing takes place. In the downlink direction, the packet for UE (HoA)
arrives at the PDN GW. The PDN GW tunnels the packet based on the binding
cache entry to the ePDG. The ePDG then tunnels the packet to the UE via proper
IPsec tunnel.
### 7.2.2 Void
### 7.2.3 Initial Attach Procedure with PMIPv6 on S2b and Chained S2b and
PMIP-based S8
This procedure is described in clause 6.2.4.
### 7.2.4 Initial Attach with GTP on S2b
This clause is related to the case when the UE powers-on in an untrusted
non-3GPP IP access network via the GTP based S2b interface.
GTPv2 (see TS 29.274 [57]) is used to setup GTP tunnel(s) between the ePDG and
the PDN GW. The IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG provides a virtual
point-to-point link between the UE and the ePDG.
Figure 7.2.4-1: Initial attachment over GTP based S2b for roaming, non-roaming
and LBO
The home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure.
\- In the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding
messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and
visa versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the
HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
\- In the home routed roaming and non-roaming case, the vPCRF and the 3GPP AAA
Proxy are not involved.
This procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over an
untrusted non-3GPP access with GTP on S2b when the UE already has active PDN
connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous PDN
connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.
The UE may be authenticated and authorised to access the Untrusted Non-3GPP
Access network with an access network specific procedure. These procedures are
outside the scope of 3GPP.
A.1) Step A.1 is the same as Step A of clause 7.2.1, with the following
addition:
\- upon a successful authorization, the 3GPP AAA server returns the following
additional informations, regardless of which protocol variant the ePDG will
select on S2b : APN-AMBR, static QoS Profile and Trace Information (Trace
Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity) if applicable;
NOTE 1: Sending the static QoS profile to the ePDG enables the ePDG to enforce
QoS policies based on information received via AAA infrastructure as specified
in clause 4.3.4. When GTP is used over S2b, this also allows the PGW to
receive the QoS parameters possibly modified by the 3GPP AAA Proxy (when the
ePDG is located in the VPLMN) to enforce QoS limitations according to the
local policies and the roaming agreement with the home operator. The ePDG does
not perform rate enforcement based on APN-AMBR.
NOTE 2: This also allows to align the GTP operations on S5/S8/S2b, i.e. the
PGW receives those parameters within GTP signalling on all GTP interfaces.
B.1) The ePDG sends a Create Session Request (IMSI, APN, RAT type, ePDG TEID
for control plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, Default EPS
Bearer QoS, ePDG Address for the user plane, ePDG TEID of the user plane, APN-
AMBR, Selection Mode, Dual Address Bearer Flag, Trace Information, Charging
Characteristics, Additional Parameters) message to the PGW. The RAT type
indicates the non-3GPP IP access technology type. The PDN Type shall be set
based on the CFG_Request in step 1 and subscription profile in the same way as
the PDN type is selected during the E‑UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4].
The ePDG shall set the Dual Address Bearer Flag when the PDN type is set to
IPv4v6 and all SGSNs which the UE may be handed over to are Release 8 or above
supporting dual addressing, which is determined based on node pre-
configuration by the operator. The ePDG shall include Trace Information if PDN
GW trace is activated. The Additional Parameters include the authentication
credentials for an additional authentication and authorization with an
external AAA server if it was provided by the UE before this step. The PDN GW
performs the authentication and authorization with the external AAA server if
it is required to get access for the given APN.
The PGW creates a new entry in its bearer context table and generates a
Charging Id. The new entry allows the PGW to route user plane PDUs between the
ePDG and the packet data network and to start charging.
NOTE 3: The EPS Bearer Identity and Default EPS Bearer QoS parameters convey
the S2b bearer identity and the default S2b bearer QoS.
C.1) Step C.1 is the same as Step C of clause 7.2.1, with the following
addition:
\- when informing the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity, the selected PDN
GW also indicates the selected S2b protocol variant (here GTP); this allows
the option for the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy not to return to the PDN
GW PMIP specific parameters (e.g. static QoS Profile, Trace Information, APN-
AMBR) if GTP is used over S2b; the PDN GW shall ignore those parameters if
received from the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy.
D.1) The PDN GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the user
plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control plane, PDN
Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR, Charging ID,
Cause) message to the ePDG, including the IP address(es) allocated for the UE.
The PDN GW selects the PDN type to be used in the same way as done during the
E-UTRAN Initial Attach in TS 23.401 [4].
The PGW may initiate the creation of dedicated bearers on GTP based S2b (like
it may do it on GTP based S5/S8 for an Attach on 3GPP access).
NOTE 4: If the UE requests for both IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix, both are
allocated. If the PDN GW operator dictates the use of IPv4 address only or
IPv6 prefix only for this APN, the PDN GW shall allocate the only IPv4 address
or only IPv6 prefix to the UE. If the UE requests for only IPv4 address or
IPv6 prefix only one address/prefix is allocated accordingly.
E.1) Step E.1 is the same as Step E of clause 7.2.1, but with GTP tunnel(s).
## 7.3 Initial Attach Procedure for S2c in Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access
This clause is related to the case when the UE powers-on in an untrusted
network and host-based mobility management mechanism is used to establish IP
connectivity and to perform inter-access Handover. Dual Stack MIPv6 [10] is
used for supporting mobility over S2c interface.
Figure 7.3-1: Initial attachment from Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with
DSMIPv6
The non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-2), Roaming (Figure 4.2.3-3) and LBO (Figure
4.2.3-5) are all covered in this procedure. In the Roaming and LBO case, the
ePDG communicates with the 3GPP AAA Server by way of the 3GPP AAA Proxy,
functioning as a relay for AAA messages. In the LBO case, the PDN GW in the
VPLMN interacts with the PCRF by means of the vPCRF. In the non-roaming case,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy and vPCRF are not involved.
This procedure is also used to establish the first PDN connection over an
untrusted non-3GPP access with DSMIPv6 on S2c when the UE already has active
PDN connections only over a 3GPP access and wishes to establish simultaneous
PDN connections to different APNs over multiple accesses.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 6 does not
occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
1) The Access authentication procedure between UE and the 3GPP EPC may be
performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45]. As part of the AAA exchange for
network access authentication, the AAA/HSS and/or the 3GPP AAA Proxy may
return to the Non-3GPP IP Access a set of home/visited operator\'s policies to
be enforced on the usage of local IP address, or IPv6 prefix, allocated by the
access system upon successful authentication. Subscription data is provided to
the Non-3GPP IP Access by the HSS/AAA in this step. After the authentication,
UE is configured with Local IP Address from the access network domain. This
address is used for sending all IKEv2 [9] messages and as the source address
on the outer header of the IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG.
2) The IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE. The UE may
indicate in a notification part of the IKEv2 authentication request that it
supports MOBIKE. The ePDG IP address to which the UE needs to form IPsec
tunnel is discovered via DNS query as specified in clause 4.5.4. The procedure
is as described in TS 33.234 [7].
3) The ePDG sends the final IKEv2 message with the assigned IP address in
IKEv2 Configuration payloads.
4) IPsec Tunnel between the UE and ePDG is now setup.
5) A security association is established between UE and PDN GW to secure the
DS-MIPv6 messages between UE and PDN GW. This step is performed as specified
in step 4 of clause 6.3. During this step an IPv6 home network prefix is
assigned by the PDN GW to the UE as defined in RFC 5026 [40]. After the IPv6
home network prefix is assigned, UE constructs a home address from it via
auto-configuration.
6) The UE sends the Binding Update (IP Addresses (HoA, CoA)) message to the
PDN GW. The Binding Update is as specified in RFC 5555 [10]. The UE may
request an IPv4 Home Address in this step. The UE shall inform the PDN GW that
the whole home prefix shall be moved.
7) The PDN GW executes a IP‑CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF
as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The message from the PDG GW includes at least
the HoA and the CoA. The message may also include a permanent UE identity and
an APN string.
The PCRF decides on the PCC rules and Event Triggers and provisions them to
the PDN GW. The PDN GW installs the received PCC rules.
8) The PDN GW processes the binding update and creates a binding cache entry
for the UE. The PDN GW allocates an IPv4 home address for the UE if requested
by the UE in step 5 and allowed by the subscription profile received as it is
specified in the E‑UTRAN attach procedure in TS 23.401 [4]. The PDN GW then
sends a Binding Ack to the UE, including the IPv4 home address allocated for
the UE.
9) The IP Connectivity is now setup.
## 7.4 Detach and PDN Disconnection for S2b
### 7.4.1 UE/ePDG-initiated Detach Procedure and UE-Requested PDN
Disconnection with PMIPv6 on S2b
#### 7.4.1.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case
The procedure in this clause applies to Detach Procedures, initiated by UE or
ePDG initiated detach procedure, and to the UE-requested PDN disconnection
procedure when PMIPv6 is used on the S2b interface.
The UE can initiate the Detach procedure, e.g. when the UE is power off. The
ePDG may initiate the Detach procedure due to administration reason or the
IKEv2 tunnel releasing.
For multiple PDN connectivity, this detach procedure shall be repeated for
each PDN connected.
Figure 7.4.1-1: UE/ePDG-initiated detach procedure with PMIPv6 on S2b
NOTE: For GTP based S2b, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined in clause
7.4.3.1.
The home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure. In the LBO case, the
3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding messages from the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and visa versa. Messages
between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the HPLMN are forwarded by
the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In the non-roaming case, the vPCRF and the 3GPP AAA
Proxy are not involved.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 4 does not
occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
1) IKEv2 tunnel release triggers PMIP tunnel release.
2) The MAG in the ePDG sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, APN, lifetime=0)
message to the PDN GW. The MN NAI identifies the UE. When only one PDN
connection to the given APN is allowed the APN is needed in order to determine
which PDN to deregister the UE from, as some PDN GWs may support multiple
PDNs. When multiple PDN connections to the given APN are supported, the APN
and the PDN connection identity are needed in order to determine which PDN to
deregister the UE from. The lifetime value set to zero, indicates this is a
PMIP de-registration.
3) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE
no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
4) The PDN GW deletes the IP CAN session associated with the UE and executes a
PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
5) The PDN GW deletes all existing entries for the indicated HoA from its
Binding Cache and sends a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, lifetime=0) message to
the MAG in the ePDG. The PDN GW sends a Proxy Binding Ack message to the ePDG.
The MN NAI value and the lifetime=0 values indicate that the UE has been
successfully deregistered.
6) Non-3GPP specific resource release procedure is executed.
#### 7.4.1.2 Chained PMIP-based S8-S2b Roaming Case
This procedure is described in clause 6.4.1.2.
### 7.4.2 HSS/AAA-initiated Detach Procedure with PMIPv6 on S2b
#### 7.4.2.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case
HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure when PMIPv6 is used on the S2b interface is
illustrated in Figure 7.4.2-1. The HSS can initiate the procedure e.g. when
the user\'s subscription is removed. The 3GPP AAA Server can initiate the
procedure, e.g. instruction from O&M, timer for re-authentication/re-
authorization expired.
If the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure has been initiated to delete the UE
from the Evolved Packet Core, the HSS/AAA server shall initiate the detach
procedure for each of the access systems to which the UE is registered.
Figure 7.4.2-1: HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with PMIPv6 on S2b
NOTE 1: For GTP based S2b, procedure step (A) is defined in clause 7.4.4.1.
NOTE 2: AAA proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming
(Figure 4.2.3-1) and local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4).
1) The HSS/AAA sends a detach indication message to the ePDG to detach a
specific UE.
2) This include the procedure after step1 as Figure 7.4.1-1.
For multiple PDN connectivity, this step shall be repeated for each PDN
connected.
3) The ePDG sends a Detach Ack message to the 3GPP AAA Server. If the detach
procedure was initiated from the 3GPP AAA Server and if the UE no longer has
any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as
described in clause 12.1.2. If the detach procedure was initiated by HSS, the
3GPP AAA Server replies to the HSS as described in clause 12.1.3.
NOTE 3: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW.
The PDN GW does not remove the PMIP tunnels on S2b, since the ePDG is
responsible for removing the PMIP tunnels on S2b. The PDN GW acknowledges the
receipt of the detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
#### 7.4.2.2 Chained PMIP-based S8-S2b Roaming Case
This procedure is described in clause 6.4.2.2.
### 7.4.3 UE/ePDG-initiated Detach Procedure and UE-Requested PDN
Disconnection with GTP on S2b
#### 7.4.3.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case
the UE-requested PDN disconnection procedure when GTP is used on the S2b
interface.
The UE can initiate the Detach procedure, e.g. when the UE is power off. The
ePDG may initiate the Detach procedure due to administration reason or the
IKEv2 tunnel releasing.
For multiple PDN connectivity, this detach procedure shall be repeated for
each PDN connected.
Figure 7.4.3-1: UE/ePDG-initiated detach procedure with GTP on S2b
The home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are supported as specified in clause 7.4.1.
A.1) The ePDG releases this particular PDN connection and sends a Delete
Session Request (Linked EPS Bearer ID) message for this PDN connection to the
PDN GW.
B.1) The PDN GW acknowledges with a Delete Session Response (Cause) message.
### 7.4.4 HSS/AAA-initiated Detach Procedure with GTP on S2b
#### 7.4.4.1 Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local Breakout Case
HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure when GTP is used on the S2b interface is
illustrated in Figure 7.4.4-1. The HSS can initiate the procedure e.g. when
the user\'s subscription is removed. The 3GPP AAA Server can initiate the
procedure, e.g. instruction from O&M, timer for re-authentication/re-
authorization expired.
If the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure has been initiated to delete the UE
from the Evolved Packet Core, the HSS/AAA server shall initiate the detach
procedure for each of the access systems to which the UE is registered.
Figure 7.4.4-1: HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure with GTP on S2b
A.1) For multiple PDN connectivity, this step shall be repeated for each PDN
connected.
NOTE: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW. The
PDN GW does not remove the GTP tunnels on S2b, since the ePDG is responsible
for removing those tunnels on S2b. The PDN GW acknowledges the receipt of the
detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
## 7.5 Detach and PDN Disconnection for S2c in Un-trusted Non-3GPP IP Access
### 7.5.1 General
This clause is related to the cases where at least one DSMIPv6 PDN
disconnection procedure is performed. In case of detach the DSMIPv6 PDN
disconnection is executed for all the existing PDNs connections, while in the
case of disconnecting a single PDN connection the DSMIPv6 PDN disconnection is
executed only for the individual PDN connection.
The DSMIPv6 PDN disconnection procedure is on a per PDN basis and allows:
\- the UE to inform the network that it requests to release a S2c based PDN
connection; and
\- the network to inform the UE that a S2c based PDN connection is
disconnected.
The UE may be disconnected from a PDN either explicitly or implicitly:
\- Explicit PDN disconnection: The network or the UE explicitly requests
detach and signal with each other;
\- Implicit PDN disconnection: The network disconnects the UE from a PDN,
without notifying the UE. This is typically the case when the network presumes
that it is not able to communicate with the UE, e.g. due to radio conditions.
Three PDN disconnection procedures are provided when the UE accesses the EPS
through S2c:
\- UE-Initiated PDN disconnection Procedure;
\- AAA/HSS- initiated detach Procedure.
\- PDN GW-initiated PDN disconnection Procedure.
### 7.5.2 UE-Initiated PDN disconnection Procedure
The PDN disconnection procedure when initiated by the UE is illustrated in
Figure 7.5.2-1. In case of detaching the UE from EPS, the procedure defined in
this clause must be repeated for each PDN.
In the non-roaming case, none of the optional entities in Figure 7.5.2-1 are
involved. The optional entities are involved in other cases. In the roaming
cases, however, the 3GPP AAA Proxy relays all interaction between the 3GPP AAA
Server in the HPLMN and the PDN GW in the VPLMN.
Figure 7.5.2-1: UE-initiated S2c PDN disconnection procedure in Untrusted
Non-3GPP Access Network
Non-roaming (figure 4.2.2-2), home routed roaming (figure 4.2.3-3) and Local
Breakout (figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The AAA proxy
and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local Breakout.
In non-roaming scenarios, the AAA proxy and vPCRF are not involved.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 3 does not
occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
1\. If the UE wants to terminate a S2c session, it shall send a de-
registration Binding Update (Lifetime=0, IP Addresses (HoA, CoA)) message to
the PDN GW as specified in RFC 5555 [10].
2\. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE
no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
3\. If there is an active PCC session for the UE, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-
Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in
TS 23.203 [19].
4\. The PDN GW shall send a Binding Acknowledgement to the UE as specified in
RFC 5555 [10].
5\. The UE terminates the IKEv2 security association for the given PDN as
defined in RFC 5996 [9].
6\. If after step 5 the UE has no other PDN sessions, the UE should terminate
the IPSEC tunnel to the ePDG according to RFC 5996 [9].
7\. After IPsec tunnel termination, non-3GPP specific resource release
procedure may be executed.
### 7.5.3 HSS / AAA-initiated Detach Procedure
The Detach procedure when initiated by the HSS/AAA is illustrated in Figure
7.5.3-1. The Detach procedure defined in this clause must be repeated for each
PDN.
If the HSS/AAA-initiated detach procedure has been initiated to delete the UE
from the Evolved Packet Core, the HSS/AAA server shall initiate the detach
procedure for each of the access systems to which the UE is registered.
In the implicit detach, steps 2, 3 and 6 of Figure 7.5.3-1, are omitted.
Figure 7.5.3-1: AAA/HSS-initiated S2c detach procedure in Untrusted Non-3GPP
Access Network
Non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-2), home routed roaming (figure 4.2.3-3) and Local
Breakout (figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The AAA proxy
and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local Breakout.
In non-roaming scenarios, the AAA proxy and vPCRF are not involved.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 4 does not
occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
1\. If the HSS/AAA wants to request the immediate termination of a S2c session
for a given UE and a given PDN, it shall send a Session Termination message to
the PDN GW.
2\. The PDN GW sends a detach request message.
3\. The UE shall acknowledge the detach request.
NOTE 1: How the detach request and acknowledge messages are implemented is a
stage 3 issue.
4\. If there is an active PCC session for the UE, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-
Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in
TS 23.203 [19].
5\. The PDN GW shall acknowledge the termination of the S2c session to the
3GPP AAA Server. If the detach procedure was initiated from the 3GPP AAA
Server and if the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2. If the detach
procedure was initiated by HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server replies to the HSS as
described in clause 12.1.3.
6\. The PDN GW or the UE terminates the IKEv2 security association for the
given PDN as defined in RFC 5996 [9].
7\. If after step 6 the UE has no other PDN sessions, the UE should terminate
the IPSEC tunnel to the ePDG according to RFC 5996 [9].
8\. After IPsec tunnel termination, non-3GPP specific resource release
procedure may be executed.
NOTE 2: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to ePDG. The
HSS/AAA should wait to receive acknowledgement(s) from PDN GW(s) before
sending the detach indication message to the ePDG. The ePDG releases the IPSEC
tunnels to the UE and acknowledges the receipt of the detach indication
message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
### 7.5.4 PDN GW-initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure
The PDN Disconnection procedure when initiated by the PDN GW is illustrated in
Figure 7.5.4-1.
Figure 7.5.4-1: PDN GW- initiated PDN Disconnection S2c procedure in Untrusted
Non-3GPP Access Network
Non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-2) and Local
Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases are supported by this procedure. The 3GPP AAA
proxy and vPCRF are only used in the case of home routed roaming and Local
Breakout. In non-roaming scenarios, the 3GPP AAA proxy and vPCRF are not
involved.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional step 3 does not
occur. Instead, the PDN GW may employ static configured policies.
static configured policies.
If the PDN GW-initiated PDN Disconnection Procedure is triggered by the UE
binding lifetime expiration (Implicit PDN disconnection procedure), steps 1
and 2 may be omitted.
1\. In the explicit detach procedure the PDN GW shall send a detach request
message.
2\. In the explicit detach procedure, the UE shall acknowledge the detach
request.
NOTE: How the detach request and acknowledge messages are implemented is a
stage 3 detail.
3\. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the
PDN GW is in the VPLMN, signalling may be routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the
VPLMN. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP
AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
4\. If there is an active PCC session for the UE, the PDN GW shall execute a
PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
5\. The PDN GW or the UE may terminate the IKEv2 security association for the
given PDN as defined in RFC 5996 [9].
6\. After IKEv2 SA termination, non-3GPP specific resource release procedure
may be executed.
## 7.6 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN
### 7.6.1 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with PMIPv6 on S2b
NOTE: The PDN GW treats each MN-ID+APN as a separate binding and may allocate
a new IP address/prefix for each binding.
This clause is related to the case when the UE has an established PDN
connection over untrusted non-3GPP access with PMIPv6 on S2b and wishes to
establish one or more additional PDN connections over such untrusted access.
This procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN
over untrusted non-3GPP access with PMIPv6 on S2b when the UE is
simultaneously connected to such untrusted access and a 3GPP access, and the
UE already has active PDN connections over both the accesses. Since PMIPv6 is
used to establish connectivity with the additional PDN, the UE establishes a
separate SWu instance (i.e. a separate IPSec tunnel) for each additional PDN.
There can be more than one PDN connection per APN if both the ePDG and the PDN
GW support that feature. When multiple PDN connections to a given APN are
supported, during the establishment of a new PDN connection, the ePDG creates
and sends a PDN Connection identity to the PDN GW. The PDN connection identity
is unique in the scope of the UE and the APN within an ePDG, i.e. the MN-ID,
the APN, and the PDN connection identity together identify a PDN connection
within an ePDG. In order to be able to identify a specific established PDN
connection, both the ePDG and the PDN GW shall store the PDN Connection
identity. Sending the PDN connection identity is an indication that the ePDG
supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN and the PDN GW shall be able
to indicate if it supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. Between
the UE and the ePDG the IPSec SA associated with the PDN connection identifies
the PDN connection.
Figure 7.6.1-1: UE-initiated connectivity to additional PDN from Un-trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access with PMIPv6
1) The UE has performed the Initial S2b Attach procedure as defined in clause
7.2.1, Figure 7.2.1-1 and has an established PDN connection.
2) The UE repeats the procedure of clause 7.2.1, Figure 7.2.1-1 for each
additional PDN the UE wants to connect to, with the following exceptions:
a) The IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure for each additional PDN connection
is initiated with the ePDG that was selected in step 1;
b) The APN information corresponding to the requested PDN connection is
conveyed with IKEv2 as specified in TS 33.402 [45];
c) For network supporting multiple mobility protocols, if there was any
dynamic IPMS decision in step 1, the AAA/HSS enforces the same IPMS decision
for each additional PDN connection.
### 7.6.2 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN from Un-trusted Non-3GPP
IP Access with DSMIPv6 on S2c
This clause is related to the case when the UE powers-on in an untrusted
network and host-based mobility management mechanism is used for obtaining
connectivity. Dual Stack MIPv6 [10] is used for supporting mobility over S2c
interface. This case covers the scenario when UE obtains connectivity with one
or more additional PDNs at any time after initial attach Since host-based
mobility mechanisms are used, the procedure is similar to the initial attach
procedure. This procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an
additional PDN over untrusted non-3GPP access with DSMIPv6 on S2c when the UE
is simultaneously connected to such untrusted access and a 3GPP access, and
the UE already has active PDN connections over both the accesses.
NOTE: Based on the MN-ID and APN, the PDN GW may allocate a new IP
address/prefix for a new binding.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="2.2493055555555554in"}
Figure 7.6.2-1: UE-initiated connectivity to additional PDN from Un-trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6
When the initial attachment is performed, the UE performs procedures described
in clause 7.3, Figure 7.3-1, to obtain connectivity with a PDN GW and a
specific PDN. If at any time the UE wants to obtain connectivity with
additional PDNs, since DSMIPv6 is used to obtain connectivity, the UE repeats
only steps 4-8 of Figure 7.3-1.
1) The UE performs initial S2c PDN Attach procedure as defined in clause 7.3,
Figure 7.3-1.
2) The UE repeats steps 4-8 of clause 7.3, Figure 7.3-1 for each additional
PDN the UE wants to connect to. This step can be performed and repeated at any
time after step 1 for one or multiple PDNs.
### 7.6.3 UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN with GTP on S2b
NOTE: The PDN GW treats each IMSI+APN as a separate PDN connection and may
allocate a new IP address/prefix for each PDN connection.
This clause is related to the case when the UE has an established PDN
connection over untrusted non-3GPP access with GTP on S2b and wishes to
establish one or more additional PDN connections over such untrusted access.
This procedure is also used to request for connectivity to an additional PDN
over untrusted non-3GPP access with GTP on S2b when the UE is simultaneously
connected to such untrusted access and a 3GPP access, and the UE already has
active PDN connections over both the accesses. Since GTP is used to establish
connectivity with the additional PDN, the UE establishes a separate SWu
instance (i.e. a separate IPSec tunnel) for each additional PDN.
There can be more than one PDN connection per APN when GTP is used between the
ePDG and the PDN GW. During the establishment of a new PDN connection, the
ePDG allocates and sends a default EPS bearer ID to the PDN GW. The default
EPS bearer ID is unique in the scope of the UE within an ePDG, i.e. the IMSI
and the default EPS bearer ID together identify a PDN connection within an
ePDG. In order to be able to identify a specific established PDN connection,
both the ePDG and the PDN GW shall store the default EPS bearer ID. Between
the UE and the ePDG the IPSec SA associated with the PDN connection identifies
the PDN connection.
Figure 7.6.3-1: UE-initiated connectivity to additional PDN from Un-trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access with GTP
1) The UE has performed the Initial GTP based S2b Attach procedure as defined
in clause 7.2.4, Figure 7.2.4-1 and has an established PDN connection.
2) The UE repeats the procedure of clause 7.2.4, Figure 7.2.4-1 for each
additional PDN the UE wants to connect to, with the following exceptions:
a) The IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure for each additional PDN connection
is initiated with the ePDG that was selected in step 1;
b) The APN information corresponding to the requested PDN connection is
conveyed with IKEv2 as specified in TS 33.402 [45];
c) For network supporting multiple mobility protocols, if there was any
dynamic IPMS decision in step 1, the AAA/HSS enforces the same IPMS decision
for each additional PDN connection.
## 7.7 Void
## 7.8 S2c Bootstrapping via DSMIPv6 Home Link over an Un-Trusted Access
When the UE is connected on an un-trusted non-3GPP access considered to be
DSMIPv6 home link for the UE based on clause 4.5.6, the UE may trigger the
establishment of S2c IKEv2 SA, e.g. to optimize future handovers to other
accesses using S2c. For each PDN connection, the S2c IKEv2 SA establishment
has to be performed separately.
NOTE: An un-trusted non-3GPP access can be defined as DSMIPv6 Home Link in
addition to the 3GPP access.
Once the UE is attached to the PDN over the un-trusted non-3GPP access, the
procedure describing the bootstrapping is in clause 15.1.
## 7.9 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation
### 7.9.1 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with PMIPv6 on S2b
This procedure is performed to release all the resources associated with the
PDN address, for example, due to IP CAN session modification requests from the
PCRF or due to handover Non-3GPP to 3GPP. When it is performed for an
handover, the connections associated with the PDN address are released, but
the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.
Figure 7.9-1: PDN GW Initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with PMIPv6 on
s2b
The PDN GW initiated resource allocation deactivation procedure for S2b PMIP
reference point is defined in the following.
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation
Deactivation procedure may for example be triggered due to \'IP CAN session
Modification procedure\', as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, the
resources associated with the PDN connection in the PDN GW are released.
The PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation can also be triggered
during handovers from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.
2\. The PDN GW sends a Binding Revocation Indication message to the trusted
non-3GPP IP access.
3\. The IKEv2 tunnel release is triggered from the ePDG if all bearers
belonging to the PDN connection are released.
4\. The resources may be released in the non-3GPP IP access.
5 The ePDG send a Buinding Revocation Acknowledgement message to the PDN GW.
6\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are
released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN
disconnection. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
7\. The PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was
successfully enforced by completing the PCRF-initiated IP CAN Session
Modification procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
procedure as defined in TS 23.203 [19], proceeding after the completion of IP
CAN bearer signalling.
### 7.9.2 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with GTP on S2b
This procedure can be used to deactivate a dedicated bearer or deactivate all
bearers belonging to a PDN address, for example, due to IP CAN session
modification requests from the PCRF or due to handover from Non-3GPP to 3GPP
access. If the default bearer belonging to a PDN connection is deactivated,
the PDN GW deactivates all bearers belonging to the PDN connection.
When it is performed for a handover, the connections associated with the PDN
address are released, but the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.
Figure 7.9.2-1: PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation with GTP on S2b
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (Figure 4.2.2-1), Roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) cases. In the Local Breakout
case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the
non-roaming and home routed roaming cases, the vPCRF is not involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the PDN GW and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 7.9.2.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured within the PDN GW.
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Bearer Deactivation
procedure may for example be triggered due to \'IP CAN session Modification
procedure\', as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, the resources
associated with the PDN connection in the PDN GW are released.
The PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation can also be triggered
during handovers from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.
2\. The PDN GW sends a Delete Bearer Request message (EPS Bearer Identity or
Linked EPS Bearer Identity, Cause) to the ePDG. The Linked EPS Bearer Identity
shall be present and set to the identity of the default bearer associated with
the PDN connection if the PDN GW requests to release all the bearers of the
PDN connection. Otherwise, the EPS Bearer Identity shall be present and set to
the identity of the dedicated S2b bearer(s) to release if the PDN GW requests
to deactivate dedicated S2b bearer(s).
3a. The IKEv2 tunnel release is triggered from the ePDG if all bearers
belonging to the PDN connection are released.
3b. The resources may be released in the non-3GPP IP access.
4\. The ePDG deletes the bearer contexts related to the Delete Bearer Request,
and acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the PDN GW by sending a Delete
Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity) message.
5\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are
released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN
disconnection. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the
3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
6\. The PDN GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated EPS
bearer. If the dedicated bearer deactivation procedure was triggered by
receiving a PCC decision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the
PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was successfully enforced by
completing the PCRF-initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure or the
PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203
[19], proceeding after the completion of IP CAN bearer signalling.
## 7.10 Dedicated S2b bearer activation with GTP on S2b
The dedicated bearer activation procedure for GTP based S2b is depicted in
figure 7.10-1.
Figure 7.10-1: Dedicated S2b Bearer Activation Procedure with GTP on S2b
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS
policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the initial steps of the
PCRF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure or to the PCRF response
in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS
23.203 [19], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP CAN Bearer
Signalling. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS
policy.
2\. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to assign the EPS Bearer QoS, i.e., it
assigns the values to the bearer level QoS parameters QCI, ARP, GBR and MBR.
The PGW generates a Charging Id for the dedicated bearer. The PDN GW sends a
Create Bearer Request message (IMSI, EPS Bearer QoS, TFT, PDN GW Address for
the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, Charging Id, LBI) to the ePDG.
The Linked EPS Bearer Identity (LBI) is the EPS Bearer Identity of the default
bearer.
3\. The ePDG selects an EPS Bearer Identity, which has not yet been assigned
to the UE. The ePDG then stores the EPS Bearer Identity and links the
dedicated bearer to the default bearer indicated by the Linked EPS Bearer
Identity (LBI). The ePDG uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to determine
the mapping of uplink traffic flows to the S2b bearer. The ePDG then
acknowledges the S2b bearer activation to the PGW by sending a Create Bearer
Response (EPS Bearer Identity, ePDG Address for the user plane, ePDG TEID of
the user plane) message.
4\. If the dedicated bearer activation procedure was triggered by a PCC
Decision Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF
whether the requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or not,
allowing the completion of the PCRF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification
procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as
defined in TS 23.203 [19], after the completion of IP CAN bearer signalling.
NOTE 1: The exact signalling of step 1 and 4 (e.g. for local break-out) is
outside the scope of this specification. This signalling and its interaction
with the dedicated bearer activation procedure are to be specified in TS
23.203 [19]. Steps 1 and 4 are included here only for completeness.
NOTE 2: This procedure does not aim at providing QoS differentiation over
untrustred non 3GPP access networks. It is used to establish the same number
of bearers on S2b that were or will be established when the UE hands over
from/to a 3GPP access.
## 7.11 S2b bearer modification with GTP on S2b
### 7.11.1 PDN GW initiated bearer modification
The PDN GW initiated bearer modification procedure for a GTP based S2b is
depicted in figure 7.11.1-1. This procedure is used to update the TFT for an
active default or dedicated S2b bearer, or in cases when one or several of the
EPS Bearer QoS parameters QCI, GBR, MBR or ARP are modified (including the QCI
or the ARP of the default S2b bearer e.g. due to the HSS Initiated Subscribed
QoS Modification procedure, as described in clause 7.11.2).
Figure 7.11.1-1: S2b Bearer Modification Procedure with GTP on S2b
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS
policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the initial steps of the
PCRF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure or to the PCRF response
in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS
23.203 [19], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP CAN Bearer
Signalling. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS
policy.
2\. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to determine that a service data flow
shall be aggregated to or removed from an active S2b bearer or that the
authorized QoS of a service data flow has changed. The PDN GW generates the
TFT and updates the EPS Bearer QoS to match the traffic flow aggregate. The
PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request (EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer
QoS, TFT) message to the ePDG.
3\. The ePDG uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to determine the mapping
of traffic flows to the S2b bearer and acknowledges the S2b bearer
modification to the PGW by sending an Update Bearer Response (EPS Bearer
Identity) message.
4\. If the Bearer modification procedure was triggered by a PCC Decision
Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the
requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or not by sending a
Provision Ack message allowing the completion of the PCRF-Initiated IP CAN
Session Modification procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session
Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203 [19], after the completion of
IP CAN bearer signalling.
NOTE: The exact signalling of step 1 and 4 (e.g. for local break-out) is
outside the scope of this specification. This signalling and its interaction
with the bearer activation procedure are to be specified in TS 23.203 [19].
Steps 1 and 4 are included here only for completeness.
### 7.11.2 HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification
The HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification for a GTP-based S2b is depicted
in figure 7.11.2-1.
Figure 7.11.2-1: HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification
1\. The HSS updates the User Profile as specified in clause 12.2.1.
2\. If the QCI and/or ARP and/or subscribed APN-AMBR has been modified and
there is a related active PDN connection with the modified QoS Profile, the
ePDG sends the Modify Bearer Command (EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN
AMBR) message to the PGW. The EPS Bearer Identity identifies the default
bearer of the affected PDN connection. The EPS Bearer QoS contains the EPS
subscribed QoS profile to be updated.
3\. If PCC infrastructure is deployed, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the
updated EPS Bearer QoS. The PCRF sends new updated PCC decision to the PDN GW.
This corresponds to the PCEF-initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure
as defined in TS 23.203 [19].
The PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and the QoS parameters (QCI and ARP)
associated with the default bearer in the response to the PDN GW as defined in
TS 23.203 [19].
4\. The PDN GW modifies the default bearer of each PDN connection
corresponding to the APN for which subscribed QoS has been modified. If the
subscribed ARP parameter has been changed, the PDN GW shall also modify all
dedicated S2 bearers having the previously subscribed ARP value unless
superseded by PCRF decision. The PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request
(EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, TFT, APN AMBR) message to the ePDG.
5\. The ePDG acknowledges the bearer modification to the PDN GW by sending an
Update Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity) message. If the bearer
modification fails the PDN GW deletes the concerned S2b Bearer.
8\. The PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was
enforced or not by sending a Provision Ack message.
# 8 Handovers without Optimizations Between 3GPP Accesses and Non-3GPP IP
Accesses
## 8.1 Common Aspects for Handover without Optimizations for Multiple PDNs
This clause describes the common aspects of handover for connectivity with
multiple PDNs.
The support of multiple PDNs has the following impacts on the handover
procedures for single PDN connectivity:
\- Upon handover from 3GPP access to non-3GPP access, and from non-3GPP access
to 3GPP access, if the UE has multiple PDN connections to different APNs in
the source access and the UE is capable of routing different simultaneously
active PDN connections through different access networks, the UE may transfer
from the source to the target access all the PDN connections that were active
in source access before handover or only a subset of them, with the
restriction that multiple PDN connections to the same APN shall be kept in one
access.
\- Upon handover from 3GPP access to non-3GPP access, and from non-3GPP access
to another non-3GPP access, using S2a or S2b, during the access authentication
the HSS/AAA returns to the Trusted Non-3GPP Access or the ePDG the PDN GW
identity and the associated APN for each PDN the UE is connected to. For
non-3GPP accesses that support UE to establish connectivity to PDNs after
attach, the UE performs an attach to the target non-3GPP access indicating
that it is a handover, resulting in the UE being connected to one PDN, and the
UE establishes connectivity with the remaining PDNs that are being transferred
from the 3GPP system using the UE-initiated Connectivity to Additional PDN
procedure.
\- If the UE hands over between 3GPP access and a non-3GPP access and the UE
has more than one PDN connection to a given APN in the source access and
multiple PDN connections to a single APN are not supported via the target
access, only one PDN connection to the given APN will be established in the
target access. In this case, the following applies:
a) If dynamic PCC is deployed and the PCRF receives a Gateway Control Session
Establishment Request from the target BBERF indicating an IP-CAN type
different from 3GPP access, the PCRF shall select one of the IP-CAN sessions
for this APN and continue with the BBERF relocation procedure for that PDN
connection.
b) When the PDN GW receives a PBU over PMIP-based S2a or S2b or S5/S8, the PDN
GW shall select one of the PDN connections for this APN and continue with the
handover procedure for that PDN connection. The PDN GW shall terminate the
remaining PDN connections for that APN without removing the PDN GW information
in HSS. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the
deactivated PDN connections using the PCEF initiated IP-CAN session
termination procedure as described in TS 23.203 [19].
c) Whenever the PDN GW receives a PBU containing an IPv6 prefix or an IPv4
address associated to one of the PDN connections and the IPv6 prefix or the
IPv4 address is valid, the PDN GW shall use the IPv6 prefix or the IPv4
address to select the PDN connection out of the active PDN connections. When
the information is not included in the PBU, the PDN GW and PCRF shall select
the latest PDN connection out of the active PDN connections for the given APN
(i.e. the PDN connection that was activated last out of the active PDN
connections for the given APN).
NOTE 1: The UE may disconnect from certain PDN connections while still in the
3GPP access to ensure that there is only one PDN connection per APN when
handing over to non-3GPP access.
\- If the UE hands over between 3GPP access and a non-3GPP access and the UE
has more than one PDN connection to a given APN in the source access and
multiple PDN connections to a single APN is supported in the target access the
following applies:
a) All PDN connections to the same APN shall be handed over.
b) When the PDN GW receives the request to establish a PDN connection to the
given APN, the PDN GW shall select one of the PDN connections for this APN and
continue with the handover procedure for that PDN connection.
c) When S2c is used and it is bootstrapped before the handover to a foreigner
link the home address identifies the PDN connection and the PDN GW shall
select the PDN connection accordingly.
NOTE 2: As all PDN connections to a single APN are moved during a handover,
the UE initiates the PDN connection re-establishment over the new access
network for all of the PDN connections to the given APN. Therefore there is no
need for the UE to indicate which of its PDN connections to the given APN is
moved with a particular PDN connection establishment request. The UE learns
which of its PDN connections is moved as a result of a PDN connection
establishment request from the assigned IPv6 prefix/IPv4 address.
NOTE 3: There is no relation between the values of the PDN connection
identities used over S2a/S2b and the EPS bearer identities used within 3GPP
networks. If GTP is used on S2b, there is no relation between the values of
the EPS bearer identities used within 3GPP networks and non-3GPP networks.
\- Upon handover from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access, if the MME has changed
since the last detach or if there is no valid Subscriber context for the UE in
the MME, or if the ME identity has changed, during the access authentication
the HSS returns the Subscriber Data to the MME, including the PDN GW identity
and the associated APN for each PDN the UE is connected to before the
handover. The UE performs an attach to the 3GPP access with and indication for
\"handover\" and then establishes connectivity with the remainder of PDNs that
it was connected with over the non-3GPP system before the handover, using UE
requested PDN connectivity specified in TS 23.401 [4]. The UE provides an
indication of \"handover\" by providing Request Type indicating \"handover\"
in the PDN connectivity request message as specified in TS 23.401 [4].
\- For connectivity based on S2c:
\- Upon handover from 3GPP access to non-3GPP access, and from non-3GPP access
to another non-3GPP access, the UE performs DSMIPv6 bootstrapping (if not yet
performed) and binding procedures for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from the source to the target access.
\- Upon handover from non-3GPP access, the UE de-registers the DSMIPv6 binding
for each PDN connection that is being transferred from the source to the
target access.
## 8.2 Handovers between non-3GPP IP access with PMIPv6 on S2a/S2b and 3GPP
Access
### 8.2.1 Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with PMIPv6 on
S2a/S2b to 3GPP Access
#### 8.2.1.1 General Procedure for GTP based S5/S8 for E-UTRAN Access
The steps involved in the handover from a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP IP
access to E-UTRAN connected to EPC are depicted below for both the non-roaming
and roaming cases and when PMIPv6 is used on S2a or S2b. It is assumed that
while the UE is served by the trusted or untrusted non-3GPP IP access, a
PMIPv6 tunnel is established between the non-3GPP access network and the PDN
GW in the EPC.
Figure 8.2.1.1-1: Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to
E-UTRAN with PMIPv6 on S2a or S2b and GTP on S5/S8 interfaces
NOTE 1: All steps outside of (A) and (B) are common for architecture variants
with GTP-based S5/S8 and PMIP-based S5/S8. Procedure steps (A) and (B) for
PMIP-based S5/S8 are described in clause 8.2.1.2.
NOTE 2: All steps inside of (C) are common for architecture variants with GTP-
based S2b and PMIP-based S2b. Procedure for steps outside of (C) for GTP-based
S2b are described in clause 8.6.1.1.
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 shall
be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 17 for each PDN connection that
is being transferred from non-3GPP access.
\- If the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 shall be performed. In
step 3 the UE should provide the APN corresponding to one of the PDN
connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP access. If the APN is not
provided, and the subscription context from HSS contains a PDN GW identity
corresponding to the default APN, the MME shall use the PDN GW corresponding
to the default APN as specified in TS 23.401 [4]. The UE shall then repeat
step 17 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred
from non-3GPP access.
\- Step 18 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred
from non-3GPP access.
The steps in 17 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to
the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
Both the roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1) scenarios
are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case, the vPCRF acts as an
intermediary, sending the QoS Policy Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the
HPLMN to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment
from the Serving GW and forwards it to the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all.
The steps involved in the handover are discussed below.
1) The UE uses a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access system and is being
served by PDN GW (as PMIPv6 LMA).
2) The UE discovers the E-UTRAN access and determines to transfer its current
sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used non-3GPP access system to
E-UTRAN. The mechanisms that aid the UE to discover the 3GPP Access system,
are specified in clause 4.8 (Network Discovery and Selection).
3) The UE sends an Attach Request to the MME with Request Type indicating
\"Handover\" Attach. The message from the UE is routed by E-UTRAN to the MME
as specified in TS 23.401 [4] (E-UTRAN). The UE should include any one of the
APNs, corresponding to the PDN connections in the source non-3GPP access. The
APN is provided as specified in TS 23.401 [4].
4) The MME may contact the HSS and authenticate the UE as described in TS
23.401 [4].
5) After successful authentication, the MME may perform location update
procedure and subscriber data retrieval from the HSS as specified in TS 23.401
[4]. Since theRequest Type is \"Handover\", the PDN GW identity conveyed to
the MME will be stored in PDN subscription context. The MME receives
information on the PDNs the UE is connected to over the non-3GPP access in the
Subscriber Data obtained from the HSS.
6) The MME selects an APN, a serving GW and PDN GW as described in TS 23.401
[4]. The MME sends a Create Session Request (including IMSI, MME Context ID
(SGSN equivalent is TBD), PDN-GW address, Handover Indication, APN) message to
the selected Serving GW. Since the Request Type is \"Handover\", a Handover
Indication information is included.
7) The Serving GW sends a Create Session Request (Handover Indication) message
to the PDN-GW in the VPLMN or HPLMN as described in TS 23.401 [4]. Since the
MME includes Handover Indication information in Create Session Request
message, the Serving GW includes this information in Create Session Request
message.
Since Handover Indication is included, the PDN GW should not switch the tunnel
from non-3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system at this point.
8) Since Handover Indication is included, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated
IP CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203
[19] to obtain the rules required for the PDN GW in the VPLMN or HPLMN to
function as the PCEF for all the active sessions the UE has established with
the new IP-CAN type as a result of the handover procedure. If the UE had
disconnected from the default PDN before handover then the PDN GW executes a
PCEF initiated IP CAN Session Establishment procedures as described in TS
23.203 [19].
If the updated PCC rules require establishment of dedicated bearer for the UE,
the establishment of those bearers take place before step 12. The
establishment of dedicated bearers in combination with the default takes place
as described in Annex F of TS 23.401 [4].
Since Handover Indication is included in step 7, the PDN GW stores the new PCC
Rules for E-UTRAN access as well as the old PCC Rules for the Trusted or
Untrusted Non-3GPP IP access and still applies the old PCC Rules for charging.
NOTE 3: PDN GW address and Serving GW address selection is as described in the
clause \"GW selection\" in TS 23.401 [4].
9) The PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response message to the Serving
GW as described in TS 23.401 [4].The Create Session Response contains the IP
address or the prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to
the non-3GPP IP access. It also contains the Charging Id previously assigned
to the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access although the Charging Id still
applies to the non-3GPP access.
10) The Serving GW returns a Create Session Response message to the MME as
specified in TS 23.401 [4]. This message also includes the IP address of the
UE. This message also serves as an indication to the MME that the S5 bearer
setup and update has been successful. At this step the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel(s)
over S5 are established.
11) Radio and Access bearers are established at this step in the 3GPP access
as specified in TS 23.401 [4].
12) The MME sends a Modify Bearer Request (eNodeB address, eNodeB TEID,
Handover Indication) message to the Serving GW.
13) Since the Handover Indication is included in step 12), the Serving GW
sends a Modify Bearer Request message to the PDN GW to prompt the PDN GW to
tunnel packets from non 3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system and immediately
start routing packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS
bearers established.
In this step, The PDN GW removes the old PCC Rules for the Trusted or
Untrusted Non-3GPP IP access and applies the new Rules for E-UTRAN access for
charging. The Charging Id previously in use for the PDN connection in the
non-3GPP access now only applies to the default bearer in use in E-UTRAN
access. If dedicated bearers are created, a new Charging Id is assigned by the
PGW for each of them according to TS 23.401 [4].
NOTE 4: Steps 13 and 14 are not performed if the PDNs are reconnected after
handoff by the UE in step 17.
14) The PDN GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response to the Serving
GW.
15) The Serving GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response (EPS Bearer
Identity) message to the MME.
16) The UE sends and receives data at this point via the E-UTRAN system.
17) For connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each
PDN that is being transferred from non-3GPP access, besides the PDN connection
established in steps 3-15, by executing the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure specified in TS 23.401 [4].
18) The PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in
the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12 or clause
7.9.
#### 8.2.1.2 Using PMIP-based S5/S8
When a Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to 3GPP Access handover occurs,
the following steps are performed instead of and in addition to the steps
performed in the GTP-based S5/S8 case (see previous clause). In the case of
PMIP-based S5/S8, a Create Session Request and Modify Bearer Request is not
sent from the Serving GW to the PDN GW. Rather, the serving GW interacts with
the hPCRF and PMIP messages are exchanged between the Serving GW and the PDN
GW.
Figure 8.2.1.2-1: Trusted/Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN Handover
over PMIP-based S2a and using PMIP-based S5/S8
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of
Figure 8.2.1.1-1 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 18 of
Figure 8.2.1.2-1 for each PDN connection that is being transferred from
non-3GPP access.
\- If the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1
shall be performed. In step 3 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 the UE shall provide the APN
corresponding to one of the PDN connections that are being transferred from
non-3GPP access. The UE shall then repeat step 18 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 for each
of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP
access.
\- Step 19 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that
is being transferred from non-3GPP access.
The steps in 18 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other
impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.
This procedure supports the home routed (Figure 4.2.2.1), roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The Serving GW establishes
a Gateway Control Session with the PCRF in the HPLMN. In the case of the
roaming or local breakout scenario, the Serving GW interacts with the hPCRF by
way of the vPCRF. The signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
In the case of Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with
the vPCRF. The vPCRF then exchanges messages with the hPCRF in the HPLMN.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in Figure
8.2.1.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
The steps shown in (Alt A) and (Alt B) are mutually exclusive in this
procedure, i.e. either steps A.2‑A.5 are executed or steps B.1‑B.3. In order
to execute the alternative (Alt B), the IP Address(es) of the UE needs to be
available after step A.1. The IP Address(es) of the UE is received in step
A.1, if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. If multiple PDN connections
to same APN are supported by the Serving GW, (Alt A) shall be used in this
procedure.
In case the IP address(es) of the UE is available after step A1, (Alt B)
provides lower jitter for dual radio handovers. In case the IP address(es) of
the UE is not available after step A1, (Alt A) shall be used.
A.1) The Serving GW initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules
required for the Serving GW to perform the bearer binding for all the active
sessions the UE may establish as a result of the handover procedure.
If the updated QoS rules require establishment of dedicated bearer for the UE,
the establishment of those bearers take place before step B1. The
establishment of dedicated bearers in combination with the default takes place
as described in Annex F of TS 23.401 [4].
A.2) The Serving GW sends a PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI, Lifetime,
Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, IP Address Requested, APN, GRE Key
for downlink traffic, Additional Parameters) message to the PDN GW. The MN NAI
identifies the UE. The Lifetime field must be set to a non-zero value in the
case of a registration. Access Technology Type is set to indicate 3GPP access
to EPS. The Serving GW includes request for IPv4 Home Address and/or IPv6 Home
Network Prefix as specified in step C.2 of clause 5.2. The APN may be
necessary to differentiate the intended PDN from the other PDNs supported by
the same PDN GW. The Serving GW includes the EPS bearer identity of the
default bearer received from the MME if multiple PDN connections to the same
APN are supported. The optional Additional Parameters may contain information,
for example, protocol configuration options.
A.3) The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules
required for the PDN GW to function as the PCEF for all the active IP sessions
the UE has established with new IP-CAN type.
A.4) The PDN GW responds with a Proxy Binding Ack (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE
Address Info, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters)
message to the Serving GW. The MN NAI is identical to the MN NAI sent in the
Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration the binding will
remain valid. The UE address info returns the IP Address assigned to the UE.
IP address allocation by the PDN-GW is as specified in clause 4.7.1. If the
PDN GW sends the DHCPv4 Address Allocation Procedure Indication in the Proxy
Binding Acknowledgement message, the UE IPv4 address assigned by the PDN GW is
not provided as part of the default bearer activation procedures to the UE. In
this case, the Serving GW does not forward the IPv4 address assigned by the
PDN GW to the MME, but sets the PDN Address to 0.0.0.0 in the message to the
MME. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains the EPS bearer
identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if multiple PDN connections to the
given APN are supported. The optional Additional Parameter information element
may contain other information, including for example Protocol Configuration
Options. The Serving GW acts as the MAG (in terms of PMIPv6). Since this step
is triggered by the Proxy Binding Update message from the Serving GW in step
A.2, it can occur after step A.2 and does not need to wait for step A.3.
The Charging Id provided by the PGW is the Charging Id previously assigned to
the PDN connection for the non-3GPP access.
NOTE 1: PDN GW address selection is as described in TS 23.401 [4].
NOTE 2: The Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports
multiple PDN connection to the same APN or not.
Steps between A and B.1 are described in clause 8.2.1.1.
B.1-B.3) Corresponds to steps A.2 - A.4, respectively.
Steps between B.1 and 18 are described in clause 8.2.1.1.
18) For connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each
PDN that is being transferred from non-3GPP access, besides the PDN connection
established in the steps above, by executing the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure specified in clause 5.6.1.
19) The PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in
the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12 or clause
7.9.
#### 8.2.1.3 General Procedure for GTP-based S5/S8 for UTRAN/GERAN
The steps involved in the handover from a trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access
to UTRAN/GERAN connected to EPC are depicted below for both the non-roaming
and roaming cases and when PMIPv6 is used on S2a or S2b. It is assumed that
while the UE is served by the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access, a PMIPv6
tunnel is established between the non-3GPP access network and the PDN GW in
the EPC.
NOTE 1: This procedure is applicable to S4-SGSN only.
Figure 8.2.1.3-1: Handover from Trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to
UTRAN/GERAN with PMIP on S2a and GTP based S5/S8
NOTE 2: All steps outside of (A) and (B) are common for architecture variants
with GTP based S5/S8 and PMIP based S5/S8. Procedure steps (A) and (B) for
PMIP based S5/S8 are described in clause 8.2.1.4.
NOTE 3: All steps in (D) are common for architecture variants with GTP based
S2b and PMIP based S2b. Procedures for steps outside of (D) for GTP based S2b
are described in clause 8.6.1.2.
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 6 shall be
skipped.
\- If the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 6 shall be performed.
\- The steps in (C) shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from non-3GPP access.
The steps in (C) can occur in parallel for each PDN.
The steps involved in the handover are described below.
1\. The UE uses a trusted/untrusted non-3GPP access system and is being served
by PDN GW (as PMIPv6 LMA).
2\. The UE discovers the 3GPP Access system (UTRAN or GERAN) and determines to
transfer its current sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used non-3GPP
access system to the discovered 3GPP Access system. The mechanisms that aid
the UE to discover the 3GPP Access system, are specified in clause 4.8
(Network Discovery and Selection).
3\. The UE sends an Attach Request to the SGSN. The message from the UE is
routed by 3GPP Access to the SGSN as specified in clause 6.5 of TS 23.060
[21].
4\. The SGSN may contact the HSS and authenticate the UE as described in TS
23.060 [21].
5\. The SGSN may perform location update procedure and subscriber data
retrieval from the HSS as specified in TS 23.060 [21]. PDN GW identity
information is part of the subscriber data..
6\. The SGSN sends the Attach Accept request to the UE to indicate the
completion of the attach procedure as defined in TS 23.060 [21].
7\. The UE initiate at this stage this establishment of the primary PDP
context as defined in clause 9.2.2 of TS 23.060 [21].
8\. The SGSN selects a Serving GW as described in TS 23.060 [21] and sends
Create Session Request (Handover indication, and other parameters described in
TS 23.060 [21]) message to the selected Serving GW.
9\. The Serving GW sends a Create Session Request message to the PDN-GW as
described in TS 23.060 [21]. The PDN GW should not switch the tunnel from
non-3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system at this point.
10\. The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules
required for the PDN GW to function as the PCEF for all the active sessions
the UE has established with the new IP-CAN type as a result of the handover
procedure.
If the updated PCC rules require establishment of dedicated EPS bearers for
the UE, the establishment of those bearers take place before step 12. The
Dedicated bearer shall be mapped to Secondary PDP contexts by the Serving
Gateway. The default and dedicated bearers are synchronised as described in
Annex F of TS 23.401 [4].
Since the PDN GW does not switch the tunnel in step 9, it stores the new PCC
Rules for UTRAN/GERAN access as well as the old PCC Rules for the Trusted or
Untrusted Non-3GPP IP access and still applies the old PCC Rules for charging.
NOTE 4: PDN GW address and Serving GW address selection is as described in the
clause \"GW selection\" in TS 23.401 [4].
11\. The PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response message to the Serving
GW as described in TS 23.060 [21].The Create Session Response contains the IP
address or the prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was connected to
the non-3GPP IP access. It also contains the Charging Id previously assigned
to the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access although the Charging Id still
applies to the non-3GPP access.
12\. The Serving GW returns a Create Session Response message to the SGSN as
specified in TS 23.060 [21]. This message also includes the IP address of the
UE. This message also serves as an indication to the SGSN that the S5 bearer
setup and update has been successful.
13\. The rest of the PDP context establishment as specified in TS 23.060 [21]
is completed here.
14.The Serving GW sends a Modify Bearer Request message to the PDN GW in the
VPLMN or the HPLMN including the Handover Indication flag that prompts the PDN
GW to tunnel packets from non 3GPP IP access to 3GPP access system and
immediately start routing packets to the Serving GW for the default and any
dedicated EPS bearers established. In case of non-roaming or roaming with home
routed traffic this message is sent to the PDN GW in the HPLMN. In case of
local breakout traffic the message is sent to the PDN GW in the VPLMN.
In this step, The PDN GW removes the old PCC Rules for the Trusted or
Untrusted Non-3GPP IP access and applies the new Rules for UTRAN/GERAN access
for charging. The Charging Id previously in use for the PDN connection in the
non-3GPP access now only applies to the default bearer in use in GERAN/UTRAN
access. If dedicated bearers are created, a new Charging Id is assigned by the
PGW for each of them according to TS 23.401 [4].
15\. The PDN GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response to the Serving
GW.
16\. The UE sends and receives data at this point via the 3GPP access system.
17\. The PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in
the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12 or clause
7.9.
#### 8.2.1.4 Using PMIP-based S5/S8
When a Trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to UTRAN/GERAN handover occurs,
the following steps are performed instead of and in addition to the steps
performed in the GTP based S5/S8 case (see previous clause). In the case of
PMIP based S5/S8, a Create Session Request and Modify Bearer Request is not
sent from the Serving GW to the PDN GW. Rather, the serving GW interacts with
the hPCRF and PMIP messages are exchanged between the Serving GW and the PDN
GW.
Figure 8.2.1.4-1: Trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to GERAN/UTRAN over
PMIP-based S2a and using PMIP-based S5/S8
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, the procedure as per
Figure 8.2.1.3-1 before step 7 shall be skipped.
\- If the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, the procedure as per Figure 8.2.1.3-1
before step 7 shall be performed.
\- The steps in (C) shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from non-3GPP access.
The steps in (C) can occur in parallel for each PDN.
This procedure supports the home routed (Figure 4.2.2-1), roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The Serving GW establishes
a Gateway Control Session with the PCRF in the HPLMN. In the case of the
roaming or local breakout scenario, the Serving GW interacts with the hPCRF by
way of the vPCRF. The signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
In the case of Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with
the vPCRF. The vPCRF then exchanges messages with the hPCRF in the HPLMN.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in Figure
8.2.1.4-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
The steps shown in (Alt A) and (Alt B) are mutually exclusive in this
procedure, i.e. either steps A.2-A.5 are executed or steps B.1‑B.3. In order
to execute the alternative (Alt B), the IP Address(es) of the UE needs to be
available after step A.1. The IP Address(es) of the UE is received in step
A.1, if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. If multiple PDN connections
to same APN are supported by the Serving GW, (Alt A) shall be used in this
procedure.
In case the IP address(es) of the UE is available after step A1, (Alt B)
provides lower jitter for dual radio handovers. In case the IP address(es) of
the UE is not available after step A1, (Alt A) shall be used.
A.1) The Serving GW initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules
required for the Serving GW to perform the bearer binding for all the active
sessions the UE may establish as a result of the handover procedure.
If the updated PCC rules require establishment of dedicated bearer for the UE,
the establishment of those bearers take place before step B.1.
The description of steps A.1 to A.4 and B.1 to B.3 are the same as in clause
8.2.1.2.
### 8.2.2 3GPP Access to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access Handover with PMIPv6 on
S2a
The steps involved in the handover from 3GPP Access connected to the EPC to
trusted non-3GPP IP access are depicted below for the case of non-roaming,
roaming with home routed traffic, roaming with local breakout and roaming with
anchoring in the Serving Gateway in the VPLMN. It is assumed that while the UE
is served by the 3GPP Access, a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established between
the S‑GW and the PDN GW in the evolved packet core.
Figure 8.2.2-1: Handover from 3GPP Access to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with
PMIPv6 on S2a and PMIPv6 or GTP on S5 interface
This procedure supports the home routed (Figure 4.2.2.1), roaming (Figure
4.2.3-1) and Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The PCRF in the HPLMN is
informed of the change and any change in the policy that results is signalled
to the Serving GW. The signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
In the case of Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with
the vPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in Figure
8.2.2-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
For connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2
to 10 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 11 for each PDN
connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.
\- If the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 10 shall be
performed. In step 4 the UE shall provide an APN corresponding to one of the
PDN connections that are being transferred from 3GPP access. The UE shall then
repeat step 11 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being
transferred from 3GPP access.
\- Step 12 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred
from 3GPP access.
Step 11 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the
handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.
1) The UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on
the S5 interface.
2) The UE discovers the trusted non-3GPP IP access system and determines to
transfer its current sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used 3GPP
Access to the discovered trusted non-3GPP IP access system. The mechanisms
that aid the UE to discover the trusted non-3GPP IP access system, are
specified in clause 4.8 (Network Discovery and Selection).
3) The UE performs access authentication and authorization in the non-3GPP
access system. The 3GPP AAA server authenticates and authorizes the UE for
access in the trusted non-3GPP system. The 3GPP AAA server queries the HSS and
returns the PDN-GW identity or identities to the trusted non-3GPP access
system at this step (upon successful authentication and authorization). The
3GPP AAA Server also returns to the trusted non-3GPP access system the MN NAI
to be used to identify the UE in Proxy Binding Update and Gateway Control
Session Establishment messages (steps 5 and 6).
PDN GW address selection is as described in clause 4.5.1 of this
specification. The PDNs the UE is connected to before handover are obtained
from the HSS with the UE subscriber data.
NOTE 1: The MN NAI returned from the 3GPP AAA Server to the trusted non-3GPP
access system is a permanent IMSI based MN NAI.
4) After successful authentication and authorization, the L3 attach procedure
is triggered. At the latest, in this step, the UE should indicate its
capability for the IP address preservation. How this information is signalled
from the UE to the access network is outside of the scope of 3GPP.
If the UE provides an APN, the Trusted non-3GPP Access verifies that it is
allowed by subscription. If the UE does not provide an APN, and the
subscription context from HSS contains a PDN GW identity and APN pair
corresponding to the default APN, the Trusted non-3GPP Access uses the default
APN. The case where the APN selected for the handover attach (default APN or
the APN provided by the UE) does not have corresponding PDN GW identity
information in the subscription context is considered as an error case.
5) The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access initiates a Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. If the
Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access supports UE/NW bearer control mode, the PCRF
provides all the QoS rules required for the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access to
perform the bearer binding.
If the updated rules require network-initiated dynamic resource allocation for
the UE, the resource allocation takes place before step 6.
If the Handover Indicator in the Proxy Binding Update (to be sent in step 6)
is set to indicate either initial attach or that the handover state is
unknown, the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access indicates in the Gateway Control
Session Establishment message that linking with the Gx session shall be
deferred until step 7, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, when
performing the leg linking, the PCRF verifies that the IP-CAN type reported
over Gxa and Gx are the same.
6) The entity in the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access acting as a MAG sends a Proxy
Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator,
APN, GRE key for downlink traffic) message to the PDN GW in order to establish
the new registration. The MN NAI identifies the UE for whom the message is
being sent. The Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value in the case of a
registration. Access Technology Type is set to a value matching the
characteristics of the non-3GPP access. The APN may be necessary to
differentiate the intended PDN from the other PDNs supported by the same PDN
GW. The MAG creates and includes a PDN connection identity if the MAG supports
multiple PDN connections to a single APN.
NOTE 2: When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported, the MN-
ID, the APN and the PDN connection identity indentify the PDN connection
within the Trusted Non-3GPP access network.
7A) The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification Procedure
with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The Event Report indicates the
change in Access Type.
If the PDN GW decided to allocate a new IP address/prefix instead of
preserving the old IP address/prefix, as described in clause 4.1.3.2.3, the
PDN GW executes an IP-CAN session Establishment Procedure with the PCRF
instead of a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure.
7B) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection and obtains authorization
information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may
update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
8) The PDN GW responds with a PMIP Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime,
UE Address Info, Additional Parameters, GRE key for uplink traffic, Charging
ID) message to the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access. The MN NAI is identical to the
MN NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime indicates the duration
the binding will remain valid. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update
contains a PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if the PDN GW
supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. The UE address info returns
the IP Address assigned to the UE. The optional Additional Parameter
information element may contain other information. Since this step is
triggered by the Proxy Binding Update message from the Trusted non-3GPP IP
Access in step 6 and the result of the optional step 7, it can occur after
step 7. If step 7 is not taken, this step can occur after step 6. The Charging
Id provided is the Charging Id previously assigned to the PDN connection if
the source access is a PMIP-based access or to the Default Bearer if the
source access is GTP-based.
NOTE 3: The MAG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN
connection to the same APN or not.
9) L3 attach procedure is completed at this point. The IP address(es) assigned
to the UE by the PDN-GW is conveyed to the UE.
10) The PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the
PDN GW. The UE can send/receive IP packets at this point.
11) For connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to all
the PDNs that are being transferred from 3GPP access besides the PDN
connection that was established in the steps 3-10, as described in clause
6.8.1.
12) The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure
in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer
Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.
### 8.2.3 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access Handover with PMIPv6 on
S2b
This clause shows a call flow for a handover when a UE moves from a 3GPP
Access to an untrusted non-3GPP access network. PMIPv6/GTP is assumed to be
used on the S5/S8 interface and PMIPv6 is used on the S2b interface.
Figure 8.2.3-1: Handover from 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with
PMIPv6 on S2b
NOTE 1: For GTP based S2b, procedure steps (A) to (D) are defined in clause
8.6.2.1.
Both the roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1) scenarios
are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case, the vPCRF acts as an
intermediary, sending the QoS Policy Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the
HPLMN to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment
from the Serving GW and forwards it to the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved.
For connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2
to 9 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 10 for each PDN
connection that is being transferred from 3GPP access.
\- If the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 9 shall be
performed. In step 3 the UE shall provide an APN corresponding to one of the
PDN connections that are being transferred from 3GPP access. The UE shall then
repeat step 10 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being
transferred from 3GPP access.
\- Step 11 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred
from 3GPP access.
Step 10 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the
handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured in the gateway.
1) The UE is initially attached to the 3GPP Access network.
2) The UE moves and attaches to an untrusted non-3GPP IP access network.
3) Access authentication procedure between UE and the 3GPP EPC may be
performed as defined by TS 33.402 [45].
4) The IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE. The ePDG IP
address to which the UE needs to form IPsec tunnel with is discovered as
specified in clause 4.5.4. After the UE is authenticated, UE is also
authorized for access to the APN. The procedure is as described in TS 33.234
[7]. As part of access authentication the PDN GW identity is sent to the ePDG
by the 3GPP AAA server. If the UE supports IP address preservation during
handover from 3GPP Access to the untrusted non-3GPP IP access, the UE shall
include its address (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix /address or both) allocated
when it\'s attached to 3GPP Access into the CFG_Request sent to the ePDG
during IKEv2 message exchange.
5) The ePDG sends the Proxy Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access
Technology Type, Handover Indicator, GRE key for downlink traffic, UE Address
Info, Additional Parameter) message to the PDN GW. Access Technology Type is
set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP access. The UE
Address Info shall be set according to the CFG_Request in step 3. The ePDG
shall not change the requested address(es) in the CFG_Request sent by the UE,
and encode such address(es) in PBU and send to the PDN GW. If the UE included
the address in step 3, the ePDG sets the handover indicator to indicate
Handoff between two different interfaces of the UE. The APN is used by the PDN
GW to determine which PDN to establish connectivity for, in the case that the
PDN GW supports multiple PDN connectivity. The ePDG creates and includes a PDN
connection identity if the ePDG supports multiple PDN connections to a single
APN.
NOTE 2: When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported, the MN-
ID, the APN and the PDN connection identity indentify the PDN connection
within the Untrusted Non-3GPP access network.
6A) If PCC is supported, the PDN GW requires configuration for enforcing
policy, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
6B) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection and obtains authorization
information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may
update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
7) The PDN GW processes the Proxy Binding Update message from the ePDG,
updates the binding cache entry for the UE and responds with a Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement (MN_NAI, Lifetime, GRE key for uplink traffic, UE Address
Info, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message. In the Proxy Binding Ack,
the PDN GW replies with the same IP address and/or prefix that was assigned to
the UE earlier. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update contains a PDN
connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if the PDN GW supports
multiple PDN connections to a single APN. At this point a PMIPv6 tunnel exists
between PDN GW and ePDG. Since this step is triggered by the Proxy Binding
Update message from the ePDG in step 4, it can occur after step 4 and does not
need to wait for step 5. The Charging Id provided is the Charging Id
previously assigned to the PDN connection if the source access is a PMIP-based
access or to the Default Bearer if the source access is GTP-based.
NOTE 3: The ePDG learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports multiple PDN
connection to the same APN or not.
8) The ePDG and the UE continue the IKEv2 exchange and IP address
configuration.
9) At the end of the handover procedure there is a default bearer for the UE
that consists of an IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG and a PMIPv6
tunnel between the ePDG and the PDN GW.
10) For connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each
PDN that is being transferred from 3GPP access, besides the PDN connection
that was established in the steps 3-8, by executing the UE-initiated
Connectivity to Additional PDN procedure specified in clause 7.6.1.
11) The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure
in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer
Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.

### 8.2.6 Non-3GPP IP Access to 3GPP Access Handover with PMIPv6 on S2a/b for
Chained PMIP-based S8
The steps involved in the handover from a trusted or non-trusted non-3GPP IP
access to a 3GPP access connected to EPC are depicted below for roaming cases
with chained S2a/b and PMIP-based S8. It is assumed that while the UE is
served by the non-3GPP IP access, a PMIPv6 tunnel is established between the
non-3GPP access network and the Serving GW and another one between the Serving
GW and the PDN GW.
Figure 8.2.6-1: Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to 3GPP
Access with chained S2a/b and PMIP-based S8
In case of handover to E-UTRAN, the following applies for connectivity to
multiple PDNs:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, the procedure as per
Figure 8.2.1.2-1 before step 18 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform
step 18 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 for each PDN connection that is being transferred
from non-3GPP access.
\- If the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, the procedure as per Figure 8.2.1.2-1
before step 18 shall be performed. In step 3 of Figure 8.2.1.2-1 the UE shall
provide an APN corresponding to one of the PDN connections that are being
transferred from non-3GPP access. The UE shall then repeat step 18 of Figure
8.2.1.2-1 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred
from 3GPP access.
In case of handover to UTRAN/GERAN, the following applies for connectivity to
multiple PDNs:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 6 of
Figure 8.2.1.4-1 shall be skipped.
\- If the UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 6 of Figure 8.2.1.4-1
shall be performed.
\- The UE shall repeat steps 7 to 16 of Figure 8.2.1.4-1 for each PDN
connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.
For connectivity to multiple PDNs step 3 of Figure 8.2.6-1 shall be repeated
for each PDN connection that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.
NOTE: The procedure applies both for the case where a new Serving GW is
selected during attach on 3GPP access or for the case where the Serving GW is
not changed.
1) The UE uses a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access system. PDN connectivity
is achieved through concatenated PMIPv6 tunnels between the trusted non-3GPP
access or ePDG and the Serving GW, and between the Serving GW and the PDN GW.
2) The handover procedure from trusted or untrusted non-3GPP IP access with
PMIPv6 on S2a/S2b to 3GPP access with PMIP-based S5/S8 is performed as
described in steps 2‑18 of clause 8.2.1.2 (for E‑UTRAN) and steps 2‑16 of
clause 8.2.1.4 (for UTRAN/GERAN).
3) In case a new Serving GW has been selected during the attach on 3GPP
access, the PDN GW triggers the bearer release in the non-3GPP access as
defined in clause 6.12.3. Otherwise, the Serving GW triggers resource release
in the non-3GPP access as defined in steps 2‑5 of clause 6.12.3.
### 8.2.7 3GPP Access to Non-3GPP IP Access Handover with PMIPv6 on S2a/b for
Chained PMIP-based S8
The steps involved in the handover from a 3GPP access to a trusted or non-
trusted non-3GPP IP access connected to EPC are depicted below for roaming
cases with chained S2a/b and PMIP-based S8.
Figure 8.2.7-1: Handover from 3GPP IP Access to Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP
Access with chained S2a/b and PMIP-based S8
For connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 11
shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 12 for each PDN connection
that is being transferred from 3GPP access.
\- If the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 11 shall be performed.
In step 3 the UE shall provide an APN corresponding to one of the PDN
connections that are being transferred from 3GPP access. The UE shall then
repeat step 12 for each of the remaining PDN connections that are being
transferred from 3GPP access.
\- Step 13 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being transferred
from 3GPP access.
Step 12 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to the
handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.
Steps 3 and 4 do not apply in case of handover from a 3GPP access to an
untrusted non-3GPP access.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in Figure
8.2.7-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
NOTE 1: The procedure applies both for the case where a new Serving GW is
selected during attach on 3GPP access, or for the case where the Serving GW is
not changed.
1) The UE is connected to the PDN via a 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 tunnel on
the S8 interface.
2) The attach initiation on the trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access is
performed as described in steps 2‑3 of clause 8.2.2 (for trusted non-3GPP
access) and steps 2‑3 of clause 8.2.3 (for untrusted non-3GPP access). As part
of the authentication procedure, the 3GPP AAA proxy obtains the PDN-GW
identity from the HSS/AAA as described in clause 4.5.1, and performs Serving
GW selection as described in clause 4.5.3. Both PDN GW identity and Serving GW
information is provided to the MAG function of the trusted non-3GPP access or
ePDG. If PCC is deployed, the MAG function of the Trusted Non-3GPP IP access
is notified to interact with the PCRF when it is the PMIP-based chained case.
3) After successful authentication and authorization, the L3 attach procedure
in the trusted non-3GPP access is triggered as described in step 4 of clause
8.2.2.
4) The trusted non-3GPP access initiates a Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as described in step 5 of clause 8.2.2.
5) The MAG function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or ePDG sends a Proxy
Binding Update (MN-NAI, Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator,
APN, GRE key for downlink traffic, PDN GW address, Additional Parameters)
message to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The MN NAI identifies the UE. The
Lifetime field must be set to a nonzero value, indicating registration. Access
Technology Type is set to a value matching the characteristics of the non-3GPP
access. Handover Indicator is set to indicate handoff between two different
interfaces of the UE. The MAG creates and includes a PDN connection identity
if the MAG supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. The Additional
Parameters may include Protocol Configuration Options and other information.
NOTE 2: When multiple PDN connections to a single APN are supported, the MN-
ID, the APN and the PDN connection identity indentify the PDN connection
within the Trusted Non-3GPP access network.
6) The Serving GW sends a corresponding Proxy Binding Update (MN‑NAI,
Lifetime, Access Technology Type, Handover Indicator, APN, GRE key for
downlink traffic, Additional Parameters) message (as in step 3) to the PDN GW.
If the MAG included the PDN connection identity in the Proxy Binding Update of
the previous step and the Serving GW supports multiple PDN connections to a
single APN then the Serving GW forwards the PDN connection identity to the PDN
GW.
NOTE 3: In this Release of the specification, the Serving GW uses the right
protocol to connect with the PDN GW based on the pre-configured information on
itself in case the selected Serving GW supporting both PMIP and GTP.
7A) The PDN GW initiates the PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
Procedure with the hPCRF to update the rules in the PDN GW, as specified in TS
23.203 [19].
7B) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection and obtains authorization
information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may
update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
8) The PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and creates a binding cache
entry for the PMIPv6 tunnel towards the Serving GW. The PDN GW responds with a
Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN‑NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for
uplink traffic, Additional Parameters) message to the Serving GW. The MN‑NAI
is identical to the MN‑NAI sent in the Proxy Binding Update. The Lifetime
indicates the duration the binding will remain valid. The UE Address Info
includes one or more IP addresses. If the corresponding Proxy Binding Update
contains a PDN connection identity, the PDN GW shall acknowledge if the PDN GW
supports multiple PDN connections to a single APN. The Additional Parameters
may include Protocol Configuration Options and other information. The
Additional Parameters may include Protocol Configuration Options and other
information.
NOTE 4: The Serving GW learns from the PBA whether the PDN GW supports
multiple PDN connection to the same APN or not.
9) The Serving GW processes the proxy binding acknowledgement and creates a
binding cache entry for the PMIPv6 tunnel towards the MAG function in the
trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG. At this point, the Serving GW also
establishes the internal forwarding state for the concatenation of the PMIPv6
tunnels. The Serving GW then sends a corresponding Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info, GRE key for uplink
traffic, Charging ID, Additional Parameters) message (as in step 8) to the MAG
function of Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access or ePDG.
10) The handover attach procedure is completed as described in step 9 of
clause 8.2.2 (for trusted non-3GPP access) and steps 7‑8 of clause 8.2.3 (for
untrusted non-3GPP access).
11) The UE is connected to the PDN via the non-3GPP access system. PDN
connectivity is achieved through concatenated PMIPv6 tunnels between the
trusted non-3GPP access or ePDG and the Serving GW, and between the Serving GW
and the PDN GW.
12) For connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity to each
PDN that is being transferred from 3GPP access, besides the PDN connection
established in steps 2-11, by executing the UE-initiated Connectivity to
Additional PDN procedure specified in clause 6.8.1.2, that applies to both
trusted and untrusted non-3GPP accesses.
13) In case a new Serving GW has been selected during the attach on the
non-3GPP access, the PDN GW triggers the bearer release in the 3GPP access
using the PDN GW initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure. Otherwise, the
Serving GW triggers the bearer release in the 3GPP Access using the Serving GW
initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure. The 3GPP access resources associated
with the PDN address are released if existing.

## 8.3 Handover from 3GPP access to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with MIPv4
FACoA on S2a
Figure 8.3-1: 3GPP IP Access to Non-3GPP IP access Handover over MIPv4-based
S2a
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and trusted non-3GPP access
before the handover of PDN connections to trusted non-3GPP access is
triggered, steps 2 to 5 shall be skipped.
\- If the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 5 shall be
performed.
\- Steps 6 to 14 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from 3GPP access.
Step 6 to step 14 can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other impacts related to
the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.
The steps involved in the handover from 3GPP Access connected to the EPC to
trusted non-3GPP IP access are depicted below for the case of non-roaming,
roaming with home routed traffic, roaming with local breakout and roaming with
anchoring in the Serving Gateway in the VPLMN. It is assumed that while the UE
is served by the 3GPP Access, a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established between
the S‑GW and the PDN GW in the evolved packet core.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
Both the roaming (Figure 4.2.1-2) and non-roaming (Figure 4.2.1-1) scenarios
are depicted in the figure. In the roaming case, the vPCRF acts as an
intermediary, sending the QoS Policy Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the
HPLMN to the Serving GW in the VPLMN. The vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment
from the Serving GW and forwards it to the hPCRF. In the non-roaming case, the
vPCRF is not involved at all.
The event that triggers Authentication and Authorization in step 3 or step 6
between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server, or whether
this step occurs at all, depends on the specific access technology.
1) The UE is connected in the 3GPP Access and has a PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel on
the S5 interface.
2) The UE discovers the trusted non-3GPP IP access system and determines to
transfer its current sessions (i.e. handover) from the currently used 3GPP
Access to the discovered trusted non-3GPP IP access system. The mechanisms
that aid the UE to discover the trusted non-3GPP IP access system, are
specified in clause 4.8 (Network Discovery and Selection).
3) The UE performs access authentication and authorization in the non-3GPP
access system as defined by TS 33.402 [45]. The 3GPP AAA server authenticates
and authorizes the UE for access in the trusted non-3GPP system. As part of
the authentication and authorization procedure, the 3GPP AAA server obtains
the PDN-GW identity from the HSS and it returns the same PDN-GW identity to
the trusted non-3GPP access system at this step (upon successful
authentication and authorization).
4) The UE may send an Agent Solicitation (AS) RFC 5944 [12] message.
Specification of this message is out of the scope of 3GPP.
5) The FA in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Foreign Agent
Advertisement (FAA) (RFC 5944 [12]) message to the UE. The FAA message
includes the Care-of Address (CoA) of the Foreign Agent function in the FA.
Specification of this message is out of the scope of 3GPP.
6) The UE sends a Registration Request (RRQ) (MN-NAI, lifetime) message as
defined in RFC 5944 [12] to the FA as specified in RFC 5944 [12]. Reverse
Tunnelling shall be requested. This ensures that all traffic will go through
the PDN GW. The RRQ message shall include the NAI-Extension RFC 2794 [34]. The
UE may not indicate a specific Home Agent address in the RRQ message, in which
case the FA uses the PDN GW address as received in step 3. The UE then
receives the IP address of the PDN Gateway in step 11 as part of the RRP
message. The UE should then include the PDN Gateway address in the Home Agent
address field of subsequent RRQ messages.
7) The Trusted non‑3GPP access initiates the Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF. The Trusted non‑3GPP access provides
the information to the PCRF to correctly associate it with the IP‑CAN session
and also to convey subscription related parameters to the PCRF. If the Trusted
Non-3GPP access supports UE/NW bearer control mode, the PCRF provides all the
QoS rules required for the Trusted Non-3GPP access to perform the bearer
binding.
8) The FA processes the message according to RFC 5944 [12] and forwards a
corresponding RRQ (MN-NAI, lifetime) message to the PDN GW.
9) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection and obtains authentication and
authorization information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes
information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP
AAA Server may update the information registered in the HSS as described in
clause 12.
10) The PDN GW allocates an IP address for the UE. The PDN GW initiates the IP
CAN Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203
[19]. The PDN GW provides information to the PCRF that the IP-CAN type has
changed and the PCRF responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules and event triggers.
11) The PDN GW sends a Registration Reply (RRP) (MN-NAI, Home Address, Home
Agent Address) message as defined in RFC 5944 [12] to the FA.
12) The FA processes the RRP (MN-NAI, Home Address) according to RFC 5944 [12]
and sends a corresponding RRP message to the UE.
13) IP connectivity from the UE to the PDN GW is now setup. A MIP tunnel is
established between the FA in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW.
14) The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure
in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer
Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.
## 8.3b Handover from Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with MIPv4 FACoA on S2a to
3GPP access
In this scenario, the session starts in a trusted non-3GPP access system using
MIPv4 FA CoA and subsequently, the session hands over to a 3GPP access system.
The steps involved are shown in the figure below.
Figure 8.3b-1: Handover from Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with MIPv4 FACoA on
S2a to 3GPP Access
For connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of
Figure 8.2.1.1-1 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 17 of
Figure 8.2.1.1-1 for each PDN connection that is being transferred from
non-3GPP access.
\- If UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1
shall be performed. In step 3 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 the UE shall provide the APN
corresponding to one of the PDN connections that are being transferred from
non-3GPP access. The UE shall then repeat step 17 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 for each
of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP
access.
\- Steps 4 and 5 of Figure 8.3b-1 shall be repeated for each PDN connection
that is being transferred from non-3GPP access.
Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in
clause 8.1.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
1) The UE uses a trusted non-3GPP access system. It has a MIPv4 session with
the PDN GW with a FA in the trusted non-3GPP access using FACoA.
2) The UE discovers and attaches to the 3GPP access as defined in Step (C) of
Figure 8.2.1.1-1, except that the IP CAN session modification and the path
switch are triggered as explained below.
3) The UE may send an Agent Solicitation RFC 5944 [12] message. The HA
functionality in the PDN GW sends an Agent Advertisement (AA) RFC 5944 [12]
message to the UE.
4) The UE determines that it is back home through inspection of the H bit and
advertised prefix within the agent advertisement (AA) received in the previous
step. The UE sends a Registration Request message with the destination address
set to the HA\'s address and with a Lifetime field set to 0 to indicate
deregistration. Once the deregistration request is accepted, the UE receives
an Registration Response message from the HA.
5) The PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in the
trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12.
## 8.4 Handovers with DSMIPv6 on S2c
### 8.4.1 Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6 over S2c to
3GPP Access Handover
In this scenario, the session starts in a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access
system using DSMIPv6 and subsequently, the session hands over to a 3GPP access
system.
The steps involved in the handover from a trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access
to 3GPP Access connected to EPC are depicted below when DSMIPv6 is used on S2c
over non-3GPP system.
Figure 8.4.1-1: Trusted Non-3GPP S2c (DSMIPv6) to 3GPP with S5 handover
For connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of
Figure 8.2.1.1-1 shall be skipped and the UE shall only perform step 17 of
Figure 8.2.1.1-1 for each PDN connection that is being transferred from
non-3GPP access.
\- If UE is connected only to non-3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to 3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 16 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1
shall be performed. In step 3 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 the UE shall provide the APN
corresponding to one of the PDN connections that are being transferred from
non-3GPP access. The UE shall then repeat step 17 of Figure 8.2.1.1-1 for each
of the remaining PDN connections that are being transferred from non-3GPP
access.
\- Step 3 of Figure 8.4.1-1 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is
being transferred from non-3GPP access.
Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in
clause 8.1.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured with the gateway.
1) The UE uses a trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access system. It has a DSMIPv6
session with the PDN GW.
2) The UE discovers and attaches to the 3GPP access as defined in Step (C) of
Figure 8.2.1.1-1, except that the IP‑CAN session modification and the path
switch are triggered as explained below.
3) The UE sends a BU (lifetime) to the PDN GW to de-register its DSMIPv6
binding, as defined in RFC 5555 [10] that was created while the UE was in
non-3GPP access system. The UE shall inform the PDN GW that the whole home
prefix shall be moved. The PDN GW responds with a BA message as defined in RFC
5555 [10].
Any time after step 2, prior to receiving the de-registration Binding Update
from the UE (i.e. BU with lifetime = 0), which is received in (step 3), the
PDN GW may de-register the DSMIPv6 binding. In this case the PDN GW shall send
a Binding Revocation Indication message to the UE.
Following the de-registration of the DSMIPv6 binding due to reception of de-
registration Binding update or due to triggering Binding Revocation, the PDN
GW triggers PCEF initiated IP‑CAN session modification, instead of doing it as
part of the step 2, and performs path switch to forward downlink packets to
the UE without any tunnelling (as the UE is on the home link).
4) This step occurs only if all PDN connections have handed over to the 3GPP
access. The PCRF initiates \"PCRF-initiated Gateway Control Session
Termination\" procedure to release the resources in the non-3GPP access. This
procedure is triggered by the PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification
Procedure with the PCRF, occurring as a result of step 2.
According to RFC 4877 [22] the security associations between the UE and the
PDN GW(s) should not be immediately deleted. As the security associations were
created dynamically using IKEv2 they will be automatically deleted when they
expire. The IP address used by the UE as home address is not released by the
UE and the PDN GW as a result of the deletion of such security associations if
the UE remains connected to the PDN GW. This applies also to the scenario
where the UE performed the initial attach over a 3GPP access and was given a
IP address, bootstrapped the DSMIPv6 over the 3GPP access, performed an
handover to the non-3GPP access using S2c, and is now performing an handover
towards 3GPP access and therefore returning to the Home Link.
### 8.4.2 3GPP Access to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access Handover with DSMIPv6 over
S2c
In this scenario, the session starts in 3GPP access (e.g. E-UTRAN) using
PMIPv6 or GTP over S5 or no S5 is used (co-located Serving GW and PDN GW). The
session hands over to the trusted non-3GPP access system that does not use
PMIPv6 where the UE will receive a different prefix than the one it was using
in 3GPP access system. The UE subsequently initiates DSMIPv6 with the same PDN
GW to maintain the IP session.
Support of PCC for Trusted non-3GPP accesses is optional. The PCC interactions
shown in Figure 8.4.2-1 are omitted if the Trusted non-3GPP access does not
support PCC. If PCC is not supported, policy rules may be configured by other
means.
In the non-roaming case, none of the optional entities in Figure 8.4.2-1 are
involved.
The optional entities are involved in other cases.
\- In the roaming cases, however, the 3GPP AAA Proxy mediates all interaction
between the 3GPP AAA Server in the PLMN and entities in the VPLMN and non-3GPP
access.
\- Similarly, interaction between hPCRF in the HPLMN and entities in the VPLMN
and non-3GPP access occurs by way of the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In both these
cases, messages are relayed by the optional entities towards and from the
HPLMN.
Figure 8.4.2-1: 3GPP S5 to Trusted Non-3GPP S2c (DSMIPv6) Handover
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2
to 5 shall be skipped.
\- If the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to trusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 5 shall be
performed.
\- Steps 7 to 12 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from 3GPP access. If not performed in 3GPP access prior to the
handover, Step 6 shall also be repeated for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from 3GPP access.
Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in
clause 8.1
1) The UE uses a 3GPP access system. It has an IP address that is supported
over S5 interface, this IP address will be used as a HoA over the S2c
reference point.
2) At this point the UE decides to initiate non-3GPP access procedure. The
decision is based on any number of reasons e.g. local policies of the UE.
3) The UE shall perform access authentication and authorization in the
non-3GPP access system as defined by TS 33.402 [45] unless the conditions in
TS 33.402 [45] are met that allow to skip this procedure. In the roaming case
signalling may be routed via a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the VPLMN, as specified in TS
23.234 [5]. As part of the AAA exchange for network access authentication, the
3GPP AAA Server and/or the 3GPP AAA Proxy may return to the non-3GPP access
system a set of home/visited operator\'s policies to be enforced on the usage
of local IP address, or IPv6 prefix, allocated by the access system upon
successful authentication.
4) The L3 connection is established between the UE and the Trusted Non-3GPP
Access system. As a result of this procedure, an IPv4 address or an IPv6
address/prefix is also assigned to the UE by the access system (i.e. a Local
IP address that will be used as a Care-of Address for DSMIPv6 over the S2c
reference point).
5) The Trusted non-3GPP IP Access initiates a Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
Based e.g. on the UE identity and user profile, operator\'s policies and the
IP-CAN type, the PCRF decides on the QoS policy rules and completes the GW
control session establishment towards the access gateway (5b)
In the roaming case, PCC signalling is sent via a vPCRF server in the VPLMN
6) If bootstrapping was not performed prior to the handover defined here, the
UE may discover PDN GW address using MIPv6 bootstrapping procedures defined in
clause 4.5.2. If the PDN GW discovered by the UE upon MIPv6 bootstrapping is
different from the PDN GW that was in use on the 3GPP access, a PDN GW
reallocation as per steps 2-3 in clause 6.10 is performed. The target PDN GW
that is communicated to the UE as part of the reallocation procedure must be
exactly the PDN GW that was serving the UE while on the 3GPP access.
7) The UE sends a DSMIPv6 BU message to the PDN GW to register its CoA, the
CoA is the local IP address allocated in step 4. The UE shall inform the PDN
GW that the whole home prefix shall be moved.
8) If PCC is supported, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session
Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
In the roaming case, PCC signalling is sent via a vPCRF server in the VPLMN.
9) The PDN GW sends the MIP Binding Ack to the UE. Since this step is
triggered by the Binding Update message from the UE in step 7, it can occur
after step 7 and does not need to wait for step 8.
The PDN GW may send message 9 before the procedure in step message 8 is
complete.
10) The PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure
specified in TS 23.203 [19] by sending a message with the information of
mobility protocol tunnelling encapsulation header to the Trusted non-3GPP IP
Access. In case the QoS rules have changed, the updated QoS rules shall also
be included in this message.
11) The UE continues with IP service using the same IP address in step 1.
12) The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure
in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer
Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.
### 8.4.3 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access Handover with DSMIPv6
over S2c
In this scenario, the session starts in 3GPP access (e.g. E-UTRAN) using
either GTP or PMIPv6 is used over S5, or no S5 is used (co-located Serving GW
and PDN GW). ). In the roaming case instead of S5, S8 is used. The session
hands over to an untrusted non-3GPP access system that does not use PMIPv6
where the UE will receive a different prefix from the ePDG than the one it was
using in 3GPP access system The UE subsequently initiates DSMIPv6 with the its
PDN GW to maintain the IP session.
Support of PCC for Untrusted non-3GPP accesses is optional. The PCC
interactions shown in Figure 8.4.3-1 are omitted if the Untrusted non-3GPP
access does not support PCC. If PCC is not supported, policy rules may be
configured by other means.
In the non-roaming case, none of the optional entities in Figure 8.4.3-1 are
involved.
The optional entities are involved in other cases.
\- In the roaming cases, however, the 3GPP AAA Proxy mediates all interaction
between the 3GPP AAA Server in the PLMN and entities in the VPLMN and non-3GPP
access.
\- Similarly, interaction between hPCRF in the HPLMN and entities in the VPLMN
and non-3GPP access occurs by way of the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In both these
cases, messages are relayed by the optional entities towards and from the
HPLMN.
Figure 8.4.3-1: 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with S2c (DSMIPv6)
Handover
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the following applies:
\- If the UE is connected to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access before the
handover of PDN connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2
to 4 shall be skipped.
\- If the UE is connected only to 3GPP access before the handover of PDN
connections to untrusted non-3GPP access is triggered, steps 2 to 4 shall be
performed.
\- Steps 6 to 10 shall be repeated for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from 3GPP access. If not performed in 3GPP access prior to the
handover, Step 5 shall also be repeated for each PDN connection that is being
transferred from 3GPP access.
Other impacts related to the handover for multiple PDN GWs are described in
clause 8.1
1\. The UE uses a 3GPP access system. It has an IP address that is supported
over S5 interface, this IP address will be used as a HoA over the S2c
reference point.
2\. At this point the UE decides to initiate non-3GPP access procedure. The
decision is based on any number of reasons e.g. local policies of the UE.
3 Access authentication procedure between UE and the 3GPP EPC may be performed
as defined by TS 33.402 [45].
4\. The IKEv2 tunnel establishment procedure is started by the UE. The UE may
indicate in a notification part of the IKEv2 authentication request that it
supports MOBIKE. The ePDG IP address to which the UE needs to form IPsec
tunnel is discovered via DNS query as specified in clause 4.5.4. After the UE
is authenticated, UE is also authorized for access to the APN. The procedure
is as described in TS 33.234 [7].
NOTE: It is assumed that the access system is aware that network-based
mobility procedures do not need to be initiated.
5\. The ePDG sends the final IKEv2 message with the assigned IP address in
IKEv2 Configuration payloads. The IKEv2 procedure is completed and the IPSEC
tunnel is set-up. In this procedure, the assigned IP address is an IPv4
address or an IPv6 prefix assigned to the UE by the ePDG and the assigned IP
address that will be used as a Care-of Address for DSMIPv6 over the S2c
reference point.
6\. If bootstrapping was not performed prior to the handover defined here, the
UE may discover PDN GW address using DSMIPv6 bootstrapping procedures defined
in clause 4.5.2. If the PDN GW discovered by the UE upon MIPv6 bootstrapping
is different from the PDN GW that was in use on the 3GPP access, a PDN GW
reallocation as per steps 2-3 in clause 6.10 is performed. The target PDN GW
that is communicated to the UE as part of the reallocation procedure must be
exactly the PDN GW that was serving the UE while on the 3GPP access.
7\. The UE sends a DSMIPv6 BU message to the PDN GW to register its CoA. The
UE shall inform the PDN GW that the whole home prefix shall be moved.
8\. If PCC is supported, the PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session
Modification Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain
the rules required for the PDN GW in the VPLMN or HPLMN to function as the
PCEF for all the active sessions the UE has established with the new IP‑CAN
type as a result of the handover procedure.
9\. The PDN GW sends the DSMIPv6 Binding Ack to the UE. Since this step is
triggered by the Binding Update message from the UE in step 6, it can occur
after step 6 and does not need to wait for step 7.
The PDN GW may send message 8 before the procedure in step 8 is complete.
10\. The UE continues with IP service using the same IP address in step 1.
11\. The PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN Disconnection
procedure in 3GPP access as defined in clause 5.6.2.2 or the PDN GW Initiated
Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [4], clause 5.4.4.1.
## 8.5 Handover with Access Network Discovery and Selection
### 8.5.1 Handover between 3GPP Access and Trusted / Untrusted Non-3GPP IP
Access with access network discovery and selection
The figure below shows the main steps involved in a handover between a 3GPP
access and a non-3GPP IP access (also called an inter-system handover) when
network discovery and selection information is provided by the network (see
clause 4.8). This information is provided in order to control the UE\'s inter-
system handover decisions and in order to reduce the battery consumption for
inter-system mobility.
Figure 8.5.1-1: Handover between 3GPP Access and trusted / untrusted non-3GPP
IP Access with Access Network Discovery and Selection
1\. The UE is connected with a source access network (either a 3GPP access or
a trusted / untrusted non-3GPP IP access). Its radio interfaces not connected
to any access network may be in power saving or powered down mode.
2\. If the inter-system mobility policies (see clause 4.8) in the UE indicate
that inter-system mobility is allowed with at least one access technology
type, then the UE may decide to discover neighbour access networks with
assistance by the network. In this case, the UE discovers the address of ANDSF
(if needed) as specified in clause 4.8, establishes secure communication with
the ANDSF as specified in TS 33.402 [45] and requests access network info from
the ANDSF as specified in the steps below.
3\. The UE sends an Access Network Info Request (UE Capabilities, UE Location)
message to the H‑ANDSF (in the non-roaming and roaming case) and the V‑ANDSF
(in the roaming case) to retrieve network discovery and selection information.
The UE Capabilities indicate the capabilities of the UE pertaining to access
network discovery, such as the access technology types that can be supported
by the UE. If the UE Location is available in the UE, it should be included in
the message to indicate the UE\'s current location, e.g. for the 3GPP access,
Cell ID, TAI, and/or GPS (if available). If the UE Location is not included
then other mechanisms may be used by ANDSF to identify the UE\'s current
location.
NOTE 1: In this Release of the specification, no mechanisms are specified for
the ANDSF to identify the UE\'s current location, if this information is not
provided by the UE.
4\. The ANDSF responds with an Access Network Info Response (Available Access
Network Info, Updated Inter-system Mobility Policies) message to the UE. The
Available Access Networks Info contains a list of access networks that are
available in the vicinity of UE. If the UE included one or more access
technology types in the Access Network Info Request, then information about
neighbour access network with the requested access technology types is
included. The Updated Inter-system Mobility Policies may be included in order
to update / install operator defined rules / preferences in the UE. These
rules / preferences may indicate a preference value for an available access
network and help the UE select an available access network that is more
preferable to the current access network.
5\. The UE powers up its appropriate radio interface(s) (if needed) and
measures the available access networks for which inter-system mobility is
allowed, as indicated by the updated / current inter-system mobility policies.
The UE selects the most preferable available access network for inter-system
mobility based on the inter-system mobility policies and user preferences.
6\. If the UE selects a preferable access network for handover, then the UE
initiates handover to the selected access network as described in clause 8.
NOTE 2: Steps 2, 3 and 4 in the above procedure may not immediately result in
an inter-system handover (steps 5 and 6).
## 8.6 Handovers between non-3GPP IP access with GTP on S2b and 3GPP Access
### 8.6.1 Handover from Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with GTP on S2b to 3GPP
Access
#### 8.6.1.1 General Procedure for GTP based S5/S8 for E-UTRAN Access
The steps involved in the handover from an untrusted non-3GPP IP access to
E-UTRAN connected to EPC are depicted below for both the non-roaming and
roaming cases and when GTP is used on S2b. It is assumed that while the UE is
served by the untrusted non-3GPP IP access, GTP tunnel(s) are established
between the ePDG and the PDN GW in the EPC.
Figure 8.6.1.1-1: Handover from Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN with
GTP on S2b and GTP on S5/S8 interfaces
The home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure.
\- In the LBO case, the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, sending the QoS Policy
Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN. The
vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment from the PDN GW and forwards it to the
hPCRF.
\- In the non-roaming and home routed roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved.
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the same behaviour as described in
clause 8.2.1.1 also applies to this procedure.
1) The UE uses an untrusted non-3GPP access system and is being served by PDN
GW.
2 to 17) as for steps 2 to 17 of clause 8.2.1.1.
On step 9, the Charging Id provided by the PGW is the Charging Id previously
assigned to the default bearer of the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access on
the S2b interface, although the Charging Id still applies to the non-3GPP
access.
On step 13, the Charging Id previously in use for the default bearer in the
non-3GPP access on the S2b interface now applies to the default bearer in 3GPP
access.
NOTE: Two GTP sessions may exist in the PDN GW for the same UE and APN over
the S2b and S5/S8 interfaces during a transient period.
18) The PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in
the untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 7.9.2
#### 8.6.1.2 General Procedure for GTP-based S5/S8 for UTRAN/GERAN
The steps involved in the handover from an untrusted non-3GPP IP access to
UTRAN/GERAN connected to EPC are depicted below for both the non-roaming and
roaming cases and when GTP is used on S2b. It is assumed that while the UE is
served by the untrusted non-3GPP IP access, GTP tunnel(s) are established
between the non-3GPP access network and the PDN GW in the EPC.
NOTE 1: This procedure is applicable to S4-SGSN only.
The home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure.
\- In the LBO case, the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, sending the QoS Policy
Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN. The
vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment from the PDN GW and forwards it to the
hPCRF.
\- In the non-roaming and home routed roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved.
Figure 8.6.1.2-1: Handover from Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to UTRAN/GERAN
with GTP on S2b and GTP on S5/S8 interfaces
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the same behaviour as described in
clause 8.2.1.3 also applies to this procedure.
1) The UE uses an untrusted non-3GPP access system and is being served by PDN
GW.
2) to 16) As for steps 2 to 16 of clause 8.2.1.3.
On step 11, the Charging Id provided by the PGW is the Charging Id previously
assigned to the default bearer of the PDN connection in the non-3GPP access on
the S2b interface, although the Charging Id still applies to the non-3GPP
access.
On step 14, the Charging Id previously in use for the default bearer in the
non-3GPP access on the S2b interface now applies to the default bearer in 3GPP
access.
NOTE 2: Two GTP sessions may exist in the PDN GW for the same UE and APN over
the S2b and S5/S8 interfaces during a transient period.
17) The PDN GW shall initiate resource allocation deactivation procedure in
the untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 7.9.2.
### 8.6.2 Handover from 3GPP access to untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with GTP
on S2b
#### 8.6.2.1 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access Handover with GTP on
S2b
This clause shows a call flow for a handover when a UE moves from a 3GPP
Access to an untrusted non-3GPP access network. GTP is assumed to be used on
the S5/S8 interface and GTP is used on the S2b interface.
Figure 8.6.2.1-1: Handover from 3GPP Access to Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access
with GTP on S2b
The home routed roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1), LBO (Figure 4.2.3-4) and non-roaming
(Figure 4.2.2-1) scenarios are depicted in the figure.
\- In the LBO case, the vPCRF acts as an intermediary, sending the QoS Policy
Rules Provision from the hPCRF in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN. The
vPCRF receives the Acknowledgment from the PDN GW and forwards it to the
hPCRF.
\- In the non-roaming and home routed roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved.
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs the same behaviour as described in
clause 8.2.3 also applies to this procedure.
The optional interaction steps between the PDN gateway and the PCRF in the
procedures only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise
policy may be statically configured in the PDN gateway.
A.1) The ePDG sends a Create Session Request (IMSI, APN, Handover Indication,
RAT type, ePDG TEID of the control plane, ePDG Address for the user plane,
ePDG TEID of the user plane, EPS Bearer Identity) message to the PDN GW. The
RAT type indicates the non-3GPP IP access technology type. If the UE supports
IP address preservation and included the address in step 3, the ePDG sets the
\'Handover Indication\' in the Creation Session Request to allow the PDN GW to
re-allocate the same IP address or prefix that was assigned to the UE while it
was connected to the 3GPP IP access and to initiate a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN
Session Modification Procedure with the PCRF.
NOTE: In a non-3GPP to 3GPP access handover, the \'Handover Indication\' leads
the PDN GW to delay switching the DL user plane traffic from non-3GPP to 3GPP
until a subsequent Modify Bearer Request is received. In a 3GPP to non-3GPP
handover scenario with GTP based S2b, the \'Handover Indication\' should not
delay the switching of DL user plane traffic from 3GPP to non-3GPP access.
B.1) Step B.1 is the same as Step B of clause 8.2.3, with the following
addition:
\- the PDN GW may create dedicated bearers during this procedure.
B.2) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection and obtains authorization
information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may
update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
C.1) The PDN GW responds with a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for
the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control
plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR,
Charging ID, Cause) message to the ePDG. The Create Session Response contains
the IP address and/or the prefix that was assigned to the UE while it was
connected to the 3GPP IP access. The Charging Id provided by the PGW is the
Charging Id previously assigned to the default bearer of the PDN connection in
the 3GPP access.
D.1) At the end of the handover procedure, the PDN connectivity service is
provided by IPsec connectivity between the UE and the ePDG concatenated with
S2b bearer(s) between the ePDG and the PDN GW.

### 9.1.2 Reference Points
#### 9.1.2.1 Reference Point List
**S101** : It enables interactions between EPS and HRPD access to allow for
pre-registration and handover signalling with the target system.
**S103** : This User Plane interface is used to forward DL data to minimize
packet losses in mobility from E-UTRAN to HRPD.
#### 9.1.2.2 Requirements for the S101 Reference Point
The S101 interface supports procedures for Pre-Registration, Session
Maintenance and Active handovers between E-UTRAN and HRPD networks. This is
based on tunnelling over S101 signalling of one technology while the UE is in
the other technology. The HRPD air interface messages tunnelled over S101 in
E‑UTRAN to HRPD mobility are defined in 3GPP2 C.S0087‑0 [49].
The S101 reference point shall support the following requirements:
\- HRPD and E-UTRAN/EPS messages shall be transported as opaque containers
without modifications by the MME or HRPD AN.
\- Messages may carry separate information IEs to indicate status, message
types (e.g. handover command) forwarding addresses etc. as required by
signalling procedures.
\- Provide identifiers (i.e. S101 Session ID) to distinguish messages
belonging to different UEs in order to allow responses originating from the
target system to an UE to be appropriately forwarded to the UE by the source
system.
\- Reliable transport for S101 messages should be provided at the application
layer and will not require transport layer reliability mechanism.
#### 9.1.2.3 S101 Protocol Stack
The figure below shows the protocol stack for the S101 interface.
{width="4.291666666666667in" height="2.0729166666666665in"}
**Legend:**
\- S101 Application Protocol (S101-AP): It is the Application Layer Protocol
between the MME and HRPD AN
\- User Datagram Protocol (UDP): This protocol transfers messages. UDP is
defined in RFC 768.
\- S101 Application Protocol (S101-AP) provides application layer reliability
for its messages, if required.
Figure 9.1.2.3-1: Protocol Stack for the S101 Reference Point
#### 9.1.2.4 S101 Session Identifier
All S101 messages contain a S101 Session ID which serves to identify the UE
context at the MME and the HRPD AN. The S101 Session ID uniquely and globally
identifies the UE.
#### 9.1.2.5 Requirements for the S103 Reference Point
The S103 interface between the Serving GW and HS‑GW supports the forwarding of
DL data during mobility from E-UTRAN to HRPD. Signalling procedures on the
S101 interface are used to set up tunnels on the S103 interface.
The S103 reference point shall support the following requirements:
\- The S103 interface shall support the ability to tunnel traffic on a per-UE,
per-PDN basis
\- The S103 interface shall support Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) RFC
2784 [23] including the Key Field extension RFC 2890 [24]. The Key field value
of each GRE packet header uniquely identifies the PDN connectivity that the
GRE packet payload is associated with.

## 9.2 Overview of Handover Procedures
### 9.2.1 General
The S101 reference point, and E-UTRAN and HRPD access is used for transparent
transfer of pre-registration and handover signalling between the UE and the
target access system
The purpose of the procedures is to minimise the total service interruption
time experienced at the UE, by allowing the UE to attach and perform service
activation (in the case of E-UTRAN) or to perform a session configuration or
traffic allocation request (in the case of HRPD) in the target access system
before leaving the source access system.
In case where the UE is connected to the E-UTRAN and conditions are such that
a handover to HRPD may be required, the source system provides the UE with
sufficient information to perform pre-registration with the target HRPD access
and core network, over the S101 tunnelling interface. If conditions
subsequently warrant that a handover should occur, the handover signalling
will also be performed over the S101 tunnelling interface. Once the UE is
ready to connect to the target system, it switches to the HRPD access.
Alternatively, the E-UTRAN may redirect the UE to HRPD using RRC Connection
Release with Redirection Information set as specified in clause 5.3.8 of TS
36.331 [52]. If pre-registration has not been performed successfully, upon
receiving the redirection message, the UE acquires the HRPD channel and
performs the non-optimized handover according to clause 8.2.2 from step 3
onwards. If pre-registration is successful, upon receiving the redirection
message, the UE follows the RRC Connection Release with Redirection procedure
to reselect the HRPD cell according to TS 36.331 [52] and then performs the
idle-mode optimized handover procedure as specified in clause 9.4 from step 3
onwards.
In case where the UE is connected to the HRPD and conditions are such that a
handover to E-UTRAN may be required, the source system provides the UE with
sufficient information to perform pre-registration with the target EPS. The
pre-registration may be performed over the S101 tunnelling interface. If
conditions subsequently warrant that a handover should occur, the handover
signalling may also be performed over the S101 tunnelling interface. Once the
UE is ready to connect to the target system, it switches to the E-UTRAN
access.
### 9.2.2 Support for HO of IMS Emergency Sessions
In order to support handover from E-UTRAN to HRPD of limited service state
UEs, the following additional clarifications apply:
\- When a limited service state UE without a UICC or with an unauthenticated
IMSI, initiates emergency attach procedures for handover or initial attach to
HRPD access to setup emergency sessions, the UE provides its IMEI during the
attach procedure. The IMSI, if available, is also provided to the HRPD access
by the UE during the attach procedure. If IMSI is not available or IMSI is not
authenticated, an IMEI based NAI is used on the S2a interface in this case.
Also, authentication with HSS is either skipped or if performed and fails, the
HRPD attach procedure is continued.
\- In the above scenario, for UEs that supports both E-UTRAN and HRPD access
and handover is supported in the network between these accesses, the HRPD
access selects a statically configured PDN GW for the UE. This statically
configured PDN GW is the same as the statically-configured PDN GW selected for
the UE in E‑UTRAN access.
\- For optimized handover between E-UTRAN and HRPD for Emergency attached UEs
in E-UTRAN without an UICC or with an unauthenticated IMSI, IMEI shall be used
as the S101 Session ID to identify the UE within the MME and HRPD access
nodes. If the IMSI is unauthenticated, the IMSI is provided on the S101 tunnel
to the HRPD access with an indication that it is unauthenticated.
NOTE: For optimized handover from E‑UTRAN to HRPD the source access system
does not release bearers, the management of bearers in HRPD target network is
out of the scope of this specification (for example whether HRPD releases non-
emergency bearers or not, when the UE is not authorized for service in HRPD).
The procedures for both optimized and non-optimized handovers specified in the
other sections in this specification support, without modifications, handover
of emergency sessions from E-UTRAN to HRPD access for normal mode UE\'s, i.e.
UEs with IMSI that authenticated successfully.
In this Release of the specification, handover of IMS Emergency Sessions from
HRPD access to E-UTRAN access is not supported.
## 9.3 Optimized Active Handover: E-UTRAN Access to cdma2000 HRPD Access
### 9.3.0 Introduction
This clause describes the Optimised Handover from E-UTRAN Access to cdma2000
HRPD Access in two phases, pre-registration and the actual handover. In pre-
registration phase the UE registers to the cdma2000 HRPD Access, while the UE
remains to be connected to the E-UTRAN. The pre-registration may take place
well in advance of the need to make the actual handover. In the handover
phase, the connection is handed over to cdma2000 HRPD Access, and the UE
leaves E-UTRAN.
### 9.3.1 Pre-registration Phase
Figure 9.3.1-1 illustrates a high-level call flow for the optimised E-UTRAN to
HRPD handover procedure, Pre-registration phase.
Figure 9.3.1-1: HRPD registration via LTE/SAE tunnel
1\. The UE is registered with E-UTRAN/MME. It may have an ongoing data session
established over EPS/E-UTRAN access.
2\. Based on a Radio Layer trigger (e.g., an indication from the E-UTRAN when
the UE is in connected state or an indication over the broadcast channel), the
UE decides to initiate a pre-registration procedure with potential target HRPD
access. The pre-registration procedure allows the UE to establish and maintain
a dormant session in the target HRPD access, while attached to the
E-UTRAN/MME.
3\. Registration to the HRPD is achieved by exchanging a series of HRPD
messages between the UE and the HRPD Access Network. The HRPD signalling that
is tunnelled transparently over the E‑UTRAN and EPC creates an HRPD session
context between the UE and the HRPD Access Network. The procedures described
below are used in steps 3, 5, 8 and 9.
The UE generates an UL Information Transfer message (UL HRPD message). The UL
HRPD message is transferred from the UE to the eNodeB as a parameter in the UL
Information Transfer.
The eNodeB sends Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message (UL HRPD message,
Sector ID) to the MME. The SectorID is statically configured in the eNodeB.
The MME selects an HRPD access node address. In order to be able to
distinguish S101 signalling transactions belonging to different UEs, an S101
Session ID is used to identify signalling related to that UE on S101. The MME
sends a Direct Transfer Request message (S101 Session ID, SectorID, UL HRPD
message) to the HRPD access node. The MME determines the correct HRPD access
node entity and address from the SectorID.
NOTE 1: There is an unambiguous mapping from the SectorID to the HRPD access
node address.
The HRPD Access Network sends signalling in the DL direction to the MME using
Direct Transfer Request message (S101 Session ID, DL HRPD message). The S101
Session ID is used to associate the signalling to a particular UE.
The MME sends the information on to the eNodeB using the Downlink S1 CDMA2000
Tunnelling message (DL HRPD message).
The eNodeB uses the DL information transfer message (DL HRPD message) to
transport the signalling the UE.
If UE is handing over emergency sessions to HRPD access, the UE informs the
HRPD access that it is an emergency handover. In case the UE is in limited
service state and does not have an IMSI or its IMSI is unauthenticated, IMEI
is used as a Session ID. If the IMSI is unauthenticated, the IMSI is also
provided on the S101 tunnel to the HRPD access with an indication that it is
unauthenticated.
4\. The HRPD Access Network creates a signalling relationship with the HS‑GW
for the UE with interactions in HRPD network A10 / A11 interfaces.
If the HRPD Access Node is not configured to support emergency handovers, then
it shall reject any handover request that indicates Emergency Handover.
5\. The UE, HS‑GW, and 3GPP AAA exchange EAP‑AKA**\'** signalling to
authenticate the UE on the HRPD system. The HS‑GW receives the APN(s) and PDN
GW identity(es) information from AAA during authentication.
If the UE is performing an Emergency handover to HRPD access for emergency
service and the HRPD access supports Emergency handover, the HPRD access skips
the authentication procedure or the HRPD access accepts that the
authentication may fail and continues the handover procedure. A statically
configured PDN GW is selected by the HRPD access for the UE for
unauthenticated UEs.
6\. The HS‑GW initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment Procedure with
the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. If the HS-GW supports UE/NW bearer
control mode, the PCRF provides the rules required for the HS‑GW to perform
the bearer binding for all the active sessions the UE may establish as a
result of the handover procedure. For each PDN connection, if the UE has
acquired an IPv6 prefix via the 3GPP access, the PCRF returns the IPv6 prefix
of UE to the HSGW and the HSGW includes it in the TFT sent to the UE.
7\. The UE and HS‑GW exchange signalling to establish context to support the
bearer traffic environment in use over the E‑UTRAN.
8\. At any time prior to the Handover Phase, if session maintenance activity
is required, the UE or HRPD access network shall perform session maintenance
signalling by tunnelling the HRPD session maintenance messages over the S101.
If QoS parameters require updating, then this step includes the PCRF
interaction. The MME uses the S101 Session ID to identify the UE context over
the S101 interface.
NOTE 2: Between Step 7 and Step 8 the UE may enter ECM-IDLE state. To execute
the session maintenance procedures at Step 8 it is necessary for the UE to
enter ECM-CONNECTED state.
9 PCRF interactions due to session maintenance can be initiated by the PCRF or
the HS‑GW. The PCRF initiates the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision
Procedure specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The HS‑GW initiates the Gateway Control
and QoS Policy Rules Request Procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [19].
### 9.3.2 Handover Phase
Figure 9.3.2-1 illustrates a high-level call flow for the optimised E-UTRAN to
HRPD handover procedure, Handover phase. The prerequisite of the handover
phase is the successfully performed Pre-registration phase as it is specified
in clause 9.3.1.
Figure 9.3.2-1: E-UTRAN to HRPD handover
0\. Ongoing session established over EPS/E-UTRAN access.
1\. The eNodeB receives measurement reports from the UE.
2\. The eNodeB makes the handover decision.
3\. The handover decision is signalled to the UE with Handover from E‑UTRA
preparation request message.
4\. UE sends an UL handover preparation transfer message (HRPD message
starting HO access) to the eNodeB. The HRPD message starting HO access will be
carried transparently to the HRPD access node, and its purpose is to request
information for accessing an HRPD traffic channel. The message indicates to
the eNodeB that the UE is responding to the Handover from E‑UTRA preparation
request message, and is requesting information for accessing an HRPD traffic
channel.
5\. The eNodeB sends the Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message (HRPD message
starting HO access, and SectorID, CDMA2000 HO Required Indication) to the MME.
The SectorID is statically configured in the eNodeB. The eNodeB will also
include CDMA2000 HO Required Indication IE to Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling
message, which indicates to the MME that the handover preparation has started.
6\. When receiving Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message with CDMA2000 HO
Required Indication the MME determines an HRPD access node address based on
the SectorID. An S101 Session ID is used to identify signalling related to
that UE on S101. The MME sends a Direct Transfer Request message (S101 Session
ID, SectorID, PDN GW Identity(es), GRE key(s) for uplink traffic, APN(s), HRPD
message starting HO access) to the HRPD access node.
When GTP based S5/S8 is used in the EPS, the MME creates the uplink GRE keys
from the uplink TEIDs of the default bearers using a standardized algorithm.
In this way only one GRE key per PDN connection is created. The PDN GW shall
be able to identify any PDN connection based on the GRE key created from the
uplink TEID of the default bearer of that PDN connection.
NOTE: When a PDN GW that supports both GTP and PMIP based interfaces allocates
a TEID for a GTP tunnel, it also allocates and memorizes a corresponding GRE
key if the tunnel is created for a default bearer. Later the PDN GW is able to
identify the PDN connection based on the corresponding GRE key, i.e. the PDN
GW also assigns the corresponding GRE key to that particular PDN connection
and it cannot use that GRE key for any other PDN connection.
7\. The HRPD access network allocates the requested radio access resources,
and requests a forwarding address from HS‑GW. The information sent in the
request from the HRPD access network to HS‑GW includes APN(s), PDN GW
Identity(es) and GRE key(s) for uplink traffic. The response includes the
HS‑GW Address and GRE key(s) for forwarded traffic on S103. There is one GRE
key for each PDN connection for which traffic is to be forwarded.
8\. The HRPD access network sends the Direct Transfer Request message (S101
Session ID, HRPD message with HO access information, HS‑GW Address and GRE
key(s) for forwarded traffic, CDMA2000 HO Status) to the MME. The HS‑GW
Address and GRE key(s) for forwarded traffic are sent if data forwarding
applies. If the HRPD access network did not allocate the resources as
requested, this will be indicated to the MME and eNodeB with the CDMA2000 HO
Status IE, and the embedded HRPD message indicates the failure to the UE.
9a. If Direct Transfer Request message included HS‑GW Address and GRE key(s)
for forwarded traffic, the MME determines which of the S1‑U bearers should be
forwarded to the HRPD and configures resources for indirect data forwarding by
sending Create Forwarding Tunnel Request (HS‑GW address, GRE key(s) for
forwarded traffic, EPS bearer ID(s) subject to forwarding) to the Serving GW.
The MME shall select the same Serving GW which is used as the anchor point for
the UE to perform the data forwarding.
9b. The Serving GW confirms data forwarding resources for S103 and allocates
forwarding address for S1 in Create Forwarding Tunnel Response (cause, S‑GW
address, S1‑U uplink TEID(s)). The S1‑U uplink TEIDs are provided one per S1‑U
bearers subject to forwarding.
10\. The MME sends the Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message (HRPD message
with HO access information, S‑GW address, S1-U uplink TEID(s), CDMA2000 HO
Status) to the E-UTRAN. If the CDMA2000 HO Status indicates that handover
preparation failed, the Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling message will be sent
with appropriate cause, and the embedded HRPD message that indicates the
failure to the UE. The message from the MME provides the eNodeB also with the
data forwarding S1‑U uplink TEIDs allocated at the Serving GW if data
forwarding applies.
11\. The E-UTRAN forwards the HRPD message with HO access information to the
UE in Mobility from E‑UTRA message. This is perceived by the UE as a Handover
Command message. If handover preparation failed, DL Information transfer
message will be sent instead, with the embedded HRPD message that indicates
the failure to the UE.
If data forwarding applies, the E-UTRAN starts forwarding received downlink
data to the S‑GW on a per-S1‑U bearer forwarding tunnel, which then forwards
these packets on a per-PDN per-UE S103 tunnel to the HS‑GW. The forwarding
starts at the same moment as the Mobility from E-UTRA message is sent to the
UE.
12\. The UE retunes to the HRPD radio access network and performs traffic
channel acquisition.
13\. The UE sends an HRPD Traffic Channel Complete (TCC) message to the HRPD
access network.
14a-f The E-UTRAN triggers switching the flow in the EPC with the following
sequence:
14a. The HRPD access network sends A11 request signalling to HS‑GW to start
setting up the U-Plane connection between the HRPD access network and HS‑GW.
14b. The HS‑GW sends Proxy Binding Update to PDN GW. The HS‑GW sends the all
zero IPv4 Home Address (0.0.0.0) or all zero IPv6 Home Prefix (0::/0) in the
PBU message. In order to support session continuity, the P‑GW performs the
Binding Cache entry existence test based on the NAI and assigns the same IPv4
Home Address and/or IPv6 Home Prefix to the UE and acknowledge in the PBA
message.
14c. The PDN GW switches the flow from Serving GW to HS‑GW, and sends Proxy
Binding Acknowledge to HS‑GW, including the Charging ID for the PDN
connection.
14d. The HS‑GW responses with A11 response signalling to the HRPD access
network.
14e. The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules
required for the PDN GW to function as the PCEF for all the active IP sessions
the UE has established with new IP-CAN type. Otherwise, information configured
with the P‑GW may be used to determine policy. Since Steps 14c and 14e are
both triggered by the Proxy Binding Update in Step 14b, Steps 14c and 14e may
occur in parallel.
14f. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection and obtains authorization
information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may
update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
For a multiple PDN connection, steps 14b-14c and 14e‑14f are performed for
each PDN connection.
Multiple PDN connections to the same APN can be supported using PDN connection
identities in the same way as it is specified for S2a procedures.
15a. The HRPD access network sends a Notification Request (HO Complete, S101
session ID) message to the MME (including the S101 session ID to identify the
UE context).
15b. The MME responds by sending a Notification Response (S101 session ID) to
the HRPD access network.
If data forwarding was not applied in step 9, the MME shall skip step 17, and
shall perform steps 16 and 18.
If data forwarding was applied in step 9, a timer in MME is started to
supervise when the EPS bearer resources in the Serving GW and the temporary
resources used for indirect data forwarding in the Serving GW shall be
released. The uses of the timer is defined in TS 23.401 [4]. The MME shall
perform steps 16, 17 and 18 upon the timer expiry.
If the EPS bearer resources release is triggered by a Delete Bearer Request
message (from step 19) received before the timer expiry, the MME shall stop
the timer and skip steps 16, 17 and 18.
16a. The MME releases the UE context in the source E-UTRAN by sending a UE
Context Release Command message to the eNodeB.
16b. The source eNodeB releases its bearer resources related to the UE and
responds with a UE Context Release Complete message.
17a. The MME sends a Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message to
the Serving GW.
17b. The Serving GW releases the temporary resources used for indirect data
forwarding which were allocated at step 9. The Serving GW acknowledges with
Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response message.
18a. The MME releases the EPS bearer resources in the Serving GW by sending a
Delete Session Request message to the Serving GW. The MME shall indicate to
the Serving GW that the Serving GW shall not initiate a delete procedure
towards the PDN GW.
18b. The Serving GW acknowledges resource removal with Delete Session Response
(Cause) message.
19\. At any time after step 14c, the PDN GW shall initiate the PDN GW
Initiated PDN Disconnection procedure at E‑UTRAN as defined in clause 5.6.2.2
or the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401
[4], clause 5.4.4.1. If data forwarding was applied, the forwarding tunnel
established in step 9 shall be also released in this step.
## 9.4 Optimized Idle-mode Mobility: E-UTRAN Access to cdma2000 HRPD Access
This procedure is used in the case the UE has a dormant HRPD session in the
target HRPD network, either through the pre-registration procedure or previous
HRPD attachment.
Figure 9.4-1: E-UTRAN to HRPD mobility in idle-mode
1\. The UE is attached to E-UTRAN network and stay in ECM_IDLE state. The UE
has a dormant HRPD session in the target HRPD network, either through the pre-
registration procedure or previous HRPD attachment
2\. The UE is in idle mode. Based on some trigger, the idle UE decides to
perform cell re-selection to the HRPD system. Note, the cell re-selection
decision can be made at any time when the UE is attached in the E-UTRAN
network (including as soon as the UE has completed pre-registration).
3\. The UE follows 3GPP2 procedures in [49] to inform the HRPD access network
the UE has performed an inter-technology idle mode mobility event and is now
tuned to HRPD.
4\. The HRPD access indicates to the HSGW that the UE has moved to HRPD.
4a. The HS‑GW fetches the PDN GW identity for all the active PDN connections
from the 3GPP AAA Server.
5\~6. The HS‑GW exchanges a PMIP BU/BA with the PDN GW. The UE address
information in PMIP BA returns the IP Address assigned to the UE. In this
message, the Charging ID is also carried for charging correlation purposes. At
this point the user plane is switched in the PDN GW towards the HRPD access
network via the HS‑GW. Multiple PDN connections to the same APN can be
supported using PDN connection identities in the same way as it is specified
for S2a procedures.
6a. The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure
with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain any new QoS policy and
charging rules for all the active sessions as a result of the handover
procedure. Since steps 6 and 6a are both triggered by the Proxy Binding Update
in step 5, steps 6 and 6a may occur in parallel.
6b. The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and the APN
corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection and obtains authorization
information from the 3GPP AAA Server. The message includes information that
identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. The 3GPP AAA Server may
update the information registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
For multiple PDN connections, steps 5‑6 and 6a‑6b are performed for each PDN
connection.
7\. The HS‑GW acknowledges the HRPD access network.
8\. At any time after step 6, the P‑GW shall initiate the PDN GW Initiated PDN
Disconnection procedure as defined in clause 5.6.2.2, so that any resources
are released in the EPS serving nodes that were serving the UE in E‑UTRAN
access before the idle-mode mobility to HRPD took place.
## 9.5 Optimised Active Handover: cdma2000 HRPD Access to EUTRAN
### 9.5.1 General Procedure for GTP-based S5/S8
Figure 9.5.1-1 illustrates a high-level call flow for an optimised HRPD to
EUTRAN handover procedure.
Figure 9.5.1-1: HRPD to EUTRAN handover with GTP-based S5/S8
NOTE 1: UE may need to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure in step 19.
NOTE 2: UE may perform E-UTRAN attach directly over the E-UTRAN radio.
1\. The UE is registered with HRPD. If may have an ongoing data session
established over HRPD access.
2\. Handover decision occurs.
NOTE 3: The means by which a handover decision is made shall be specified in
3GPP2.
3\. Upon handover decision, the UE initiates the Attach procedure by
transmission of a NAS Attach Request message over tunnelling mechanism to the
HRPD AN.
4\. When receiving Message X the HRPD AN selects an MME and TAI. This
selection is based on a mapping from the current HRPD reference sector to
corresponding MMEs and TAI. An S101 Session ID is used to identify signalling
related to that UE on S101. The HRPD AN sends an S101 DT to the MME. MME
constructs TAI List for the UE based on the received TAI.
NOTE 4: It is assumed that the NAS UE capabilities shall be transferred as
part of the Attach Request. AS UE capabilities shall be obtained by the eNodeB
using existing RRC procedures.
5\. If no UE context for the UE exists anywhere in the network, authentication
must be performed. If UE was unknown to the target MME and the old MME, target
MME will send an Identity Request to request the UE\'s IMSI prior to step 5.
PDN GW identity is sent from HSS to MME in this step. These messages are
tunnelled to/from the UE via the HRPD tunnelling mechanism and the S101 Direct
Transfer capability.
6\. If the MME has changed since the last detach, or if it is the very first
attach, the MME sends an Update Location to the HSS. The HSS acknowledges the
Update Location message by sending an Update Location Ack (IMSI, Subscription
data) message to the MME.
7\. The MME selects a Serving GW as described in TS 23.401 [4] and sends a
Create Session Request (Handover Indication) message to the selected Serving
GW. Since the Request Type is \"Handover\", a Handover Indication parameter is
included.
The Serving GW buffers any downlink packets it may receive from the PDN GW
without sending a Downlink Data Notification message to the MME until it
receives the Modify Bearer Request message.
8\. The Serving GW creates a new entry in its EPS Bearer table and sends a
Create Session Request message to the PDN GW.
9\. The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure
with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain any new QoS policy and
charging rules for all the active sessions as a result of the handover
procedure.
10\. The PDN GW returns a Create Session Response message to the Serving GW,
with the proper TEIDs and bearer-related information. After this step, the
path switch has occurred. The PDN GW may send a Create Bearer Request message
combined with the Create Session Response message, which starts the Dedicated
Bearer Activation Procedure.
11\. The Serving GW returns a Create Session Response message to the new MME.
The Create Bearer Request message may be sent together with the Create Session
Response message.
12\. Upon receiving the Create Session Response message, the MME sends an
Attach Accept message (and the Bearer Setup Request message if Create Bearer
Request message was received) to the UE over the S101 interface. S-TMSI is
included if the MME allocates a new S-TMSI. TAI List for the UE is included in
the Attach Accept message.
13\. The HRPD AN forwards the Attach Accept (and the Bearer Setup Request
message) to the UE.
14\. The UE sends the Attach Complete message (and the Bearer Setup Response
message) over the HRPD AN tunnelling mechanism.
15\. The HRPD AN forwards the Attach Complete message (and the Bearer Setup
Response message) to the MME.
16\. If Create Bearer Request message was sent by the Serving GW in step 11,
the MME sends a Create Bearer Response message to Serving GW.
17\. If Create Bearer Request message was sent by the PDN GW in step 10, the
Serving GW sends a Create Bearer Response message to PDN GW.
18\. Upon completion of the E-UTRAN Attach procedure, UE switches over to
EUTRAN.
NOTE 5: Messages 19‑24 are intended to be identical to the corresponding
messages for UE Initiated Service Request Procedures as described in TS 23.401
[4].
19\. UE performs the NAS service request procedure. The UE sends NAS message
Service Request towards the MME encapsulated in an RRC message to the eNodeB.
The RRC message(s) that can be used to carry this NAS message are described in
TS 36.300 [6]. The eNodeB forwards the NAS Service request message to MME. NAS
message is encapsulated in an S1-AP: Initial UE Message. Details of this step
are described in TS 36.300 [6].
20\. The MME sends S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request message to the eNodeB.
21\. The eNodeB performs the RRC radio bearer establishment procedure. The
user plane security is established at this step. This step implicitly confirms
the Service Request. This step is described in detail in TS 36.300 [6]. When
user plane security has been established the EPS bearer state is synchronized
between the UE and the network, i.e. the UE should remove any internal
resources for bearers that are not set up.
The uplink data from the UE can now be forwarded by eNodeB to the Serving GW.
The eNodeB sends the uplink data to the Serving GW address and TEID provided
in the step 20.
For connectivity to multiple PDNs the UE initiates re-establishment of the
additional PDN connections using the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure
described in clause 5.6.1.
22\. The eNodeB sends an S1-AP message Initial Context Setup Complete to the
MME. This step is described in detail in TS 36.300 [6].
23\. The MME sends a Modify Bearer Request message to the Serving GW. The
Serving GW is now able to transmit downlink data towards the UE.
24\. The Serving GW sends a Modify Bearer Response to the MME.
25\. MME sends HO complete to the HRPD AN, so that it can release resources.
26\. The HRPD resources may be released according to the 3GPP2 specific
release mechanism.
27\. At any time after step 9, the P‑GW shall initiate the Resource Allocation
Deactivation Procedure in HRPD network.
### 9.5.2 Using PMIP-based S5/S8
Figure 9.5.2-1 shows the steps that are different from the procedure for GTP
based S5/S8 (see clause 9.5.1).
{width="6.675694444444445in" height="3.470138888888889in"}
Figure 9.5.2-1: HRPD to EUTRAN handover with PMIP-based S5/S8
Steps before A.1 are described in clause 9.5.1.
A.1. The Serving GW initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules
required for the Serving GW to perform the bearer binding for all the active
sessions the UE may establish as a result of the handover procedure.
If the updated QoS rules require establishment of dedicated bearer for the UE,
the establishment of those bearers take place at step 11.
A.2. At same time of performing step 8, the Serving GW creates a new entry in
its EPS Bearer table and sends a Proxy Binding Request message to the PDN GW.
A.3. The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain the rules
required for the PDN GW to function as the PCEF for all the active IP sessions
the UE has established with new IP-CAN type.
A.4. The PDN Gateway returns a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. This message
includes the Charging ID for the PDN connection. After this step, the path
switch has occurred.
Steps after A.4 are described in clause 9.5.1, except that step 17 is not
performed.
## 9.6 Optimized Idle Mode Mobility: cdma2000 HRPD Access to E-UTRAN Access
This clause describes the optimized Idle Mode Handover from cdma2000 HRPD
Access to E-UTRAN Access. The UE pre-registers to the E-UTRAN network while in
the cdma2000 HRPD Access.
Figure 9.6.2-1: Optimized idle mode mobility from HRPD to E-UTRAN using GTP or
PMIP based S5/S8
1\. The UE is registered with HRPD and is in dormant mode.
2\. The UE decides to handover to E‑UTRAN network.
3\. UE becomes active in HRPD and sends Attach Request message to HRPD access
node carried on HRPD message X to trigger the attach procedure to E‑UTRAN.
4\. This attach procedure is same as the active mode handover procedure in
figure 9.5-1 steps 4‑17.
5\. The UE switches to E-UTRAN radio.
6\. The UE synchronises with the target cell and sends a TAU message to the
MME.
7\. The MME sends a Modify Bearer Request message to the Serving GW. If the
Serving GW receives any downlink data or it had already buffers any downlink
data, it is now able to send the Downlink Data notification to MME to trigger
paging procedure.
8\. The Serving GW acknowledges a Modify Bearer Response to the MME.
9\. The MME returns a TAU Accept message to the UE.
For connectivity to multiple PDNs the UE initiates re-establishment of the
additional PDN connections using the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure
described in clause 5.6.1.
10\. HRPD resources are released as applicable and defined in 3GPP2 X.S0057
[51], using the PDN GW initiated release procedure as defined in clause 6.12.1
as a trigger.
## 9.7 S101 Tunnel Redirection Procedure
S101 Tunnel Redirection Procedure is used when the UE performs TAU with MME
change while the UE has already triggered a pre-registration procedure from
LTE to the HRPD as described in clause 9.3.1 and the S101 session exists
between the MME and the HRPD Access Network.
The detail procedure for the idle case is depicted as figure 9.7-1.
Figure 9.7-1: S101 tunnel redirection during TAU with MME change
1\. UE performs pre-registration over the old MME while in ECM-CONNECTED
state, followed by transition to ECM-IDLE state. The S101 tunnel exists
between the old MME and the HRPD Access Network.
2\. TAU procedure with MME change is executed as described in TS 23.401 [4],
figure 5.3.3.1-1, up to the step where the new MME receives Update Location
Ack from the HSS. The HRPD Access Network IP address is transferred to the new
MME via the Context Response message.
3\. The new MME sends Notification Request (Redirection, S101 Session ID)
message to the HRPD Access Network. After receiving this message, the HRPD
Access Network associates the S101 tunnel for this specific UE with the new
MME. Then the HRPD Access Network releases any context associated with the old
MME.
4\. In response to the Notification Request message, the HRPD Access Network
sends a Notification Response (S101 Session ID) message to the target MME.
5\. The TAU procedure is completed.
The detailed procedure for the active case is depicted as figure 9.7-2.
Figure 9.7-2: S101 tunnel redirection during inter-eNodeB handover with MME
relocation
1\. UE performs pre-registration over the old MME while in ECM-CONNECTED
state. The S101 tunnel exists between the old MME and the HRPD Access Network.
2\. Inter-eNodeB handover with MME relocation procedure is executed as
described in TS 23.401 [4], figure 5.5.1.2.2-1, steps up to TAU. The HRPD
Access Network IP address is transferred to the new MME via the Forward
Relocation Request message.
3\. The new MME sends Notification Request (Redirection, S101 Session ID)
message to the HRPD Access Network. After receiving this message, the HRPD
Access Network associates the S101 tunnel with the new MME. Then the HRPD
Access Network releases any context associated with the old MME.
4\. In response to the Notification Request message, the HRPD Access Network
sends a Notification Response (S101 Session ID) message to the target MME.
5\. The TAU procedure occurs.
# 10 Handovers with Optimizations Between 3GPP Accesses and Mobile WiMAX
## 10.1 Optimizations for network-controlled dual radio handover
### 10.1.1 General Principles
The solution for network-controlled dual radio handover between 3GPP accesses
(GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN) and Mobile WiMAX is based on the concepts of clause
4.1.2 In addition, the following principles apply when the ANDSF functionality
is supported by the network and by the UE:
1) The EPS shall support mechanisms for delivery of inter-system mobility
policies and access network discovery information over the S14 interface, as
described in clause 4.8.
2) The inter-system mobility policies shall contain operator-defined rules and
preferences that help the UE:
(i) determine when mobility between mobile WiMAX and 3GPP accesses is
restricted or allowed; and
(ii) determine when a 3GPP or mobile WiMAX access is more preferable than the
currently used radio access.
3) The access network discovery information shall contain information about
mobile WiMAX access networks that are available in the vicinity of the UE, if
the UE\'s location is known and if such information is available in the
network and allowed by the operator.
4) If a UE discovers a neighbour mobile WiMAX access and determines (based on
the inter-system mobility policies and user preferences) that:
(i) the discovered mobile WiMAX access is more preferable to the currently
used 3GPP access; and
(ii) mobility from 3GPP access to mobile WiMAX access is allowed, then the UE
shall attempt to handover to the discovered mobile WiMAX access;
according to the S2a/S2c procedures described in clause 8.
5) If a UE discovers one or more neighbour 3GPP accesses and determines (based
on the inter-system mobility policies and user preferences) that:
(i) 3GPP access is more preferable to mobile WiMAX access; and
(ii) mobility from mobile WiMAX access to 3GPP access is allowed, then the UE
shall select a neighbour 3GPP access (e.g. based on 3GPP access selection
rules) and shall attempt to handover to the selected 3GPP access;
according to procedures described in clause 8.
# 11 Handover Optimizations Applicable to All Non-3GPP Accesses
\
# 12 Interactions Between HSS and AAA Server
## 12.0 General
The interaction between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS is not explicitly
presented in several figures of this specification. Though these entities are
depicted as \"AAA/HSS\" in these figures, these functions are distinct and
interact over the SWx reference point.
## 12.1 Location Management Procedures
The location management procedures between HSS and 3GPP AAA Server is
described in this clause.
Non-3GPP access location management procedures define the process in which the
3GPP AAA Server interacts with the HSS for the following purposes:
\- To register the current 3GPP AAA Server address in the HSS for a given 3GPP
user. This procedure is invoked by the 3GPP AAA Server after a new subscriber
has been authenticated by the 3GPP AAA Server (either at attach and handover).
As part of the response, the HSS returns the subscriber\'s user profile data
(QoS profile, user capabilities, etc.) to the 3GPP AAA Server.
\- To register the current PDN GW identity and its association with the UE and
APN in the HSS for a given user. This information is provided by the AAA
Server to the HSS at attachment to a particular PDN via non-3GPP access.
\- To acquire the PDN GW identity for each of the already allocated PDN
Gateway(s) with the corresponding PDN information from the HSS over the SWx
reference point for a given UE. This is for the case when the UE has already
been assigned PDN Gateway(s) due to a previous attach in a 3GPP access (when
the UE is handed over from a 3GPP access to a non-3GPP access).
\- To de-register the currently registered 3GPP AAA Server-address in the HSS
for a given user and purge any related non-3GPP user status data in the HSS.
The 3GPP AAA Server de-registers its address and purges user status data when
e.g. the UE has disappeared from non-3GPP access coverage, when another EPC
core network entity (e.g. charging system) has initiated a disconnection, when
a re-authentication failure in the 3GPP AAA Server occurs, etc. If a UE has
changed to a 3GPP access RAT, the 3GPP AAA Server initiated De-Registration
procedure should not affect any currently selected PDN GW identity and APN
associated with the UE\'s PDN Connection stored in the HSS and in use in the
3GPP access.
\- HSS-initiated de-registration procedure to purge the UE from the 3GPP AAA
server. This happens when the user\'s subscription has been cancelled or other
operator-determined reasons. As a result, the 3GPP AAA server should
deactivate any UE tunnel in the PDN GW and/or detach the UE from the access
network.
The previous procedures are described in more detail in the following clauses.
These procedures between the 3GPP AAA Server and the HSS are common to all
non-3GPP accesses, whether trusted or non-trusted, and are independent of the
mobility protocol used.
### 12.1.1 UE Registration Notification
After a UE has successfully been authenticated and authorised by the 3GPP AAA
Server to make use of a given non-3GPP access (over SWa/STa), ePDG (over SWm)
or PDN GW (over S6b for S2c), the 3GPP AAA Server registers its address to the
HSS, unless already done. In turn, the HSS should store the address of the
registered 3GPP AAA server for the given user and mark the user as registered
in the 3GPP AAA Server. In the response, the HSS returns user profile data.
{width="3.811111111111111in" height="1.6354166666666667in"}
Figure 12.1.1-1: UE Registration Notification
1\. Once the UE has been successfully authenticated by the 3GPP AAA server,
the 3GPP AAA Server sends a UE Registration Request (User Identity, 3GPP AAA
Server address) to the HSS.
2\. The HSS checks that the user is known and that the stored 3GPP AAA Server
address is the same one stored for the user and that it is the same 3GPP AAA
Server that previously requested authentication vectors for this same user. If
this is successful, the HSS marks the 3GPP AAA Server as the registered 3GPP
AAA Server for user. The HSS responds with a UE Registration Ack (User
Identity, Subscription Data). The subscription data includes information to be
used by the PDN GW selection function or an already selected PDN GW identity
and APN if present.
### 12.1.2 AAA-initiated UE De-registration Notification
The 3GPP AAA Server requests the HSS to De-Register the currently registered
UE. In doing so, the 3GPP AAA Server is notifying the HSS that the UE no
longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server. The HSS should in turn delete
the registered 3GPP AAA Server address.
{width="3.8020833333333335in" height="1.5833333333333333in"}
Figure 12.1.2-1: AAA-initiated UE De-registration Notification
1\. The 3GPP AAA Server sends a UE De-Registration Request (User Identity,
Cause) to the HSS. The \"Cause\" field may take values such as Authentication-
Failure, UE-Detached, Charging-System-Request, etc.
2\. The HSS marks the UE as not-registered, removes the 3GPP AAA Server
address previously stored for the UE and responds with a UE De-Registration
Ack.
### 12.1.3 HSS-initiated UE De-registration Notification
The HSS requests the 3GPP AAA Server to de-register a UE, for instance, when a
subscription is withdrawn or other operator determined reasons. The 3GPP AAA
Server should purge user data, set the user to not-registered and detach the
UE and/or deactivate any network resources allocated to the user.
{width="3.854861111111111in" height="1.604861111111111in"}
Figure 12.1.3-1: HSS-initiated UE De-registration Notification
1\. The HSS server sends a UE De-Registration Request (User Identity, Cause)
to the 3GPP AAA Server. The \"Cause\" field may take values such as
Subscription Withdrawn, Administrative-Reason, etc.
2\. The 3GPP AAA Server marks the user as not-registered and purges any user
data. It responds with a UE De-Registration Ack. In addition, the 3GPP AAA
Server should initiate detach of the UE or de-activation of any network
resources.
### 12.1.4 PDN GW Identity Notification from AAA Server
The 3GPP AAA Server updates the HSS with the PDN GW identity of the selected
PDN GW and the APN associated with the UE\'s PDN Connection. This procedure
only occurs when the 3GPP AAA Server has in turn successfully received the PDN
GW identity and APN from the PDN GW the UE is attached to. The 3GPP AAA server
should subsequently always update the HSS with the PDN GW identity in the
above-mentioned manner. This procedure is used for PDN GW registration.
Figure 12.1.4-1: PDN GW Address Notification
1\. The 3GPP AAA Server sends a Update PDN GW Identity Request (PDN GW
Identity, APN, User Identity) to the HSS.
The PDN GW identity is either the IP address (e.g. if the PDN GW has a single
IP address for all the mobility protocols it supports or if it only supports
one mobility protocol) or the FQDN (e.g. if the PDN GW has multiple IP
addresses for the mobility protocols it supports).
2\. The HSS checks that the user is known and that the stored 3GPP AAA Server
name is the currently registered 3GPP AAA server for this same user. If this
is successful, the HSS returns a Update PDN GW Identity Acknowledgement.
3\. Steps 3-4 are only performed if the PDN GW identity information was
successfully modified in the HSS and an SGSN or MME is registered in the HSS
for the same UE. In this case the HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data message
to the SGSN or MME to update the change in the SGSN or MME. If both an SGSN
and an MME is registered in the HSS, and Insert Subscriber Data message is
sent to each of them.
4\. The SGSN or MME acknowledges by sending an Insert Subscriber Data Ack
message.
### 12.1.5 PDN GW Identity Notification from MME/SGSN
In case of initial attach, or UE requested PDN connectivity, in the 3GPP
access, the SGSN/MME updates the HSS with the PDN GW identity of the selected
PDN GW and the APN associated with the UE\'s PDN connection. If a 3GPP AAA
Server is registered in the HSS for the same UE, the HSS provides the updated
APN and PDN GW identity information to the 3GPP AAA Server. If NBM is used for
establishing connectivity in the non-3GPP access, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the changes to the non-3GPP access network. This procedure is used for PDN GW
registration.
Figure 12.1.5-1: PDN GW address notification from SGSN/MME
1\. The SGSN/MME sends a Notify Request (PDN GW Identity, APN, User Identity)
to the HSS.
2\. The HSS checks that the user is known and that the stored SGSN/MME is the
currently registered SGSN/MME for this same user. If this is successful, the
HSS returns a Notify Response.
3\. Steps 3-4 are only performed if the PDN GW identity information was
successfully modified in the HSS and a 3GPP AAA Server is registered in the
HSS for the same UE. In this case the HSS sends Update APN and PDN GW Identity
Request message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
4\. The 3GPP AAA Server acknowledges by sending a Update APN and PDN GW
Identity Ack message.
5\. If NBM is used for establishing connectivity in the non-3GPP IP access,
the 3GPP AAA Server updates the ePDG/trusted non-3GPP IP access network with
the new APN and PGW Identity data by sending Update APN and PDN GW Identity
message.
6\. The ePDG/trusted non-3GPP IP access network acknowledges by sending Update
APN and PDN GW Identity Ack message.
## 12.2 Subscriber Profile Management Procedures
The subscriber profile management procedures between HSS and 3GPP AAA Server
is described in this clause.
The procedure is invoked by the HSS when the subscriber profile has been
modified and needs to be sent to the 3GPP AAA Server. This may happen due to a
modification of user profile data in the HSS.
The 3GPP AAA Server may also request the user profile data from the HSS. This
procedure is invoked when for some reason the subscription profile of a
subscriber is lost or needs to be updated.
### 12.2.1 HSS-initiated User Profile Update Procedure
The HSS may send a User Profile Update request to the 3GPP AAA Server whenever
the subscriber profile in the HSS is modified since it was previously sent to
the 3GPP AAA Server. The User Profile Update procedure is depicted in the
following figure.
{width="3.8229166666666665in" height="1.542361111111111in"}
Figure 12.2.1-1: HSS-initiated User Profile Update Procedure
1\. The HSS sends a User Profile Update (User Identity, Subscription Data)
message to the 3GPP AAA Server. If the HSS is aware of the non-3GPP access
type it may return only the subscription data that affects the non-3GPP
access.
2\. The 3GPP AAA Server updates its subscription data and acknowledges the
User Profile Update message by returning a User Profile Update Ack (User
Identity) message. As a result, the 3GPP AAA Server may need to update the
non-3GPP access network and the PDN GW with new authorisation data, new
service authorisation data and new subscribed QoS data.
### 12.2.2 AAA-initiated Provide User Profile Procedure
The 3GPP AAA Server may send a Provide User Profile request to the HSS when
the user subscription profile of a subscriber is lost or is corrupt or for any
other reason.
{width="3.823611111111111in" height="1.9993055555555554in"}
Figure 12.2.2-1: AAA-initiated Provide User Profile Procedure
1\. The 3GPP AAA Server sends a Provide User Profile (User Identity) to the
HSS.
2\. The HSS checks that the user is known and that the stored 3GPP AAA Server
address is the same one stored for the user and that it is the same server
that previously requested authentication of the same user. If this is
successful, the HSS returns a Provide User Profile Ack (user identity,
subscription data). If the HSS is aware of the non-3GPP access type it may
return only the subscription data that affects the non-3GPP access.
## 12.3 Authentication Procedures
The authentication procedures between HSS and 3GPP AAA Server are described in
TS 33.402 [45].
The authentication procedures define the process in which the 3GPP AAA Server
interacts with the HSS to acquire necessary data (i.e. Authentication Vectors
for EAP‑AKA or EAP-AKA**\'**) from the HSS to successfully authenticate the
user for accessing the non-3GPP system.
# 13 Information Storage
## 13.0 General
This clause describes the additional information stored in different nodes
while the UE is in non-3GPP access.
The information provided in clauses 13.1, 13.2 and 13.3 is incomplete in this
Release of the specification and intended only for information. Detailed
information is available in corresponding stage 3 specifications.
## 13.1 HSS
The data held in the HSS when non 3GPP accesses are not used is defined in TS
23.401 [4].
The additional data held in the HSS when non 3GPP accesses are used is defined
in table 13.1-1 below.
Table 13.1-1: HSS EPS Data (additional aspects for non 3GPP accesses)
* * *
Field Description 3GPP AAA Server name The Identity of the 3GPP AAA Server
serving the UE currently. QoS profile per access The quality of service
profile subscribed for a particular access for a specific APN ODB Indicates

Access Restriction Indicates the access restriction subscription information.
* * *
## 13.2 MME
Information storage for the MME is described in TS 23.401 [4]. The additional
data held in the MME when optimized interworking with CDMA2000 HRPD is used is
defined in table 13.2‑1 below.

connection. This is stored on a per PDN connection basis.
* * *
## 13.3 S‑GW
Information storage for the S‑GW is described in TS 23.401 [4]. The additional
data held in the S‑GW when optimized interworking with CDMA2000 HRPD is used
is defined in table 13.3‑1 below.

Field Description S103 Forwarding Address HS‑GW IP address used for data
forwarding to the HRPD access over S103 interface. This is stored on a per UE
basis. S103 GRE key(s) GRE Key(s) used for the data forwarding tunnel to the
HS‑GW - one per PDN connection. This is stored on a per PDN connection basis.
* * *
## 13.4 Handling of Wild Card APN
When the wild card APN is present in the subscription context, the UE is
authorized to connect to APNs which are not present in the subscription
context.
When a request is received for registering a PDN GW ID for such an active APN
which is not present in the subscription context, the nodes (HSS/MME/ S4
SGSN/AAA Server/Non-3GPP access) shall store the PDN GW ID and the APN for the
UE.
When a request is received for deregistering of PDN GW ID, for such an active
APN which is not present in the subscription context, the nodes (HSS/MME/ S4
SGSN/AAA Server/Non-3GPP access) shall delete the PDN GW ID and the APN for
the UE.
# 14 Void
# 15 Functional Description and Procedures for 3GPP Accesses with S2c
## 15.1 S2c Bootstrapping via DSMIPv6 Home Link
When connected over the UE home link (i.e. 3GPP access as defined in clause
4.1), the UE may trigger the establishment of S2c IKEv2 SA, e.g. to optimize
future handovers to non-3GPP accesses using S2c. For each PDN connection, the
S2c IKEv2 SA establishment has to be performed separately.
{width="6.522222222222222in" height="4.159722222222222in"}
Figure 15.1-1: S2c PDN Attach via DSMIPv6 home link
0\. In this procedure it is assumed that UE is already attached to the PDN
over the 3GPP access system as defined in TS 23.401 [4]. This step, according
to TS 23.401 [4] could be an initial attach to a default PDN or a UE initiated
subsequent attach to another PDN.
1\. The UE discovers the PDN GW providing access to the PDN it connected to in
Step 0, as defined in the clause 4.5.2. To ensure reachability of the PDN GW,
signalling associated with this step as well as step 2 below, should be
performed over the connection established by step 0 above.
2\. A security association is established between the UE and PDN GW to secure
the DSMIPv6 messages related to this PDN connection between the UE and the PDN
GW.
The UE initiates the establishment of the security association using IKEv2
[9]; EAP [11] is used over IKEv2 for authentication purposes. The PDN GW
communicates with the AAA infrastructure in order to complete the
authentication.
During this step an IPv6 home prefix is assigned by the PDN GW to the UE as
defined in RFC 4877 [22]. During this step the UE shall include the IPv6 Home
Address and may include the APN of the PDN it wants to access. The PDN GW
address and APN associated with the UE\'s PDN Connectivity are registered by
the AAA server with the HSS as described in clause 12.
In this step, the PDN GW may be either in the HPLMN or in the VPLMN. When the
PDN GW is in the VPLMN, the interaction between the PDN GW in the VPLMN with
the AAA/HSS in the HPLMN may involve a 3GPP AAA Proxy in the VPLMN as
specified in TS 23.234 [5].
3\. UE confirms that it is located in its DSMIPv6 home link for the given PDN,
as described for DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function in clause 4.5.6.
In some cases this procedure may result in a PDN GW that is different than the
one the UE is connected to in step 0. In this case the PDN GW reallocation
procedure defined in clause 6.10 is applied.
# 16 Architecture, Functional description and Procedures for GTP and PMIPv6
based S2a over Trusted WLAN Access
## 16.1 Architecture and Functional Description
### 16.1.1 Architecture
When the WLAN is considered as trusted by the operator, the Trusted WLAN
Access Network (TWAN) is interfaced with the EPC as a trusted non-3GPP access
via the STa interface to the 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy and the S2a interface to
the PDN GW.
Figure 16.1.1-1: Non-roaming architecture for Trusted WLAN access to EPC
Figure 16.1.1-2: Roaming architecture for Trusted WLAN access to EPC - Home
Routed
Figure 16.1.1-3: Roaming architecture for Trusted WLAN access to EPC - Local
break-out
### 16.1.2 High level functions
The detailed functional split within a Trusted WLAN Access Network (TWAN) is
not in the scope of 3GPP. Nevertheless, the procedures specified in the
subsequent sections assume the following functions in the TWAN:
\- A WLAN Access Network (WLAN AN). WLAN AN includes a collection of one or
more WLAN access points. An access point terminates the UE\'s WLAN IEEE 802.11
link defined in IEEE Std 802.11-2007 [64].
\- A Trusted WLAN Access Gateway (TWAG). This function terminates S2a. It also
acts as the default router for the UE on its access link, and as a DHCP server
for the UE. When the TWAN provides access to EPC for an UE, it forwards
packets between the UE-TWAG point-to-point link and the S2a tunnel for that
UE. The association in the TWAN between UE-TWAG point-to-point link and S2a
tunnel is based on the UE MAC address.
\- A Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy (TWAP). This function terminates STa. It relays
the AAA information between the WLAN Access Network and the 3GPP AAA Server or
Proxy in case of roaming. It establishes the binding of UE subscription data
(including IMSI) with UE MAC address on the WLAN Access Network. If L2 attach
triggers are used, it informs the TWAG of L2 attach events. It is aware of UE
L2 Detach from the WLAN Access Network and informs the TWAG of L2 Detach
events. It provides the TWAG with UE subscription data during initial attach
or at UE subscription data modification.
Figure 16.1.2-1: Trusted WLAN Access Network functional split
A per-UE point-to-point link between the UE and the TWAG is required when
traffic for that UE is routed via S2a. In particular,it is assumed that the
WLAN AN enforces upstream and downstream forced-forwarding between the UE\'s
WLAN IEEE 802.11 association and the TWAG. The aspects of point-to-point link
described in RFC 5213 [8] and RFC 5844 [17] also apply to the point-to-point
link between UE and TWAG. The implementation of the point-to-point link,
including how and when it is setup, is out-of-scope of 3GPP.
NOTE 1: From the UE\'s perspective the SWw reference point appears as a shared
medium / link as any other IEEE 802.11 WLAN and thus the UE can use the subnet
prefix / mask and the default GW address for its packet routing decisions. The
point-to-point nature of the link is realized by the TWAN enforcing that
packets sent from, and received by the UE are respectively forwarded to, and
forwarded by the TWAG.
NOTE 2: Gxa interface is not used for S2a-PMIP in Trusted WLAN within this
Release of the specification. No policy interworking solution based on S9a is
defined for Fixed Broadband access interworking via S2a within this Release of
the specification.
NOTE 3： Whether multiple TWAN functions are mapped to a single entity, or a
single TWAN function is distributed among multiple entities is out-of-scope of
3GPP.
In order to support EPC access through S2a over Trusted WLAN the following
functions shall be supported by the UE:
\- WLAN specifications as per IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 [64].
\- 3GPP-based network access authentication with EPC over WLAN as defined in
clause 4.9.1, using IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 [65].
\- IPv4 and/or IPv6 support:
\- For IPv4: IETF RFC 791 [66], IETF RFC 2131 [28]
\- For IPv6: IETF RFC 2460 [67], IETF RFC 4861 [38], and IETF RFC 4862 [58]
In this Release of the specification, handover-indicator from the UE, APN
indication from the UE and PCO via WLAN are not specified. As a consequence,
for EPC access through S2a over Trusted WLAN the following features are not
supported in this Release of the specification: Handover between TWAN and 3GPP
access with IP address preservation; Connectivity to a non-default APN (as not
signalled by the UE); UE initiated connectivity to additional PDN.
A single SSID offering for a given UE simultaneous access to EPC through S2a
and non-seamless offload is not supported.
### 16.1.3 Reference points
#### 16.1.3.1 STa reference point
In addition to STa reference point features specified for any non-3GPP IP
access network, STa reference point specification is enhanced with the
following features for the support of EPC access through S2a over Trusted
WLAN:
\- A way for the TWAN to provide the 3GPP AAA server with following
information:
\- An indication on whether the TWAN supports S2a, non-seamless offload or
both;
\- The SSID selected by the UE to access the TWAN.
\- A way for the 3GPP AAA server to provide the TWAN with following
information:
\- Whether access to EPC is allowed for the UE on the TWAN;
\- As for any Trusted Non-3GPP Access, when the UE is allowed to access EPC
via TWAN, the default APN to be associated with the user for EPC access; the
TWAN uses it to establish the PDN connection with the PDN GW in the absence of
UE signalling of the APN it desires to reach over the Trusted WLAN. Based on
the HPLMN operator configuration the HSS may provide the 3GPP AAA server with
a default APN different from the 3GPP access default APN;
\- The subscriber MSISDN.
#### 16.1.3.2 SWw reference point
The SWw reference point connects the WLAN UE to the WLAN Access Network per
IEEE Std 802.11-2007 [64]. The definition of IEEE Physical and Medium Access
Control layers protocols (e.g. Layer 1 and Layer 2 defined by IEEE Std
802.11-2007 [64]) is out of the scope of 3GPP.
#### 16.1.3.3 S2a reference point
The S2a reference point connects the TWAN to the PDN GW. It supports two
possible protocol variants: GTP and PMIPv6, to be chosen by the TWAN.
### 16.1.4 Protocol Stacks
The following protocols are supported on S2a:
\- GTP.
\- PMIPv6.
The link model between the UE and the TWAN as well as IPv4 address and IPv6
prefix allocation considerations are equally valid for GTP and PMIPv6 S2a
options.
The figure below illustrates the control plane for Tunnel Management and the
user plane for GTP option.
**Legend:**
**802.11:** This refers to Layer 1 and Layer 2 defined by IEEE Std 802.11-2007
[64]. Layer 2 of 802.11 is used as L2 attach and detach triggers. L2 attach
trigger is mandatory with IPv6 and IPv4v6 PDN Types, and optional for IPv4 PDN
Type.
**L3 trigger:** This refers to DHCPv4 which can be used as optional L3 attach
trigger with IPv4 PDN Type.
**GTP-C:** The GPRS Tunnelling Protocol control plane consists of signalling
messages between the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway and the PDN- GW over the S2a
interface. It is defined in TS 29.274 [57].
**GTP-U:** The GPRS Tunnelling Protocol user plane tunnels user data between
the Trusted WLAN Access Gateway and the PDN GW over the S2a interface. It is
defined in TS 29.281 [63].
**UDP:** This is the transport layer protocol onto which both GTP-C and GTP-U
are layered.
**IPv4/IPv6:** This refers to network layer protocols. On the TWAN this
includes termination of the UE-TWAN link-local protocols (e.g. IPv6 Neighbor
Discovery, ARP) and forwarding of user plane IP packets between the UE-TWAN
point-to-point link and the S2a tunnel for the UE.
Figure 16.1.4-1: Protocols for control and user planes of GTP-based S2a
When PMIP based S2a is used with Trusted WLAN, the PMIPv6 protocol stacks
described in clause 6.1.1 apply.
### 16.1.5 IP address allocation
As it is specified in clause 4.7.2 the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is
allocated to the UE when a new PDN connection is established.
In this Release of the specification, deferred IPv4 address allocation is not
supported. Therefore in order to enable IPv4 connectivity the TWAN shall
support DHCPv4 server functionality for IPv4 parameter configuration and IP
address allocation as specified in RFC 2131 [28] and RFC 4039 [29]. For this
case the following applies:
\- If the PDN type in the user subscribtion data is IPv4 or IPv4v6, the TWAN
requests IPv4 address in the Proxy Binding Update or GTP Create Session
Request from the PDN GW. The IPv4 address is delivered to the TWAN during the
PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel establishement. When the UE requests the IPv4 address via
DHCPv4, the TWAN delivers the received IPv4 address to the UE within DHCPv4
signalling after the PMIPv6 or GTP tunnel is established between the TWAN and
the PDN GW.
NOTE 1: As a consequence the PDN GW configuration for the default APN used via
Trusted WLAN access cannot dictate the use of deferred IPv4 address
allocation.
NOTE 2: After releasing the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 Release procedure, the
UE may subsequently request an IPv4 address for the same PDN connection. If
the PDN connection is not released at this point of time, a subsequent IPv4
address request by the UE will result in the allocation of the same IP
address, as the IPv4 address assigned to the UE has not been released in the
PDN GW and TWAN.
In order to enable IPv6 the TWAN shall support of prefix advertisement for
IPv6 prefix received from PDN GW in PMIPv6 Proxy Binding Acknowledgement or in
the GTP Create Session Response. Moreover the TWAN may support DHCPv6 server
functionality for IPv6 parameter configuration as specified in RFC 3736 [30].
This functionality is required to support DHCPv6 based parameter configuration
mechanism in the UE. The TWAN may also support IPv6 RA options for DNS
configuration accorduing to RFC 6106 [68].
NOTE 3: Configuration parameters are received from the PDN GW within PMIPv6
PBA message or within GTP Create Session Response message.
After the PDN GW releases the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix, the PDN GW
should not assign the same IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix to another UE
immediately.
In case of static IP address allocation, the TWAN may receive a static IP
address (i.e. a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix) from HSS/AAA
during access authentication and authorization procedure. Then the TWAN should
forward the static IP address to the PDN GW during the tunnel establishment
request (in PBU or in Create Session Request message).
### 16.1.6 Bearer model for PDN connectivity service with GTP based S2a
Figure 16.1.6-1: Two Unicast S2a bearers (GTP based S2a)
For Trusted WLAN access to the EPC, the PDN connectivity service is provided
by the point-to-point connectivity between the UE and the TWAG concatenated
with S2a bearer(s) between the TWAG and the PDN GW.
The bearer model of GTP based S2a interface is similar to that of GTP based
S5/S8 interface and GTP based S2b interface. The TWAN handles the uplink
packets based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs received from the PDN
GW for the S2a bearers of the PDN connection, in the same way as an ePDG does
for GTP based S2b interface.
## 16.2 Initial Attach in WLAN on S2a
### 16.2.1 Initial Attach in WLAN on GTP S2a
Figure 16.2.1-1: Initial attachment in WLAN on GTP S2a for roaming, LBO and
non-roaming scenarios
The home routed roaming, LBO and non-roaming scenarios are depicted in the
figure 16.2.1-1:
\- In the LBO case, the 3GPP AAA Proxy acts as an intermediary, forwarding
messages from the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN to the PDN GW in the VPLMN and
vice versa. Messages between the PDN GW in the VPLMN and the hPCRF in the
HPLMN are forwarded by the vPCRF in the VPLMN.
\- In the home routed roaming and non-roaming cases, the vPCRF and the 3GPP
AAA Proxy are not involved, except for the authentication and authorization in
step 2.
Either scenario (A) or scenario (B) is performed:
\- Scenario (A) is defined as the TWAP sending the layer 2 attach trigger to
the TWAG. This is done at successful EAP authentication (step 2). Completion
of EAP authentication with the TWAP informing the UE of EAP success is
deferred until step 8 after the tunnel was established (steps 3-7). The attach
trigger signal sent from TWAP to TWAG includes MAC address and subscription
data (including IMSI) of the UE. Steps 10-14 are omitted in scenario (A).
Scenario (A) is applicable for all existing PDN Types (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6) and
is the recommended way.
\- Scenario (B) is defined as the TWAG using the layer 3 attach request (i.e.
a DHCPv4 message) sent by the UE as the attach trigger. In this scenario steps
3-7 are omitted. Step 9 triggers the TWAG to establish the tunnel (steps
10-14). Between step 2 and step 10, the TWAG obtains subscription data
(including IMSI) for the UE from the TWAP, based on the MAC address of the UE.
How this is performed is out-of-scope for 3GPP. Scenario (B) is only
applicable for PDN Type IPv4.
The steps below only refer to TWAN, not to specific functions internal to TWAN
(i.e. TWAG, TWAP and WLAN AN).
1\. The initial TWAN specific L2 procedures are performed. These procedures
are TWAN specific and are outside the scope of 3GPP.
2\. The EAP authentication procedure is initiated and performed involving the
UE, the TWAN and the 3GPP AAA Server. In the roaming case, there may be
several AAA proxies involved. Subscription data is provided to the TWAN by the
HSS/AAA in this step. The list of all the authorized APNs, including
additional PDN GW selection information is returned to the TWAN as part of the
reply from the 3GPP AAA Server to the TWAN as described in clause 4.5.1. The
Subscription data may also include a default APN for WLAN that is different
from the default APN for other accesses. The 3GPP AAA Server also returns to
the TWAN the User Identity to be used to identify the UE in the Create Session
Request (step 3 or 10).
NOTE 1: It is recommended that the default APN for TWAN is different from any
APN that the UE may use on the 3GPP side. Nevertheless, for an UE the default
APN for TWAN may be used on other access technologies. In that case:
\- The network may select a single or different PDN GWs for PDN connections to
this APN that are active at the same time via the 3GPP access network and the
TWAN. If a single PDN GW is selected then the APN-AMBR is enforced for all PDN
connections for that APN. If different PDN GWs are selected then the APN-AMBR
is enforced separately in the respective PDN GW for the PDN connection, i.e.
the UE will receive double amount of bandwidth for the APN.
\- The PDN GW identity provided by the 3GPP AAA server to HSS as part of the
Initial Attach on TWAN may be different from and overwrite the PDN GW identity
provided, for the same APN, by the MME/SGSN or by another PDN GW. Therefore,
to avoid interfering with the PDN Connections over 3GPP access, the HSS should
not be updated with the selected PDN GW identity for Trusted WLAN access. The
3GPP AAA Server could be configured to not provide the PDN GW identity
selected as part of the Initial Attach on TWAN to HSS. This applies to step 5
and step 12 of this procedure. Depending on operator deployment there may also
be proprietary means in the HPLMN to ensure that the HSS is not updated with
the selected PDN GW identity for Trusted WLAN access.
\- The PDN GW identity provided by the MME/SGSN to HSS as part of the Initial
Attach on 3GPP may be different from the PDN GW identity selected for the same
APN by the TWAN. As there is no mobility support in this Release of the
specification, no action from the TWAN is expected when the TWAN is updated
with the selected PDN GW identity for 3GPP access.
\- PMIP-based S5/S8 with dynamic PCC can not be deployed since it will result
in wrong session linking between Gateway Control Session and Gx session in the
PCRF.
IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 [65] is used over the WLAN air link to carry EAP as
defined by IEEE Std 802.11-2007 [64].
The TWAN may provide to the 3GPP AAA server via STa the SSID selected by the
UE to access the TWAN and an indication whether it supports S2a, non-seamless
offload, or both. The HSS/AAA may indicate via STa whether access to EPC via
S2a or the use of NSWO or both are allowed for this subscriber. The HSS/AAA
decision to allow EPC access or NSWO or both could be based on information
elements such as subscriber profile, access network, and/or SSID selected.
NOTE 2: The authorization of both NSWO and EPC routed traffic by the 3GPP AAA
is only applicable in non-roaming scenarios.
The TWAN determines based on HSS/AAA indication or pre-configured information
whether or not to establish S2a. If the TWAN determined that S2a shall not be
used steps 3-7 and 10-14 are skipped. Instead, if it is authorized, the TWAN
performs NSWO for the subscriber.
The following steps 3-7 are only performed in scenario (A):
3\. The TWAN selects the S2a protocol variant (either GTP or PMIP; GTP in this
case). The TWAN may be configured with the S2a protocol variant(s) on a per
HPLMN granularity, or may retrieve information regarding the S2a protocol
variants supported by the PDN GW (PMIP or/and GTP) from the Domain Name
Service function.
The TWAN selects the PGW as per the PGW selection procedure in clause 4.5.1;
if the TWAN receives a PGW Identity under the form of a FQDN, it shall derive
from the FQDN an IP address of a PGW for the selected mobility management
protocol (GTP in this case).
NOTE 3 As for existing principles, to support separate PDN GW addresses at a
PDN GW for different mobility protocols (e.g. PMIP or GTPv2), when deriving a
PDN GW address with the Domain Name Service function, the PDN GW Selection
function takes into account the mobility protocol type.
The TWAN selects default APN according the subscription data received in step
2. The TWAN sends a Create Session Request (IMSI, APN, RAT type, TWAN TEID of
the control plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, Default EPS
Bearer QoS, TWAN Address for the user plane, TWAN TEID of the user plane, APN-
AMBR, Selection Mode, Dual Address Bearer Flag, Trace Information, Charging
Characteristics, Serving Network, Additional parameters) message to the PDN
GW. The RAT type indicates the non-3GPP IP access technology type. The PDN
Type shall be set based on the result of step 2. The TWAN shall set the Dual
Address Bearer Flag when the PDN type is set to IPv4v6. The TWAN shall include
Trace Information if PDN GW trace is activated. The Serving Network parameter
identifies the selected PLMN used for 3GPP-based access authentication i.e.
the VPLMN in roaming case, and the HPLMN in non-roaming case. Additionally, if
location information is sent, Create Session Request should include the BSSID
(see IEEE Std 802.11-2007 [64]) and shall include the SSID of the access point
to which the UE is attached.
NOTE 4: In this Release of the specification, the PDN GW does not receive the
TWAN operator identity.
The PDN GW creates a new entry in its bearer context table and generates a
Charging Id. The new entry allows the PDN GW to route user plane PDUs between
the TWAN and the packet data network and to start charging.
NOTE 5: The EPS Bearer Identity and Default EPS Bearer QoS parameters convey
the S2a bearer identity and the default S2a bearer QoS.
4\. The PDN GW initiates the IP‑CAN Session Establishment Procedure with the
PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The PDN GW provides information to the
PCRF used to identify the session. The PCRF creates IP‑CAN session related
information and responds to the PDN GW with PCC rules and event triggers. The
PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and send the APN-AMBR to the PDN GW in the
response message.
5\. The selected PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of its PDN GW identity and
the APN corresponding to the UE\'s PDN Connection. The message includes
information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN GW is located. This
information is registered in the HSS as described in clause 12.
When informing the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN GW identity, the selected PDN GW
also indicates the selected S2a protocol variant (GTP in this case); this
allows the option for the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy not to return to
the PDN GW PMIP specific parameters (e.g. static QoS Profile, Trace
Information, APN-AMBR) if GTP is used over S2a; the PDN GW shall ignore those
parameters if received from the 3GPP AAA Server or 3GPP AAA Proxy.
6\. The PDN GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the user
plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control plane, PDN
Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR, Additional
parameters, Cause) message to the TWAN, including the IP address(es) allocated
for the UE.
The PDN GW may initiate the creation of dedicated bearers on GTP based S2a (as
it does on GTP based S5/S8 for an Attach on 3GPP access).
7\. The GTP tunnel is set up between the TWAN and the PDN GW.
8\. TWAN sends EAP success to the UE thus completing EAP authentication.
After EAP authentication, UE traffic over the WLAN air link may be
confidentiality and integrity protected as defined by IEEE Std 802.11-2007
[64].
NOTE 6: It is implementation dependent if step 8 is performed before, after or
in parallel to steps 3-7.
9\. The UE may send layer 3 attach request, (e.g. a DHCPv4 request as per IETF
RFC 2131 [28]).
NOTE 7: The UE may send IPv6 Router Solicitation at any time after step 8.
NOTE 8: It is assumed that, to identify the UE, the L3 attach request is
transported in an L2 frame that contains the UE L2 address (MAC address).
10-14. These steps are equal to step 3-7.
NOTE 9: These steps are only performed for scenario (B), which is only
possible when the PDN type is IPv4 and a DHCPv4 request was sent in step 9.
15\. A DHCPv4 message with allocated IPv4 address and/or Router Advertisement
with IPv6 prefix is sent to the UE. The UE may perform additional IP layer
configuration with the TWAN as per standard IETF procedures, e.g. IPv6
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration as per IETF RFC 4862 [58], and Stateless
DHCPv6 as per IETF RFC 3736 [30].
NOTE 10: A UE might request to get some IP configuration parameters (e.g. DNS
server) by means of DHCP. These parameters sent by TWAN (acting as a DHCP
server) to the UE in a DHCP reply. These parameters are retrieved by the TWAN
from the PGW within Create Session Response.
NOTE 11: For scenario (A), after step 8, the TWAN may send unsolicited IP
layer configuration signalling, e.g. RA, over the point-to-point link towards
the UE.
### 16.2.2 Initial Attach in WLAN on PMIP S2a
Figure 16.2.2-1: Initial attachment in WLAN on PMIP S2a for roaming, LBO and
non-roaming scenarios
This procedure is based on clause 16.2.1 with the following key differences:
\- In step 3 and 10 the TWAN selects S2a protocol variant, PMIPv6. The TWAN
sends a Proxy Binding Update message. The details of the Proxy Binding Update
message are described in step 5 in clause 6.2.1. Additionally if location
information is sent, Proxy Binding Update should include the BSSID (see IEEE
Std 802.11-2007 [64]) and shall include the SSID of the access point to which
the UE is attached.
\- Step 5 and 12 is the same as described in step 7 in clause 6.2.1, except
that the Proxy Binding Update message shall contain the Serving Network
parameter, which identifies the selected PLMN used for 3GPP-based access
authentication i.e. the VPLMN in roaming case, and the HPLMN in non-roaming
case.
\- In step 6 and 13 the PDN GW sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.
The details of the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message are described in step
8 in clause 6.2.1.
\- In step 7 and 14 the established tunnel between the TWAN and PDN GW is a
PMIPv6 tunnel.
NOTE 1: A UE might request to get some IP configuration parameters (e.g. DNS
server) by means of DHCP. These parameters sent by TWAN (acting as a DHCP
server) to the UE in a DHCP reply. These parameters are retrieved by the TWAN
from the PDN GW within Proxy Binding Ack.
NOTE 2: In this Release of the specification, the PDN GW does not receive the
TWAN operator identity.
## 16.3 Detach and PDN disconnection in WLAN on S2a
### 16.3.1 Detach and PDN disconnection in WLAN on GTP S2a
#### 16.3.1.1 UE/TWAN Initiated Detach and UE/TWAN requested PDN Disconnection
Procedure in WLAN on GTP S2a
Figure 16.3.1.1-1: UE/TWAN Initiated Detach and UE/TWAN requested PDN
Disconnection on GTP S2a
The procedure for UE/ TWAN Initiated Detach is represented in Figure
16.3.1.1-1 and described below.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local
Breakout cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages
between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Home Routed Roaming and LBO cases,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming and Home
Routed Roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.
If dynamic policy provisioning is not deployed, the optional steps of
interaction between the PDN GW and PCRF do not occur. Instead, the PDN GW may
employ static configured policies.
1) To detach from EPC, the UE can send a disassociation or deauthentication
notification according to\ IEEE Std 802.11-2007 [64]. Any time after the UE
releases the IPv4 address using DHCPv4 or IPv4 address lease time expires, and
if the PDN Type is IPv4, the TWAN initiates \"TWAN initiated PDN Disconnection
Procedure\" procedure. If there is no traffic received from the UE for a
configurable duration and the TWAN detects the UE has left based on unanswered
probes (e.g., ARP Request, Neighbor Solicitation message), the TWAN triggers
PDN disconnection.
2) The TWAN releases the PDN connection by sending a Delete Session Request
(Linked EPS Bearer ID) message for the PDN connection to the PDN GW.
3) The PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the PDN disconnection. If the UE
no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies
the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2.
4) The PDN GW deletes the IP‑CAN session associated with the UE and executes a
PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified
in TS 23.203 [19].
5) The PDN GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause).
6) The TWAN locally removes the UE context and deauthenticates and
disassociates the UE at Layer 2 according to IEEE Std. 802.11-2007 [64].
NOTE: The L2 disassociation serves as an indication to the UE that the
previous IPv4 address/IPv6 prefix might no longer be valid. When UE connects
to the network next time, the UE proceeds with re-validation or re-acquisition
of its IPv4 address / IPv6 prefix.
#### 16.3.1.2 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach Procedure in WLAN on GTP S2a
Figure 16.3.1.2-1: HSS/AAA Initiated Detach on GTP S2a
The procedure for HSS/AAA Initiated Detach from TWAN is represented in Figure
16.3.1.2-1 and described below.
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Home Routed Roaming and Local
Breakout cases. In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages
between the PDN GW and the hPCRF. In the Home Routed Roaming and LBO cases,
the 3GPP AAA Proxy serves as an intermediary between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access and the 3GPP AAA Server in the HPLMN. In the non-roaming and Home
Routed Roaming case, the vPCRF is not involved at all.
1) The HSS/AAA sends a Session Termination Request message to the TWAN to
detach a specific UE.
2) The step 2 to 6 of the UE/TWAN Initiated Detach procedure described in
clause 16.3.1.1 are followed.
3) TWAN sends a Session Termination Response message to 3GPP AAA Server. If
the detach procedure was initiated from the 3GPP AAA Server and if the UE no
longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA Server, the 3GPP AAA Server
communicates the HSS as described in clause 12.1.2. If the detach procedure
was initiated by HSS, the 3GPP AAA Server replies to the HSS as described in
clause 12.1.3.
NOTE: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW. The
PDN GW does not remove the GTP tunnels on S2a, since the TWAN is responsible
for removing the GTP tunnels on S2a. The PDN GW acknowledges the receipt of
the detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
### 16.3.2 Detach and PDN disconnection in WLAN on PMIP S2a
#### 16.3.2.1 UE/TWAN Initiated Detach and UE/TWAN requested PDN Disconnection
Procedure in WLAN on PMIP S2a
Figure 16.3.2.1-1: UE/TWAN Initiated Detach and UE/ TWAN requested PDN
Disconnection on PMIP S2a
The procedure is similar to GTP based S2a call flows in clause 16.3.1.1, with
the following differences:
\- Step 2 is a Proxy Binding Update. The details of the Proxy Binding Update
message are described in step 3 in clause 6.4.1.1.
\- Step 5 is a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement. The details of the Proxy Binding
Acknowledgement message are described in step 6 in clause 6.4.1.1.
#### 16.3.2.2 HSS/AAA Initiated Detach Procedure in WLAN on PMIP S2a
Figure 16.3.2.2-1: HSS/AAA Initiated Detach on PMIP S2a
The procedure is similar to GTP S2a call flow in clause 16.3.1.2, the
difference is that step 2 refers to figure 16.3.2.1-1.
NOTE: The HSS/AAA may also send a detach indication message to the PDN GW. The
PDN GW does not remove the PMIP tunnels on S2a, since the TWAN is responsible
for removing the PMIP tunnels on S2a. The PDN GW acknowledges the receipt of
the detach indication message to the 3GPP AAA Server.
## 16.4 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN on S2a
### 16.4.1 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN on GTP
S2a
This procedure depicted in figure 16.4.1-1 can be used to deactivate an S2a
dedicated bearer or deactivate all S2a bearers belonging to a PDN address, for
e.g., due to IP‑CAN session modification requests from the PCRF. If the
default S2a bearer belonging to a PDN connection is deactivated, the PDN GW
deactivates all S2a bearers belonging to the PDN connection.
Figure 16.4.1-1: PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation with GTP on S2a
This procedure applies to the Non-Roaming, Roaming and Local Breakout cases.
In the Local Breakout case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the PDN GW and
the hPCRF. In the non-roaming and home routed roaming cases, the vPCRF is not
involved at all.
The optional interaction steps between the PDN GW and the PCRF in the
procedures in figure 16..4.1-1 only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is
deployed. Otherwise policy may be statically configured within the PDN GW.
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW initiated Bearer Deactivation
procedure may for example be triggered due to \'IP‑CAN session Modification
procedure\', as defined in TS 23.203 [19]. In this case, the resources
associated with the PDN connection in the PDN GW are released.
2\. The PDN GW sends a Delete Bearer Request message (EPS Bearer Identity,
Cause) to the TWAN. This message can include an indication that all bearers
belonging to that PDN connection shall be released.
3\. If supported by the TWAN, the TWAN specific resources may be released in
the TWAN. The details of this step are out of the scope of 3GPP.
4\. The TWAN deletes the bearer contexts related to the Delete Bearer Request,
and acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the PDN GW by sending a Delete
Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity) message.
5\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection are
released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server/HSS of the PDN
disconnection.
6\. The PDN GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated S2a
bearer. If the dedicated bearer deactivation procedure was triggered by
receiving a PCC decision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the
PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was successfully enforced by
completing the PCRF-initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure or the
PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203
[19], proceeding after the completion of IP‑CAN bearer signalling.
### 16.4.2 PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation in WLAN on PMIP
S2a
The procedure and steps in clause 6.12.1 apply for PDN GW initiated resource
allocation. The Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access in clause 6.12.1 is a TWAN in this
architecture.
## 16.5 Dedicated bearer activation in WLAN on GTP S2a
The dedicated bearer activation procedure for GTP based S2a is depicted in
figure 16.5-1.
Figure 16.5-1: Dedicated S2a Bearer Activation Procedure with GTP on S2a
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS
policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the initial steps of the
PCRF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure or to the PCRF response
in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS
23.203 [19], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP‑CAN Bearer
Signalling. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS
policy.
2\. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to assign the S2a bearer QoS, i.e., it
assigns the values to the bearer level QoS parameters QCI, ARP, GBR and MBR.
The PDN GW sends a Create Bearer Request message (IMSI, EPS bearer QoS, TFT,
PDN GW Address for the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, Charging Id,
LBI) to the trusted WLAN access network. The Linked EPS bearer Identity (LBI)
is the EPS bearer Identity of the default bearer.
3\. A TWAN specific resource allocation/modification procedure may be executed
in this step. The details of this step are out of the scope of 3GPP.
4\. The TWAN selects an EPS bearer Identity, which has not yet been assigned
to the UE. The TWAN then stores the EPS bearer Identity and links the
dedicated bearer to the default bearer indicated by the Linked Bearer Identity
(LBI). The TWAN uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to determine the
mapping of uplink traffic flows to the S2a bearer. The TWAN then acknowledges
the S2a bearer activation to the PGW by sending a Create Bearer Response (EPS
bearer Identity, TWAN Address for the user plane, TWAN TEID of the user plane)
message.
5\. If the dedicated bearer activation procedure was triggered by a PCC
Decision Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF
whether the requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or not,
allowing the completion of the PCRF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification
procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as
defined in TS 23.203 [19], after the completion of IP‑CAN bearer signalling.
## 16.6 Network-initiated bearer modification in WLAN on GTP S2a
### 16.6.1 PDN GW Initiated Bearer Modification
The PDN GW initiated bearer modification procedure for a GTP based S2a is
depicted in figure 16.6.1-1. This procedure is used to update the TFT for an
active default or dedicated S2a bearer, or in cases when one or several of the
S2a bearer QoS parameters QCI, GBR, MBR or ARP are modified (including the QCI
or the ARP of the default S2a bearer e.g. due to the HSS Initiated Subscribed
QoS Modification procedure, as described in clause 16.6.2).
Figure 16.6.1-1: PDN GW-initiated S2a Bearer Modification Procedure with GTP
on S2a
1\. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision (QoS
policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the initial steps of the
PCRF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure or to the PCRF response
in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.203 [19], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP-CAN Bearer
Signalling. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS
policy.
2\. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to determine that a service data flow
shall be aggregated to or removed from an active S2a bearer or that the
authorized QoS of a service data flow has changed. The PDN GW generates the
TFT and updates the S2a bearer QoS to match the traffic flow aggregate. The
PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request (EPS bearer Identity, EPS bearer
QoS, TFT) message to the trusted WLAN access network.
3\. A TWAN specific resource allocation/modification procedure may be executed
in this step. The details of this step are out of the scope of 3GPP.
4\. The TWAN uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to determine the mapping
of traffic flows to the S2a bearer and acknowledges the S2a bearer
modification to the PGW by sending an Update Bearer Response (EPS bearer
Identity) message.
5\. If the Bearer modification procedure was triggered by a PCC Decision
Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the
requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or not by sending a
Provision Ack message allowing the completion of the PCRF-Initiated IP‑CAN
Session Modification procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session
Modification procedure as defined in TS 23.203 [19], after the completion of
IP‑CAN bearer signalling.
### 16.6.2 HSS Initiated Bearer Modification
The HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification for a GTP-based S2a is depicted
in figure 16.6.2-1.
Figure 16.6.2-1: HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification
1\. The HSS updates the User Profile as specified in clause 12.2.1.
2\. If the QCI and/or ARP and/or subscribed APN-AMBR has been modified and
there is a related active PDN connection with the modified QoS Profile, the
trusted WLAN access network sends the Modify Bearer Command (EPS bearer
Identity, EPS bearer QoS, APN AMBR) message to the PDN GW. The EPS bearer
Identity identifies the default bearer of the affected PDN connection. The EPS
bearer QoS contains the EPS subscribed QoS profile to be updated.
3\. If PCC infrastructure is deployed, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the
updated EPS bearer QoS. The PCRF sends the new updated PCC decision to the PDN
GW. This corresponds to the PCEF-initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification
procedure as defined in TS 23.203 [19].
The PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and the QoS parameters (QCI and ARP)
associated with the default bearer in the response to the PDN GW as defined in
TS 23.203 [19].
4\. The PDN GW modifies the default bearer of each PDN connection
corresponding to the APN for which subscribed QoS has been modified. If the
subscribed ARP parameter has been changed, the PDN GW shall also modify all
dedicated S2a bearers having the previously subscribed ARP value unless
superseded by PCRF decision. The PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request
(EPS bearer Identity, EPS bearer QoS, TFT, APN AMBR) message to the TWAN.
5\. A TWAN specific resource allocation/modification procedure may be executed
in this step. The details of this step are out of the scope of 3GPP.
6\. The TWAN acknowledges the bearer modification to the PDN GW by sending an
Update Bearer Response (EPS bearer Identity) message. If the bearer
modification fails the PDN GW deletes the concerned S2a Bearer.
7\. The PDN GW indicates to the PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was
enforced or not by sending a Provision Ack message.
###### ## Annex A (informative): GTP - PMIP Roaming
The scenarios below identify and describe various deployment scenarios for
interworking between EPC networks based on GTP and EPC networks based on PMIP.
The scenario described here are the direct peering scenario and the proxy-
based interworking.
# A.1 Direct Peering Scenario
The \"direct peering\" scenario consists in having one of the two roaming
partners provide support for both variants of roaming flavour (e.g. a PMIP
operator would support GTP-based roaming interface towards a GTP-only roaming
partner, or vice versa) in order to make roaming possible.
The support for such roaming flavour can be provided either on the same GW
node or on different GW nodes. Upon establishment of connectivity for a
specific roaming UE, the Visited network chooses a GTP-based or a PMIP-based
S8 interface (on the same GW node or on different GW nodes, note that for a
single user only a single Serving GW is allocated when connecting to EPC),
depending on the preferences of the roaming partner that owns the subscriber.
{width="5.995833333333334in" height="5.049305555555556in"}
Figure A.1-1: Direct peering examples: a) PMIP-based VPLMN to GTP-based HPLMN;
b) GTP-based VPLMN to PMIP-based HPLMN
Depicted in Figure A.1-1 (a) is an example of \"direct peering\" interworking
between a GTP-based HPLMN and a PMIP-based VPLMN. When roamers whose
subscription is owned by the GTP-based operator attach to the EPS network of
the PMIP-based operator, they are assigned a GTP-capable GW acting in the role
of S‑GW. The S‑GW selection is carried out by MME or SGSN based on the
subscriber\'s HPLMN. In case of the Serving GW supporting both GTP and PMIP,
the MME/SGSN should indicate the Serving GW which protocol should be used over
S5/S8 interface.
Depicted in Figure A.1-1 (b) is an example of \"direct peering\" interworking
between a PMIP-based HPLMN and a GTP-based VPLMN. When roamers whose
subscription is owned by the PMIP-based operator attach to the EPS network of
the GTP-based operator, they are assigned a GTP-capable S‑GW. The information
provided by the PMIP-based HPLMN for the P‑GW selection function must take
into account that the Visited network is GTP-only, in order to return either
the IP address (or an APN that can be resolved to an IP address according to
the PDN GW resolution mechanism) that points to a GTP-capable PDN GW.
Figure A.1-2 depicts the scenario in which a UE from a GTP-based network roams
in a PMIP-based network, local breakout is used, and home-routed bearers are
also possible. As with the home-routed case, the MME or SGSN in the PMIP-based
VPLMN selects a GTP-capable Serving GW, but it selects a PMIP capable PDN GW.
As a result, the S‑GW in this example supports both GTP and PMIP based S5/S8.
This allows the local breakout bearer and any associated home-routed bearer
for the user (e.g. the default bearer) to be served by the same Serving GW.
Support of S9 may not be required in all local breakout scenarios.
{width="5.995138888888889in" height="3.088888888888889in"}
Figure A.1-2: Direct peering example: Local Breakout, UE from GTP HPLMN
Roaming in PMIP VPLMN
Figure A.1-3 depicts the scenario in which a UE from a PMIP-based network
roams into a GTP-based network and local breakout is used. As with the home-
routed case, the MME/SGSN in the GTP-based VPLMN selects a GTP-capable Serving
GW and the PDN GW selection function selects a GTP-capable PDN GW. This allows
the local breakout bearer and any associated home-routed bearer for the user
(e.g., the default bearer) to be served by the same Serving GW. Support of S9
may not be required in all local breakout scenarios.

Figure A.1-3: Direct peering example: Local Breakout, UE from PMIP HPLMN
Roaming in GTP VPLMN
# A.2 Proxy-based interworking
In this scenario an Interworking Proxy (IWP) sits between the GTP-based PLMN
and the PMIP-based PLMN to perform protocol conversion between the GTP
protocol on one side and the PMIP and Diameter protocols on the other side.
Figure A.2-1: Roaming Via Interworking Proxy: a) GTP-based HPLMN to PMIP-based
VPLMN; b) PMIP-based HPLMN to GTP-based VPLMN
The IWP is inserted transparently in the signalling and bearer path i.e. no
changes to the GTP, PMIP and Diameter protocols are required.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Guidance for Contributors to this
Specification
The following guidance is provided for drafting figures for TS 23.402 (this
specification) that share some common procedures with TS 23.401 [4].
Representation of PMIP or GTP variants of S5/S8:
\- Flows to TS 23.401 [4] will contain the complete procedures for GTP-based
S5/S8.
\- In TS 23.401 [4], clause(s) of a flow that is different for PMIP version of
S5/S8 interface are shown surrounded by shaded box indexed by capital letter
in ascending order, e.g. \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.
At the bottom of the flow, the following text should be included, e.g.
NOTE 1: Procedure steps (A) and (B) for an PMIP-based S5/S8 are defined in TS
23.402 (this specification).
\- In TS 23.402 (this specification), each step for the relevant clause,
belonging to say annex A, of the flow should be indicated by \"A.1, A.2, ...\"
. In TS 23.402 (this specification) common clauses of the flow captured in TS
23.401 [4], should be indicated by shaded boxes with text, e.g. \"Procedures
in TS 23.401 [4], Figure x.y.z-k, before A\", \"Procedures in TS 23.401 [4],
Figure x.y.z-k, between A and B\", etc.
For an illustrative example of the drafting guidelines rule, please refer to
Figure 5.4.1-1 in TS 23.401 [4] and corresponding Figure 5.4.1-1-1 in this
specification.
Representation of different architectural cases:
\- For each case supported, indicate the presence of the optional network
entities that may be included in the procedure step. These optional entities
appear between the source and destination of the procedure interaction arc as
a gray circle. For example, a vPCRF may stand between the Serving GW and the
hPCRF.
\- In text following a procedure diagram, list the different cases supported
by the figure.
\- For each case that is supported, indicated what the role of the optional
network entity is, when it occurs in the interaction. For example, \"In the
roaming case, the vPCRF forwards messages between the Serving GW and the PDN
GW\".
While it is possible to describe these interactions in each step in which they
might occur, this will tend to clutter and complicate the procedure diagrams
and should be avoided. A single paragraph found beneath each procedure
including optional network elements should suffice to clarify that procedure.
Representation of the impact of multiple PDN connectivity:
\- In text following a procedure diagram, list the specific impacts arising
from multiple PDN connectivity. This will chiefly include a description of
which interactions in the figure may be repeated N times for each PDN
connected to.

\- Clause(s) of a PMIP-based S2b flow that is different for the GTP variant of
the S2b interface are shown surrounded by shaded box indexed by capital letter
in ascending order, e.g. \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.
At the bottom of the flow, the following text should be included, e.g.
NOTE 2: Procedure steps (A) and (B) for GTP-based S2b are defined in clause x.
\- In GTP based S2b call flows, each step for the relevant clause, belonging
to say annex A, of the flow should be indicated by \"A.1, A.2, ...\" . Common

the PMIP based S2b call flow, e.g. \"Procedures in Figure x.y.z-k, before A\",
\"Procedures in Figure x.y.z-k, between A and B\", etc.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Handover Flows Between Non-3GPP Accesses
# C.1 General
This clause describes non-exhaustive examples of flows for handover between
non-3GPP accesses connected to the EPC. The handover scenarios are based on
the mechanisms defined in clause 8 of this document.
# C.2 Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6
over S2c Handover
In this scenario, the session starts in (source) trusted non3GPP access using
DSMIPv6 over S2c. The session hands over to another (target) trusted non-3GPP
access system. The UE subsequently initiates DSMIPv6 with the same PDN GW to
maintain the IP session.
In the non-roaming case, none of the optional entities in Figure C.2-1 are
involved.
Figure C.2-1: Trusted non-3GPP to Trusted non-3GPP handover based on S2c
1\. The UE uses a source Trusted non-3GPP IP access system. It has a local IP
address from the non-3GPP system which is used as a care-of address in the
DSMIPv6 registration to the PDN GW. The UE maintains a security association
with the PDN GW.
2\. The UE decides to initiate an access procedure with a new, target Trusted
non-3GPP IP access. The procedure continues with the steps defined in Figure
8.6-1 (A)
3\. The UE continues the ongoing session(s) via the same PDN GW maintaining
the same IP address.
4\. Resources in the source Trusted Non-3GPP IP access are released.
# C.3 Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with PMIPv6 to Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access
with PMIPv6 Handover in the Non-Roaming Scenario
This clause shows a call flow for a handover when UE moves from an untrusted
non-3GPP IP access network to the trusted non-3GPP access network. PMIPv6 is
assumed to be used on S2a and S2b interfaces.
NOTE: The procedure is also applicable to the handover within PMIP-based S2a
interfaces or PMIP-based S2b interfaces.
Figure C.3-1: S2b to S2a (PMIPv6) Handover
This procedure supports the non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2.1), home-routed roaming
(Figure 4.2.3-1) and roaming with Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The
PCRF in the HPLMN is informed of the change of access and any change in the
policy that results is signalled to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access. The
signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In the case of roaming
with Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with the
vPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the above
figure only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy
may be statically configured with the gateways.
1) The UE is connected to the untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access. There is an IPsec
tunnel between the UE and the ePDG and a PMIPv6 tunnel between the ePDG and
the PDN GW.
2) The UE moves to a Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access network.
3) The access specific procedures of the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access are
performed. These procedures are outside of the scope of 3GPP.
4) The EAP authentication procedure is initiated and performed involving the
UE, Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server. In the roaming case,
there may be several AAA proxies involved. As part of the authentication
procedure, the information of the selected PDN GW, e.g. PDN GW\'s address, is
conveyed to the MAG in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses.
5) After successful authentication and authorization, the L3 attach procedure
is triggered.
6) The Trusted non-3GPP IP access initiates a Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to obtain
the rules required for the Trusted non-3GPP IP access to perform the bearer
binding.
7) The MAG function in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends Proxy Binding
Update message to the PDN GW.
8) The PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP CAN Session Modification Procedure
with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19] to inform the PCRF of the new IP-
CAN type and obtain the updates to the PCC rules.
9) The PDN GW processes the proxy binding update and creates a binding cache
entry for the UE. The PDN GW allocates IP address for the UE. The PDN GW then
sends a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement to the MAG function in the Trusted
Non-3GPP IP Access, including the IP address(s) allocated for the UE. The IP
address allocated is same as that was assigned to UE before over the Untrusted
Non-3GPP Accesses.
10) The PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the
PDN GW.
11) L3 attach procedure is completed. IP connectivity between the UE and the
PDN GW is set up for uplink and downlink direction over the trusted non-3GPP
IP access.
12) The PDN GW initiates resource allocation deactivation procedure in the
untrusted non-3GPP IP access as defined in clause 6.12 or clause 7.9.
# C.4 Trusted/Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access with DSMIPv6 to Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access with PMIPv6 Handover in the Non-Roaming Scenario
This clause shows a call flow for a handover when UE moves from a source
trusted/untrusted non-3GPP IP access network to a target trusted non-3GPP
access network. PMIPv6 is assumed to be used on S2a and DSMIPv6 is assumed to
be used on source trusted/untrusted access network.
Figure C.4-1: S2c over trusted or untrusted Non-3GPP IP access to S2a (PMIPv6)
Handover
This procedure supports the non-roaming (Figure 4.2.2.1), home routed roaming
(Figure 4.2.3-1) and roaming with Local breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4) case. The
PCRF in the HPLMN is informed of the change of access and any change in the
policy that results is signalled to the Trusted non-3GPP IP Access. The
signalling takes place through the vPCRF in the VPLMN. In the case of roaming
with Local Breakout, the PDN GW in the VPLMN exchanges messages with the
vPCRF.
The optional interaction steps between the gateways and the PCRF in the above
figure only occur if dynamic policy provisioning is deployed. Otherwise policy
may be statically configured with the gateways.
In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs, step 8 is repeated for each PDN the
UE is connected to. This step can occur in parallel for each PDN. Other
impacts related to the handover for multiple PDNs are described in clause 8.1.
Alternatively, if supported by non-3GPP access technology and if the UE does
not provide any APN upon handover attach in the trusted non-3GPP IP access,
Step 5 is repeated for each PDN the UE is connected to, instead of Step 8.
DSMIPv6 de-registration in step 9 will be performed for each PDN connection.
These steps can occur in parallel for each PDN.
1\. The UE is connected to the trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP Access using S2c.
1a. There is an IPsec tunnel between the UE and the ePDG if UE is connected
over untrusted access network.
2\. The UE moves to a Trusted Non-3GPP Access network.
3\. The EAP authentication procedure is initiated and performed involving the
UE, Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the 3GPP AAA Server. In the roaming case,
there may be several AAA proxies involved. As part of the authentication
procedure, the information of the selected PDN GW, e.g. PDN GW\'s address, is
conveyed to the MAG in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses. The PDNs the UE is
connected to are obtained from the HSS with the UE subscriber profile.
4\. After successful authentication and authorization, the L3 attach procedure
is triggered.
5\. The UE continues the attach to the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access as defined
in Steps 5-8 of Figure 8.2.2-1, except that the IP CAN session modification
defined in step 7 is triggered as explained below.
6\. L3 attach procedure is completed. IP connectivity between the UE and the
PDN GW is set for uplink and downlink direction over the trusted non-3GPP IP
access.
7\. The PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the
PDN GW. The UE can send/receive IP packets at this point.
8\. In case of connectivity to multiple PDNs, the UE establishes connectivity
to all the PDNs besides the Default PDN that the UE was connected to before
the handover as described in clause 6.8.1.
9\. The UE sends a BU (lifetime) to the PDN GW to de-register its DSMIPv6
binding that was created while the UE was in non-3GPP access system. The PDN
GW responds with a BA message.
Any time after step 5, prior to receiving the de-registration Binding Update
from the UE, the PDN GW may de-register the DSMIPv6 binding. In this case the
PDN GW shall send a Binding Revocation Indication message to the UE.
Following the de-registration of the DSMIPv6 binding due to reception of de-
registration Binding update or due to triggering Binding Revocation, the PDN
GW triggers PCEF initiated IP CAN session modification, instead of doing it as
part of the step 5.
10\. The PCRF initiates \"PCRF-initiated Gateway Control Session Termination\"
procedure to release the resources in the non-3GPP access. This procedure is
triggered by the PCEF-Initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification Procedure with the
PCRF.
# C.5 Handover Between Two Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Accesses Connected to the
Same ePDG
This handover case is handled by MOBIKE [18], i.e. the existing IPSec tunnel,
via the first untrusted non-3GPP IP access, is only modified for the use with
the second untrusted non-3GPP access (and not torn down and re-created from
scratch). It is assumed that the MOBIKE support indication has been sent by UE
to ePDG in the initial attach.
Figure C.5-1: Message flow for handover between two untrusted non-3GPP IP
accesses based on MOBIKE
The following steps are performed:
1\. The UE is connected via the IPSec tunnel to ePDG, from where a PMIPv6
tunnel is established to the PDN GW. The UE is utilizing a local IP address
(for previous IKEv2 signalling and outer IP header address).
2\. The UE disconnects on L2 from untrusted non-3GPP IP access 1.
3\. UE establishes L2 connectivity to untrusted non-3GPP IP access 2.
4\. Configuration of a local IP address. (In case of dual radio multihoming
capability with respect to the local IP address is required).
5\. MOBIKE update address message exchange (in both directions, initiated by
UE).
6\. MOBIKE address verification, initiated by ePDG; this step is optional as
per MOBIKE [18].
7\. The tunnel mapping (between PMIPv6 tunnel and IPSec tunnel) is updated.
8\. The modified IPSec tunnel is now in operation.
For dual radio, step 2 is done after step 8.
# C.6 Handovers between APs of a Non-3GPP Trusted WLAN Access on S2a
No specific mechanisms are defined to support AP-to-AP handover with and
without TWAG relocation. However, this does not preclude the support of IP
address preservation in handovers without TWAG relocation when supported by
procedures out of 3GPP scope.
###### ### Annex D: Void
###### ## Annex E (Informative): Gateway Relocation in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP
Access
Gateway relocation within the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access is possible using the
procedures defined in this clause. The trigger for gateway relocation and any
mechanisms for preserving or transferring context between gateways within the
Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access is considered out of scope of this specification
and should be handled within standards external to 3GPP.
In both the case of PMIPv6 and MIP v4 FACoA on S2a, the Gateway Control
Session for the target gateway of the relocation is established before the
intra-non-3GPP handover occurs. After the handover, the Gateway Control
Session in the source gateway of the handover is terminated.
The mobility management and policy control signalling are both shown as
optional messages. This is to allow flexibility depending on the requirements
of the trusted non-3GPP IP access system. This allows a policy control
signalling relocation (on Gxa) or a relocation of the local mobility anchor
(S2a) or both (Gxa and S2a).
# E.1 Gateway Relocation with PMIPv6 on S2a
{width="5.68125in" height="4.004166666666666in"}
Figure E.1-1: Gateway Relocation when PMIPv6 MM mechanism is used over S2a
When the Gateway Relocation procedure occurs in the Non-Roaming case (Figure
4.2.2-1), the vPCRF is not involved.
In the case of Roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4),
the vPCRF is employed to forward messages from the hPCRF in the home PLMN, by
way of the vPCRF in the VPLMN to the non-3GPP access.
1) A gateway relocation is triggered, to be initiated by the Trusted Non-3GPP
IP Access. These trigger is outside the scope of 3GPP standardization.
2) The target Gateway in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access sends a Gateway
Control Session Establishment message to the hPCRF.
3) The PCRF responds to the target Gateway an Ack Gateway Control Session
Establishment (QoS Rules, Event Triggers) message. The PCC rules provide the
PDN GW with information required to enforce the dedicated bearer policy. The
event triggers indicate to the PDN GW when to report an event back to the PCRF
related to the dedicated bearer.
4) The target Gateway sends a Proxy Binding Update (MN NAI) message to the PDN
GW to register the UE at the PDN-GW. The MN NAI identifies the UE.
5) After creating the binding cache entry for the UE, the PDN GW responds with
a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (MN NAI, Lifetime, UE Address Info) message to
the MAG. The MN NAI repeats the UE identity sent previously. The Lifetime
expresses the duration of validity of the binding. The UE Address info
includes the allocated IP Address(es) corresponding to the IP CAN session.
6) The PMIP tunnel from the target gateway to the PDN GW is established.
7) The source Gateway in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access system sends a Gateway
Control Session Termination to the PCRF. This gateway ceases to perform Bearer
Binding and associated policy controlled functions.
8) The PCRF sends an Acknowledge Gateway Control Session Termination message
to the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access acknowledging the termination of the control
session.
# E.2 Gateway Relocation with MIPv4 FACoA on S2a
Figure E.2-1: Gateway Relocation when MIPv4 FACoA mode MM mechanism is used
over S2a
When the Gateway Relocation procedure occurs in the Non-Roaming case (Figure
4.2.2-1), the vPCRF is not involved.
In the case of Roaming (Figure 4.2.3-1) and Local Breakout (Figure 4.2.3-4),
the vPCRF is employed to forward messages from the hPCRF in the home PLMN, by
way of the vPCRF in the VPLMN to the non-3GPP access.
1) A gateway relocation is triggered, to be initiated by the UE. This trigger
is outside the scope of 3GPP standardization.
2) The UE sends a Registration Request (RRQ) RFC 5944 [12] message to the FA.
Reverse Tunnelling shall be requested. This ensures that all traffic will go
through the PDN GW. The RRQ message shall include the NAI-Extension RFC 2794
[34] and the Home Agent Address.
3) The Trusted non-3GPP access initiates the Gateway Control Session
Establishment Procedure with the PCRF, as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The
Trusted non-3GPP access provides the information to the PCRF to correctly
associate it with the IP CAN session to be established in Step 9 and also to
convey subscription related parameters to the PCRF.
4) The FA processes the message according to RFC 5944 [12] and forwards a
corresponding RRQ message to the PDN GW.
5) The PDN GW allocates an IP address for the UE and sends a Registration
Reply (RRP) RFC 5944 [12] to the FA, including the IP address allocated for
the UE.
6) The Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network initiates the Gateway Control Session
Termination Procedure with the PCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [19]. The
Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network no longer applies QoS policy to service data
flows for this UE.
7) The FA processes the RRP according to RFC 5944 [12] and sends a
corresponding RRP message to the UE.
8) IP connectivity from the UE to the PDN GW is now setup. A MIP tunnel is
established between the FA in the Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the PDN GW.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Deployment of Non-3GPP Trusted WLAN Access on
S2a
WLAN networks may be deployed such that separate SSIDs are used for EPC-routed
and non-seamless WLAN offload, e.g. \ and \.
WLAN networks may also be deployed such that the same SSID in a WLAN Access
Point provides different type of network access to different users attached to
this Access Point. For example, a given SSID \ may provide EPC-routed
access for subscriber A and only allow non-seamless WLAN offload for
subscriber B. In such a deployment it is up to the operator to provide network
configuration that supports different user access preferences, subscriptions
and UE configurations.
It is recommended that the UE can be configured to apply different behavior
when connected to different SSIDs, e.g. allow or prevent the usage of certain
applications on specific SSIDs. For example, for the SSIDs used for EPC access
through S2a over Trusted WLAN, the UE can be configured to disable
applications that require local connectivity (e.g. DLNA applications) and
enable applications that require EPC connectivity to the default APN used for
access through S2a over Trusted WLAN. Such kind of special behavior for SSIDs
used for EPC access through S2a over Trusted WLAN can improve the user
experience and prolong the UE battery life.
NOTE: A UE can be configured to apply different behavior when connected to
different SSIDs by means which are outside the scope of this document. For
example, the UE can be configured over-the-air, by means of a downloadable
application, or manually.
