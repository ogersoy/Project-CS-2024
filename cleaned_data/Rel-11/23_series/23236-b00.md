# Introduction
UMTS will build on the success of GSM and is likely to become even more
widespread, increasing the importance of a flexible network structure to
permit the different operational configurations in which these networks will
be deployed. The requirements to have a RNC or BSC controlled by a single MSC
server or SGSN lead to certain limitations. Allowing the BSCs and RNCs to
connect to a number of MSC servers or SGSNs increases the networks performance
in terms of scalability, distributing the network load amongst the serving
entities, and reducing the required signalling as the user roams.
# 1 Scope
This document covers the details for the Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes
to Multiple CN Nodes for GERAN and UTRAN based systems. In particular, it
details the impacts to GSM and UMTS systems and the stage 2 procedures for the
support of connecting a RNC or BSC to multiple MSC servers or SGSNs. The
overall solution is described, and the detailed impacts on the existing
specifications are identified. The description of a broadly similar concept
for E-UTRAN based systems is not described in the document: instead, it is
described in TS 23.401 [22].
NOTE: The specified solution impacts RAN nodes. In case an upgrade of radio
networks is not performed, the solutions for deploying NNSF functionality
above RAN nodes described in TR 23.924 [23] may be used as a guideline for
connecting RAN nodes to multiple MSC servers.
The reference model to which these procedures apply can be found within TS
23.002 [1]. Detailed architectural requirements within the subsystems are
contained within the remainder of the 23 series of specifications e.g. the
requirements for the Packet Switched (PS) domain are contained within TS
23.060 [2] and the requirements for the Bearer Independent CS Core Network are
contained in TS 23.205 [14].

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms defined in TR 21.905 [8]
apply:
**CN node:** for the purpose of this specification, and unless otherwise
stated, a CN node is either an MSC or an SGSN.
**NAS node selection Function** : The function used to assign specific network
resources (i.e. MSC or SGSN) to serve a mobile station and subsequently route
the traffic to the assigned network resource.
**Network Resource Identifier:** A specific parameter used to identify the CN
node assigned to serve a mobile station.
**Non-broadcast LAI/RAI:** Each CN node in a pool have to be assigned one
unique non-broadcast LAI/RAI that it use in case it want to be offloaded. Each
CN node in the pool has to be aware of the non-broadcast LAI/RAI assigned to
the other CN nodes in the pool, because in case of re-distribution the
\'target CN node\' will retrieve data (e.g. IMSI, security context, MM & PDP
contexts) from the \'offloaded CN node\' based on non-broadcast LAI/RAI.
**Null-NRI:** A \'null-NRI\' indicates to a radio node (BSC/RNC) that the NAS
Node Selection Function shall be used for selecting a CN node to receive a
message. There is one unique \'null-NRI\' in a PLMN supporting pool
functionality. In MOCN shared networks (see TS 23.251 [21]) with multiple CN
Operators, there is one unique \'null-NRI\' per CN operator. That is, in MOCN
networks the RAN Operator handles multiple \'null-NRIs\'.
**Pool-area:** A pool area is an area within which a MS may roam without need
to change the serving CN node. A pool area is served by one or more CN nodes
in parallel. All the cells controlled by a RNC or BSC belong to the same one
(or more) pool area(s).
**RAN node:** for the purpose of this specification, and unless otherwise
stated, a RAN node is either an RNC or a BSC.
**RAN node service area:** This area contains all the cells controlled by the
RNC or BSC.

# 4 General Description
## 4.1 Iu Flex Technical Requirements
This provides a (non-exhaustive) set of technical requirements:
1\. Iu Flex capable RAN nodes such as the RNC/BSC shall be able to select any
CN node such as the SGSN/MSC-Server within a pool area
2\. Iu Flex capable RAN nodes and CN nodes shall be able to co-exist with pre
Release 5 RAN nodes and pre Release 5 CN nodes.

the UE shall store it.
4\. The UE shall provide the routing information received from the serving CN
node to the RAN node. In some cases, this serving CN node may be an Evolved
Packet Core MME.
5\. The solution shall enable the reduction of signalling within the core
network (e.g. reduction of the HLR signalling traffic).
6\. The solution shall enable an improved scaling between radio access nodes
and the core network nodes.
## 4.2 Overview
Editor\'s Note: Clarification is required in order to remove RAN nodes and CN
node terminology and to capture that this is referring to the control
signalling aspects.
The Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes overcomes the
strict hierarchy, which restricts the connection of a RAN node to just one CN
node. This restriction results from routing mechanisms in the RAN nodes which
differentiate only between information to be sent to the PS or to the CS
domain CN nodes and which do not differentiate between multiple CN nodes in
each domain. The Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes
introduces a routing mechanism (and other related functionality), which
enables the RAN nodes to route information to different CN nodes within the CS
or PS domain, respectively.
The Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes introduces
further the concept of "pool-areas" which is enabled by the routing mechanism
in the RAN nodes. A pool-area is comparable to an MSC or SGSN service area as
a collection of one or more RAN node service areas. In difference to an MSC or
SGSN service area a pool-area is served by multiple CN nodes (MSCs or SGSNs)
in parallel which share the traffic of this area between each other.
Furthermore, pool-areas may overlap which is not possible for MSC or SGSN
service areas. From a RAN perspective a pool-area comprises all LA(s)/RA(s) of
one or more RNC/BSC that are served by a certain group of CN nodes in
parallel. One or more of the CN nodes in this group may in addition serve
LAs/RAs outside this pool-area or may also serve other pool-areas. This group
of CN nodes is also referred to as MSC pool or SGSN pool respectively.
The Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes enables a few
different application scenarios with certain characteristics. The service
provision by multiple CN nodes within a pool-area enlarges the served area
compared to the service area of one CN node. This results in reduced inter CN
node updates, handovers and relocations and it reduces the HLR update traffic.
The configuration of overlapping pool-areas allows to separate the overall
traffic into different MS moving pattern, e.g. pool-areas where each covers a
separate residential area and all the same city centre. Other advantages of
multiple CN nodes in a pool-area are the possibility of capacity upgrades by
additional CN nodes in the pool-area or the increased service availability as
other CN nodes may provide services in case one CN node in the pool-area
fails.
An MS is served by one dedicated CN node of a pool-area as long as it is in
radio coverage of the pool-area. Figure 1 shows most of the possible pool-area
configurations. It contains CS pool-area 1 (RAN area 1, 2, 5, 6 served by MSCs
1, 2, 3), CS pool-areas 2 (RAN area 2, 3, 6, 7 served by MSCs 4, 5, 6), PS
pool-area 1 (RAN area 1, 5 served by SGSNs 1, 2) and PS pool-area 2 (RAN area
2, 3, 6, 7 served by SGSNs 3, 4, 5). In addition the RAN areas 4 and 8 are
served by MSC 7 and SGSN 6 without any usage of the Intra Domain Connection of
RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes. The possibility to configure overlapping pool-
areas is shown by the CS pool-areas 1 and 2. The PS pool-areas 1 and 2 are
configured non-overlapping. The pool-areas of the CS and the PS domain may be
configured identical as CS pool-area 2 and PS pool-area 2 or they may be
configured differently as shown by CS pool-area 1 and PS pool-area 1. The
number or capacity of CN nodes is configured independently for each pool-area.
The usage of the Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes may
be configured in parts of the network only. It co-exists with other areas not
using this feature as shown in the figure with RAN areas 4 and 8 which are
served by MSC 7 and SGSN 6.

## 4.3 Pool-Area and Network Resource Identification
A pool-area is an area within which an MS may roam without a need to change
the serving CN node. A pool-area is served by one or more CN nodes in
parallel. The complete service area of a RAN node (RNC or BSC) belongs to the
same one or more pool-area(s). A RAN node service area may belong to multiple
pool-areas, which is the case when multiple overlapping pool-areas include
this RAN node service area. The pool-areas of the CS and of the PS domain are
configured independently with the granularity of RAN node service areas.
Therefore, all uniqueness statements below apply to each of the domains
(CS/PS) separately. If LAs or RAs span over multiple RAN node service areas
then all these RAN node service areas have to belong to the same pool-area.
The Network Resource Identifier (NRI) identifies uniquely an individual CN
node out of all CN nodes, which serve in parallel a pool-area. The length of
the NRI shall be the same in all nodes of a domain in one pool-area. In areas
where pool-areas overlap the NRI identifies uniquely a CN node out of all CN
nodes, which serve all these overlapping pool-areas, i.e. an NRI identifies
uniquely a CN node within a RAN node. In case of overlapping pool-areas the
NRI length shall be configured to be the same in all the nodes of a specific
domain serving these pool-areas. Note again, that the NRIs of the CS and the
PS domain are independent of each other as the PS and the CS domain CN nodes
are addressed independently. More than one NRI may be assigned to a CN node.
The NRI is part of the temporary identity TMSI (CS domain) or P-TMSI (PS
domain), which is assigned by the serving CN node to the MS. Each CN node
which supports the \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN
Nodes\" is configured with its specific one or more NRI(s). The (P-)TMSI
allocation mechanism in the CN node generates (P-)TMSIs which contain a
configured NRI in the relevant bit positions. The NRI has a flexible length
between 10 and 0 bits (0 bits means the NRI is not used and the feature is not
applied).
In Iu mode the MS provides an Intra Domain NAS Node Selector (IDNNS) TS 25.331
[5] in the AS part of the RRC-Initial-direct-transfer message to the RAN node
(RNC or BSC). The IDNNS contains a routing parameter with a fixed length of 10
bits. This routing parameter transports the NRI value. In addition the IDNNS
contains an indication from which identity (TMSI, IMSI, IMEI, ...) the routing
parameter is derived. The RAN node masks the significant bits out of the
routing parameter part of the IDNNS to determine the NRI which is relevant to
identify the CN node. The most significant bit of the NRI shall correspond
with the most significant bit of the routing parameter in the IDNNS. When the
IDNNS is derived from the IMSI, the IDNNS has a value (V) from the range 0 to
999 as defined in TS 25.331 [5]. The RAN node shall be configured to use the
value (V) to select a CN node. Each value (V) corresponds a single CN node.
Typically many values of (V) may point to the same CN node. In A/Gb mode.
In A/Gb-mode for the A interface the RAN node derives the NRI from any initial
NAS signalling message. The RAN node masks the significant bits out of the
TMSI to determine the NRI, which identifies the CN node. In A/Gb-mode for the
Gb interface the RAN node derives the NRI from the TLLI. The RAN node masks
the significant bits out of the TLLI to determine the NRI, which identifies
the CN node.
For all three cases, Iu, A interface and Gb mode, it is configured in the RAN
node which bits out of the information elements provided by the MS are
significant for the NRI The NRI is coded in bits 23 to 14 of TMSI or P-TMSI.
Regardless of the NRI length the most significant bit of the NRI is always in
bit 23 of TMSI or P-TMSI(examples of NRI position are given in annex A.2), see
also TS 23.003 [18].
The whole network may be configured as one pool-area, a network may configure
multiple pool-areas and the configuration of pool-areas may be combined with
MSC or SGSN service areas which are not belonging to pool-areas. The change of
a pool-area is not visible to the MS. In general there is no need to detect a
pool-area change. It may be advantageous for load balancing purposes to detect
pool-area changes in the network to distribute MSs entering a pool-area to CN
nodes with an appropriate load status. MSs changing a pool-area may be
detected by configuration of different NRI values for adjacent pool-areas. The
pool-area change information potentially provided in the IDNNS by an MS in Iu
mode is ignored by the network.
## 4.4 NAS Node Selection Function
This function is used in RAN nodes and potentially in CN nodes. In the RAN
node the function selects the specific CN node (i.e. MSC or SGSN) to which
initial NAS signalling messages or LLC frames are routed. The NRI identifies
the specific CN node. If the NAS Node Selection Function has a CN node address
configured for the NRI derived from the initial NAS signalling message or from
the LLC frame then this message or frame is routed to this address. If no CN
node address is configured for the derived NRI or if no NRI can be derived
(e.g. the MS indicated an identity which contains no NRI) then the NAS Node
Selection Function selects an available CN node (e.g. according to load
balancing) and routes the message or LLC frame to the selected CN node.
The pool-area has no influence on the decisions of the NAS Node Selection
Function as pool-areas may overlap. The NAS Node Selection Function in the RAN
node derives the NRI from the IDNNS when the MS is supported in Iu mode. When
the MS is supported in Gb mode the NRI is derived from the TLLI and for A
interface mode the NRI is derived from the TMSI.
NOTE: A routing-area update after SRNS relocation is not an initial NAS
signalling message, thus it is routed along the existing Iu-connection to the
SGSN.
In A/Gb mode in case a MSC/VLR sends a paging-request/paging with IMSI (i.e.
the paging message does not contain a TMSI), the NAS node selection function
in the BSC shall upon reception temporarily store the Global-CN- ID of the
node that issued the paging-request/paging message. If the NAS node selection
function in A/Gb mode receives a paging-response with an IMSI then it should
check the temporarily stored Global-CN-ID on entries matching this IMSI and
forward the paging-response to the node identified by this Global-CN-ID.
In Iu mode in case a MSC/VLR sends a paging-request/paging with IMSI (i.e. the
paging message does not contain a TMSI), the NAS node selection function in
the BSC/RNC may upon reception temporarily store the Global-CN-ID of the node
that issued the paging-request/paging message. If the NAS node selection
function in Iu mode receives an Initial Direct Transfer message with an IDNNS
derived from IMSI as a result of IMSI paging:
\- and if BSC/RNC has temporarily stored the Global-CN-ID then it should check
the temporarily stored Global-CN-ID on entries matching this IDNNS and forward
the paging-response to the node identified by this Global-CN-ID or
\- the BSC/RNC shall use the IDNNS derived from IMSI to select a CN node. In
this case the IDNNS has a value (V) from the range 0 to 999 as defined in TS
25.331 [5]. The RAN node shall be configured to use the value (V) to select a
CN node. Each value (V) corresponds a single CN node. Typically many values of
(V) may point to the same CN node.
In UMTS, an MS answering a paging with IMSI includes in its response an IDNNS
derived from its TMSI, if the MS has a valid TMSI. Temporarily storing the
IMSI in the RNC increases the success rate to reach the MS that have both lost
their TMSI and are paged with IMSI. In GSM, an MS paged with IMSI always
answers with IMSI.
If the MSC/VLR initiates the paging procedure via Gs-interface the SGSN has to
add the MSC/VLR-identity to the paging-request/paging message.
An MS will return an Attach Request containing the IMSI parameter as a
response to a PS IMSI paging. Also, a PS IMSI paging is not time supervised
from the SGSN sending the message. Therefore the RAN node receiving such a
paging request does not have to buffer the associated SGSN identity. This
again means that the NAS Node Selection Function in the RAN node selects an
available SGSN (e.g. according to load balancing) when it receives an Attach
Request containing the IMSI parameter.
## 4.5 Load Balancing
Preferably, the NAS Node Selection Function in the RAN node balances the load
between the available CN nodes. This is performed by an appropriate selection
of the CN node for an MS which was not yet assigned to a CN node, i.e. when
there is no CN node configured for the NRI indicated by the MS, when a
\'random TLLI\' is received (Gb-mode BSC), when no NRI can be derived or in
exceptional cases, e.g. when the CN node corresponding to an NRI cannot be
reached.
The load-balancing algorithm is implementation specific.
When the NAS Node Selection Function in the RAN (or, if using Network Mode of
Operation I, the SGSN) receives an indication that the MS is configured for
low access priority (e.g. because it is used for Machine Type Communication),
the NAS Node Selection Function may take this indication into account when
selecting the CN node (e.g. to select an MSC that has a particularly large VLR
capacity).
In case of handover/relocation into a pool-area a load balancing between all
the target CN nodes serving this pool-area is gained by configuration. Source
CN nodes which support Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN
Nodes may be configured with all possible target CN nodes for each
handover/relocation target. Source CN nodes which do not support the Intra
Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes can configure only one
target CN node per handover/relocation target. In this case each of source CN
nodes which handover/relocate to the same pool-area may be configured with
another target CN node out of all target CN nodes serving the same
handover/relocation target. The mechanism for distribution of the traffic
between the handover/relocation target CN nodes is implementation specific.
This load balancing is complemented by the NAS Node selection Function in the
RAN, which distributes MSs between the CN nodes when these MSs enter the pool-
area in idle mode.
As more than one SGSN may send downlink data at the same time for a cell or a
BVCI the total possible downlink traffic has to shared between the SGSNs as
described in clause 5.3.2.
In case of CS domain subsequent handover/relocation, if the controlling MSC
supports Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes then it
should check the target indicated by the serving MSC. If it is in its own pool
area then the handover/relocation is handled as one back to the controlling
MSC (the target MSC indicated by the serving MSC is not taken into account).
If the target location is not in its own pool area then the target MSC
indicated by the serving MSC is taken into account as normal
(handover/relocation to a third MSC).
If the controlling (anchor) MSC is not in the same pool as target third MSC
and if the controlling MSC does not support Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN nodes, because the serving MSC can select any third MSC
in the target pool area, the operator should configure the addresses of all
possible third MSCs within the controlling MSC.
## 4.5a Load Re-Distribution
### 4.5a.1 General
There are situations where a network operator will wish to remove load from
one CN node in an orderly manner (e.g. to perform scheduled maintenance, or,
to perform load re-distribution to avoid overload) with minimal impact to end
users and/or additional load on other entities. The re-distribution procedure
does not require any new functionality in the terminal, that is, all terminals
can be moved.
Re-distribution of UEs is initiated via an O&M command in the CN node, which
needs to be off-loaded. In a first phase (a couple of Periodic LU/RAU periods
long), UEs doing LU/RAU or Attach are moved to other CN nodes in the pool.
When the CN node receives the Location Update, Routing Area Update or Attach
request, it returns a new TMSI/P-TMSI with a null-NRI, and a non-broadcast
LAI/RAI in the accept message.
In CS domain the non-broadcast LAI will cause the terminal to immediately send
a new Location Update, which the RAN node then will route to a new MSC due to
the null-NRI. In the PS domain, a new Routing Area Update is triggered by
setting the periodic routing area update timer to a sufficiently low value
(recommended value is 4 seconds) in the accept message. The UE will shortly
after send a new Routing Area Update that the RAN node then will route to a
new SGSN due to the presence of a null-NRI.
In a second phase (PS domain specific), the SGSN requests all UEs trying to
set up PDP Contexts to detach & reattach. When they reattach, the SGSN moves
them as in the first phase described above.
A third phase includes scanning through remaining UEs and initiating a move of
them to other CN nodes. In the PS domain UEs are requested to detach and
reattach, which will cause them to be moved. In case of CS domain a new TMSI
is allocated to these UEs using the TMSI re-allocation procedure (with null-
NRI and non-broadcast LAI) so that a Location Update is triggered when the
ongoing CM transaction ends, which will cause them to be moved.
UEs being moved from one CN node are stopped from registering to the same CN
node again by an O&M command in BSCs and RNCs connected to the pool. UEs
moving into a pool area may also be stopped from registering into a CN node
being off-loaded in the same manner.
In network configurations using MOCN network sharing, re-distribution is
always done between CN nodes within the same CN Operator. This is ensured by
each CN Operator using his own unique null-NRI. The RAN node is preconfigured
with the null-NRIs for the different CN Operators, and it uses the null-NRI to
select a CN node within the same CN Operator.
A CN node should ensure that move operations does not overload the network.
BSCs and RNCs shall be able to handle situations where several CN nodes are
off-loaded simultaneously.
### 4.5a.2 Network Mode of Operation = 1
If an operator is using Network Mode of Operation = 1 (i.e. using combined MM
and GMM procedures and the Gs interface), then redistribution of MSC load
needs to be handled in a special way.
Redistribution of UEs is initiated by O&M command in the SGSN providing the Gs
interface to the MSC to be off-loaded. The corresponding NRI distribution or
IMSI Hash table is reconfigured to reflect the redistribution. If the SGSNs
are also configured in a pool, this is repeated for any SGSN connected to that
MSC. The NRI distribution or IMSI Hash table shall have a consistent
configuration in all SGSNs in the pool (to ensure that a redistribution of
SGSN load doesn\'t affect the MSC registration of UEs).
The redistribution is done in two phases. During the first phase, the UEs that
are performing combined RA/LA updates are moved to a new MSC. When the SGSN
receives a Routing Area Update Request (combined RA/LA updating), it checks if
the particular UE shall be moved (i.e. it has a Gs association with the MSC
being off-loaded). If the UE shall be moved, the SGSN invokes the MSC
selection function (NRI distribution or IMSI Hash) to decide where the UE
should be distributed. SGSN sends the (BSSAP+) Location-Update-Request (IMSI
attach) to the new selected MSC where the UE is registered. Stationary UEs
(i.e. UEs not performing RA/LA updates) are not moved during this first phase.
During the second phase, the SGSN scans its Gs associations to find out which
UEs shall be moved. For each UE with an association to the MSC being off-
loaded, the SGSN sends a Detach Request (indicating IMSI detach). The UE is
forced to re-attach to non-GPRS service (note that there is no impact on PDP
contexts in this case). The UE sends a RAU request (combined RA/LA updating
with IMSI Attach). SGSN checks if the UE shall be moved. If the UE shall be
moved, the SGSN invokes the MSC selection function (NRI distribution or IMSI
Hash) to select another MSC. SGSN sends the (BSSAP+) Location-Update-Request
(IMSI attach) to the new MSC where the UE is registered.
During the redistribution, incoming IMSI Detach messages are (as during normal
operation) routed to respective existing associated MSC. That is, the
reconfigured NRI distribution or IMSI Hash doesn\'t affect the routing of IMSI
Detach messages.
## 4.6 Mobility Management
An MS performs LA or RA Updates and Attachments, which may result in a change
of the serving CN node. In these procedures the new CN node requests from the
old CN node MS specific parameters. If multiple CN nodes are configured in the
new CN node for the old RA or LA indicated by the MS then the new CN node
derives the NRI from the old (P-)TMSI indicated by the MS. The new CN node
uses the old RA or LA together with the NRI to derive the signalling address
of the old CN node from its configuration data. If the network contains nodes
that cannot derive the old CN node from LAI/RAI and NRI a default CN node for
each RA or LA (as described below) shall be used to resolve the ambiguity of
the multiple CN nodes serving the same area.
## 4.7 Default CN node and Backwards Compatibility
CN nodes that can only derive one CN node from the LAI or RAI (e.g. because
they do not support the Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN
Nodes, or no detailed knowledge of the NRIs is configured) are not aware, that
multiple CN nodes may serve a LA or RA. These nodes can therefore contact only
one CN node per LA or RA, respectively. This node will further on be referred
to as default node.
A default node resolves the ambiguity of the multiple CN nodes per LA or RA by
deriving the NRI from the TMSI and P-TMSI. The default node relays the
signalling between the new CN node and the old CN node.
Note that the default node is configured per LA or RA. So different CN nodes
in a network might have configured different default nodes for a LA or RA.
With this approach more than one of the CN nodes that serve a pool-area can be
used as default-node, so load concentration on one node and a single point of
failure can be avoided.
Note further, that it may be required to keep information on ongoing MAP/GTP
dialogues in the default nodes.
The handover/relocation from CN nodes which do support the Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes to CN nodes not supporting this
features does not need a NAS Node Selection Function in the originating CN
node as there is only one target CN node. The originating CN node discovers
from its configuration data, that there is only one target CN node for the
requested handover/relocation target ID. See clause 4.5 for handling of
subsequent handover/relocation in the controlling CN node.
## 4.8 Support of combined mobility management procedures
### 4.8.1 Attach
In case of \'combined GPRS/IMSI attach\' or \'GPRS attach when already IMSI
attached\', the SGSN sends the Location Update Request message to the MSC/VLR.
The SGSN selects an MSC/VLR from the available MSC/VLRs which serve the
current LA of the MS. The selection is based on the TMSI based NRI as provided
by the UE or a hash value derived from the IMSI. It is configured in the SGSN
which NRI values and range of the hash values relates to which MSC/VLR. This
selection mechanism avoids a random change of the MSC/VLR for MSs using
combined procedures when an SGSN fails. The new SGSN will select the same
MSC/VLR.
In some networks, the SGSN may be configured to select the MSC/VLR for \"MSs
configured for low access priority\" with a different load balance to that
used for MSC/VLR selection for other UEs. In this case the SGSN maintains a
separate NRI and hash value function for \"MSs configured for low access
priority\".
### 4.8.2 Routing area update
The CN node changes in the following considerations result from pool-area
changes (when pool-areas are configured) or from CN node service area changes
(when no pool-areas are configured). For each domain (PS or CS) it is
configured independently whether pool-areas are used or not.
When neither the MSC nor the SGSN are changed, the association for an MS
between both CN nodes will also not change.
When the MSC changes but the SGSN does not change, the SGSN selects a new MSC
because the new LA is not served by the old MSC/VLR. The selection mechanism
is as described for the attach above.
When the SGSN changes but the MSC does not change, the new SGSN selects the
old MSC to establish a Gs association because the new SGSN uses the same
selection mechanism as described above for the attach with the same parameters
as configured in the old SGSN.
When both the MSC and the SGSN change, the new SGSN selects a new MSC to
establish a Gs association. The selection mechanism is as described for the
attach above.
## 4.9 VGCS/VBS Compatibility Issues
Voice Group Call Services, TS 43.068 [19], as well as Voice Broadcast Service,
TS 43.069 [20], are specified for A-interface only. Architectural enhancements
and procedures needed to support these services in an area where Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes is applied on the A-interface are
specified in TS 43.068 [19] and TS 43.069 [20].
## 4.10 Interactions with E-UTRAN
The MS has separate core network temporary identities for GERAN/UTRAN (the RAI
plus Pâ€‘TMSI in the packet domain) and Eâ€‘UTRAN (the GUTI).
Following movement between GERAN/UTRAN and Eâ€‘UTRAN the MS will have both a
Pâ€‘TMSI and a GUTI. Independent of whether the Idle mode Signalling Reduction
(ISR) feature is active, one or both of the Pâ€‘TMSI and GUTI may be valid. If
the MS is E UTRAN capable, then TS 23.401 [22], TS 23.060 [2] and TS 23.003
[18] define rules as to how the MS shall select and encode the identity to
place in the Pâ€‘TMSI/TLLI parameters used in the Routing Area Update procedure.
NOTE: ISR is specified and described in TS 23.401 [22].
In some network deployments the MME and SGSN may be combined in the same
physical platform (while in other deployments they may be separated).
TS 23.003 [18] specifies a mapping from the Eâ€‘UTRAN core network temporary
identity (the GUTI) to the TLLI that facilitates the BSC to route an RA update
caused by movement from Eâ€‘UTRAN to GERAN to an SGSN that is on the same
physical platform as the MME.
TS 23.003 [18] and TS 25.331 [5] specify a mapping from the Eâ€‘UTRAN core
network temporary identity (the GUTI) to the IDNNS that facilitates the RNC to
route an RA update caused by movement from Eâ€‘UTRAN to UTRAN to an SGSN that is
on the same physical platform as the MME.
TS 23.003 [18] also specifies a mapping from the RAI and Pâ€‘TMSI to the GUTI
that facilitates the Eâ€‘UTRAN to route to an MME that is on the same physical
platform as the SGSN. For this mapping function to work correctly when using
combined MME/SGSNs, the effective maximum length of the NRI is reduced from 10
bits to 8 bits.
# 5 Functional Description
## 5.1 MS Functions
In Iu mode the MS provides the IDNNS to the RNC in the access stratum part of
the _RRC_initial_DT_ message as described in TS 25.331 [5].
If the MS is Eâ€‘UTRAN capable, then TS 23.401 [22], TS 23.060 [2] and TS 23.003
[18] define rules as to how the MS shall select and encode the identity to
place in the Pâ€‘TMSI/TLLI parameters used in the Routing Area Update procedure.
For the PS domain, the Eâ€‘UTRAN capable MS shall use this Pâ€‘TMSI parameter to
derive the UTRAN IDNNS parameter. For the CS domain, the Eâ€‘UTRAN temporary
identities shall not be used to derive the IDNNS: instead the MS shall use its
(MSC supplied) TMSI, if that TMSI is valid, to derive the IDNNS.
NOTE: movement of an Eâ€‘UTRAN capable MS between GERAN/UTRAN and Eâ€‘UTRAN
accesses does not cause the TMSI to be marked as invalid or deleted.
When the MS in Iu mode replies to IMSI paging, it shall derive IDNNS from
(P)TMSI if a valid one is available. If (P)TMSI is not available, the MS shall
derive IDNNS from IMSI.
No further changes are expected in the MS for Gb or A interface mode.
## 5.2 RNC Functions
The RNC provides the NAS Node Selection Function. It masks the significant
number of bits out of the IDNNS provided by the MS together with the initial
NAS signalling message. The significant number of bits is configured in the
RNC. The NAS Node Selection Function derives from the NRI the address of the
specific CN node for the relevant domain (CS or PS). The association between
NRI values and CN node addresses is configured in the RNC (O&M).
The RNC routes the initial NAS signalling messages according to the NRI and
the \"domain indicator\" (CS or PS) to the relevant CN node if a CN node
address is configured in the RNC for the specific NRI and the requested domain
(CS or PS).
When IDNNS is derived from the IMSI, the IDNNS has a value (V) from the range
0 to 999 as defined in TS 25.331 [5]. The RAN node shall be configured to use
the value (V) to select a CN node. Each value (V) corresponds a single CN
node. Typically many values of (V) may point to the same CN node. In some
networks, the RAN node may be configured to select the MSC/VLR for \"UEs
configured for low access priority\" with a different load balance to that
used for MSC/VLR selection for other UEs. In this case the RAN node maintains
a second, separate mapping table between value (V) and CN node for \"UEs
configured for low access priority\".
If the selected CN node is not available or if no CN node address is
configured in the RNC for the requested NRI or if the provided identity
contains no NRI then the RNC routes the initial NAS signalling message to a CN
node selected from the available CN nodes which serve the related domain (CS
or PS). The selection mechanism is implementation dependent and should enable
load balancing between the available CN nodes. In some networks, the RNC may
be configured to select the MSC/VLR for \"UEs configured for low access
priority\" with a different load balance to that used for MSC/VLR selection
for other UEs.
NOTE 1: A routing-area update after SRNS relocation is not an initial NAS
signalling message, thus it is routed along the existing Iu-connection to the
SGSN.
NOTE 2: The RAN can determine whether or not the \"MS is configured for low
access priority\" from information received in the RRC establishment
signalling.
In case a MSC sends a paging with IMSI (i.e. the paging message does not
contain a TMSI), the RNC may, for purposes to increase the paging success
rate, upon reception temporarily store the Global-CN-ID of the node that
issued the paging message. If the MSC/VLR initiates the paging procedure via
Gs-interface the SGSN has to add the Global-CN-ID to the paging message.
### 5.2.1 Load Re-Distribution function in RNC
When the RNC receives a message with a \'null-NRI\' it uses the NAS Node
Selection Function for selecting a CN node where to forward the message. CN
node(s) with re-distribution in progress should be excluded from the NAS Node
Selection algorithm in the RNC. This is done by O&M configuration in the RNC.
In network configurations using MOCN network sharing, the RNC is preconfigured
with a null-NRI for each CN Operator in the MOCN. The RNC selects a CN node
belonging to a CN Operator based on what \'null-NRI\' is received.
## 5.3 BSC Functions
### 5.3.1 A interface mode
The BSC provides the NAS Node Selection Function. It is aware whenever a new
RR connection is established. In particular, the BSC always examines the
content of the Initial Layer 3 message sent by the MS in order to determine
the position of the MS Classmark and to extract its contents. The examination
of the Initial Layer 3 message content allows the BSC to observe the TMSI+LAI
or IMSI or IMEI.
The BSC derives from Initial Layer 3 messages the NRI from the TMSI. It is
configured in the BSC (O&M) which bits of the TMSI are significant for the
NRI. The BSC routes the Initial Layer 3 message according to the NRI to the
relevant MSC if an MSC address is configured in the BSC for the specific NRI.
The association between NRI values and MSC addresses is configured in the BSC
(O&M).
If no MSC address is configured in the BSC for the requested NRI, or if no
TMSI is sent by the MS (e.g. an IMSI or IMEI), then the BSC routes the initial
NAS signalling message to an MSC selected from the available MSCs. In
addition, the BSC may route the initial NAS signalling message to an MSC
selected from the available MSCs if this message is a Location Update Request
messages and the PLMN ID in the LAI is not one of the PLMN IDs served by the
BSC (FFS). The selection mechanism is implementation dependent and should
enable load balancing between the available MSCs. In some networks, the BSC
may be configured to select the MSC/VLR for \"MSs configured for low access
priority\" with a different load balance to that used for MSC/VLR selection
for other MSs.
NOTE: The BSC can determine whether or not the \"MS is configured for low
access priority\" from information contained in the Initial Layer 3 message.
Using a different load balance for \"MSs configured for low access priority\"
might be useful if some MSCs have a particularly large VLR capacity compared
to their relative processing power.
In case a MSC sends a paging-request with IMSI, the NAS node selection
function in the BSC shall upon reception temporarily store the MSC/VLR-
identity of the node that issued the paging-request message.
### 5.3.2 Gb mode
The BSC provides the NAS Node Selection Function. The MS sends the TLLI to the
BSC. The NRI is part of the P-TMSI and therefore also contained in the \'local
TLLI\' or in the \'foreign TLLI\'. The number of bits out of the TLLI which
are significant for the NRI is configured in the BSC (O&M).
A \'local TLLI\' indicates to the BSC that the TLLI is derived from a P-TMSI
which was assigned for the current RA, i.e. the \'local TLLI\' contains an NRI
which is valid for routing to an SGSN. A \'foreign TLLI\' indicates to the BSC
that the TLLI is derived from a P-TMSI which was assigned for another RA than
the current RA. The BSC does not know whether the other RA and therefore the
related P-TMSI belongs to the same pool-area or not unless this is configured
in the BSC (which is not intended). Consequently, the BSC assumes, that the
\'foreign TLLI\' contains a NRI which is valid for routing to an SGSN.
For \'local TLLIs\' and for \'foreign TLLIs\' the BSC masks the NRI out of the
TLLI. The BSC routes the uplink LLC frame to the relevant SGSN if an SGSN
address is configured in the BSC for the specific NRI. The association between
NRI values and SGSN addresses is configured in the BSC (O&M).
If no SGSN address is configured in the BSC for the requested NRI, which may
happen for NRIs masked out of a \'foreign TLLI\', or if the BSC received a
\'random TLLI\' which contains no NRI at all then the RNC routes the uplink
LLC frame to an SGSN selected from the available SGSNs. The selection
mechanism is implementation dependent and should enable load balancing between
the available SGSNs. In some networks, the BSC may be configured to select the
SGSN for \"MSs configured for low access priority\" with a different load
balance to that used for SGSN selection for other MSs. In this case, until
TLLI re-allocation occurs, the BSC shall remember which TLLIs are from \"MSs
configured for low access priority\" and which are not.
NOTE 1: For the selection mechanism in the BSC it is probably sufficient, that
the algorithm is \'slow moving\'. If the selection algorithm changes the SGSN
to be assigned for \'random TLLIs\' or for \'foreign TLLIs\' whose NRI value
is not used in the current SGSN pool area during a MS\'s Attach procedure or
RA update procedure, then the Attach procedure or RA update procedure is
likely to fail, but the MS will reattempt the procedure at T3310/T3330 expiry
(=15 seconds).
NOTE 2: The BSC can determine whether or not the \"MS is configured for low
access priorityC\" from information contained in the RR Channel Request
message.
NOTE 3: When performing special SGSN selection for \"MSs configured for low
access priority\", it is necessary to ensure that all the Mobility Management
signalling for that MS is routed to that special SGSN and not routed to any
other SGSN. Hence the requirement for the BSC to remember the \"TLLI to SGSN\"
relationship until the new SGSN has reallocated the TLLI.
As more than one SGSN may send downlink data at the same time for a cell or a
BVCI, the BSC has to share the total possible downlink traffic between the
SGSNs that can access a cell. The BSC should use the existing flow control
procedure on cell level to control each of the SGSNs in a way not to violate
the total possible traffic for the cell. How the BSC decides to share the
downlink traffic between each of the SGSNs is an implementation specific
issue; e.g. the possible downlink traffic can be equally shared between the
SGSNs, or the share of each SGSN can be proportional to the capacity of the
SGSN. In case a MSC sends a paging-request with IMSI via Gs-interface the SGSN
has to add the MSC/VLR-identity to the paging-request message. The NAS node
selection function in the BSC/RNC shall upon reception temporarily store the
MSC/VLR-identity.
### 5.3.3 Iu mode
To support MSs in Iu mode the BSC provides the same functionality as described
under \"RNC Functions\".
### 5.3.4 Load Re-Distribution function in BSC
When the BSC receives a message with a \'null-NRI\' it uses the NAS Node
Selection Function for selecting a CN node where to forward the message. This
is also done for all messages with \'random TLLIs\' (Gb-mode). CN node(s) with
re-distribution in progress should be excluded from the NAS Node Selection
algorithm in the BSC. This is done by O&M configuration in the BSC.
## 5.4 MSC Functions
### 5.4.1 TMSI Allocation
Every MSC is configured with its one or more specific NRI (O&M). One of these
specific NRIs is part of every temporary identity (TMSI) which the MSC assigns
to an MS. The TMSI allocation mechanism in the MSC generates TMSIs which
contain one of the specific NRIs in the relevant bit positions. An NRI has a
flexible length between 10 and 0 bits (0 bits means the NRI is not used and
the feature is not applied). The use of the bits not used to encode the NRI is
implementation dependent (e.g. to extent the TMSI space). An MSC applying
"Intra Domain Connection of RAN nodes to multiple CN nodes" shall allocate
TMSIs to the served MSs.
### 5.4.2 Mobility Management and Handover/Relocation
For MAP signalling between two MSCs which both support the Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes the new MSC derives the address
of the old MSC from the old LAI and the NRI contained in the old TMSI. The MSC
addresses for each LAI and NRI combination are configured in the MSC (O&M). If
the network contains MSCs that cannot derive the old MSC from LAI
[and]{.underline} NRI the default MSC per LAI as described below shall be used
(e.g. to reduce the configuration effort). Some redundancy may be required as
the default MSC is a single point of failure.
The load balancing between multiple target MSCs at handover/relocation into a
pool area is described in \"4.5 Load Balancing\". The handover/relocation from
an MSC that supports the Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN
Nodes to an MSC not supporting the feature needs no new functionality, as
there is only one MSC that serves the handover/relocation target.
### 5.4.3 Backward Compatibility and Default MSC
If a default MSC that is serving a pool-area receives MAP signalling (e.g. to
fetch the IMSI or to get unused cipher parameters) it has to resolve the
ambiguity of the multiple MSCs per LAI by deriving the NRI from the TMSI. The
MSC relays the MAP signalling to the old MSC identified by the NRI in the old
TMSI unless the default MSC itself is the old MSC. For every NRI value that is
used in the pool-area an MSC address is configured in the default MSC (O&M).
NOTE: It might be required to keep information on ongoing MAP dialogues in the
default MSC.
### 5.4.4 Support of Combined Procedures
If the SGSN does not support the Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to
Multiple CN Nodes then only one default out of the MSCs serving the related LA
can be used for the combined procedures. A relaying or diverting from the
default MSC to another is FFS. Distributing the associations of the combined
procedures according to the LAs would result in MSC changes when the MS is
still in the old MSC service area.
### 5.4.5 Load Re-Distribution function in MSC
The MSC needs to ensure that the RR-connection is released immediately after
the Location Update response message is returned to the UE, i.e. the follow-on
proceed flag shall be cleared.
For the special case when an MSC in a pool also serves a BSC or RNC that is
not part of the pool (e.g. a BSC or RNC that does not support pool
functionality), an MSC should not try to re-distribute UEs connected to that
BSC or RNC.
## 5.5 SGSN Functions
### 5.5.1 P-TMSI Allocation
Every SGSN is configured with its specific one or more NRI (O&M). One of these
specific NRIs is part of every temporary identity (P-TMSI) which the SGSN
assigns to an MS. The P-TMSI allocation mechanism in the SGSN generates
P-TMSIs which contain one of the specific NRIs in the relevant bit positions.
An NRI has a flexible length between 10 and 0 bits (0 bits means the NRI is
not used and the feature is not applied). The use of the bits not used to
encode the NRI is implementation dependent (e.g. to extent the TMSI space). An
SGSN applying "Intra Domain Connection of RAN nodes to multiple CN nodes"
shall allocate P-TMSIs to the served MSs.
### 5.5.2 Mobility Management and Handover/Relocation
For the GTP signalling between two SGSNs supporting the Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes the new SGSN derives the address
of the old SGSN from the old RAI and the NRI contained in the old P-TMSI/TLLI.
The SGSN addresses are configured in the SGSN (O&M) or in DNS for each RAI and
NRI combination. If the network contains SGSNs that cannot derive the old SGSN
from RAI and NRI the default SGSN per RAI as described below shall be used
(e.g. to reduce the configuration effort).
The load balancing between multiple target SGSNs at handover/relocation into a
pool area is described in \"4.5: Load Balancing\". The handover/relocation
from an SGSN that supports the Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to
Multiple CN Nodes to an SGSN not supporting the feature needs no new
functionality, as there is only one SGSN that serves the handover/relocation
target.
### 5.5.3 Backward Compatibility and Default SGSN
If a default SGSN that is serving a pool-area receives GTP signalling (e.g. to
fetch the IMSI or to get unused cipher parameters) it has to resolve the
ambiguity of the multiple SGSNs per RAI by deriving the NRI from the P-TMSI.
The SGSN relays the GTP signalling to the old SGSN identified by the NRI in
the old P-TMSI unless the default SGSN itself is the old SGSN. For every NRI
value that is used in the pool-area an SGSN address is configured in the
relaying SGSN (O&M) or in DNS.
NOTE: It might be required to keep information on ongoing GTP dialogues in the
default SGSN.
### 5.5.4 Support of Combined Procedures
The SGSN has to select an MSC at the Gs interface for the combined procedures
if multiple MSCs are configured for the relevant LAI. The MSC out of the
available MSCs is selected based on the TMSI based NRI as provided by the UE
or on the IMSI, and optionally, whether the \"MS is configured for low access
priority\". Use of the TMSI based NRI as provided by the UE prevents an MSC
change for UEs when UEs register first via normal procedures, and later by
combined procedures. Use of the TMSI based NRI as provided by the UE or IMSI
hash prevents an MSC change for many MSs if an SGSN fails and the re-attaching
MSs would get assigned another MSC by the new SGSN. Two HLR updates instead of
one would be the result.
From the LAI and the TMSI based NRI as provided by the UE, the SGSN can select
a VLR from the available VLRs. The NRI length and the selected VLR per NRI
value shall be the same as for the CN Node selection for the CS Domain in the
RNC and BSC nodes.
From the IMSI the SGSN derives a value (V) using algorithm [(IMSI div 10)
modulo 1000]. Every value (V) from the range 0 to 999 corresponds to a single
MSC node. Typically many values of (V) may point to the same MSC node. The
configuration of the MSC node should be the same in the same RNC area.
In some networks, the SGSN may be configured to select the MSC/VLR for \"MSs
configured for low access priority\" with a different load balance to that
used for MSC/VLR selection for other UEs. In this case the SGSN maintains a
second set of tables of NRI to MSC mappings, and of value (V) to MSC mappings.
### 5.5.5 CS Paging
If a CS paging is received via the Gs interface from MSC with mobile identity
type IMSI then the SGSN should include the MSC/VLR-id in the paging / paging-
request message to RNC/BSC.
### 5.5.6 Load Re-Distribution function in SGSN
On the Iu-ps interface the SGSN needs to ensure that the Iu-connection is
released immediately after the Routing Area Update response message is
returned to the UE, i.e. the follow-on flag shall be cleared.
On the Gb interface the SGSN needs to force the UE to standby after the
Routing Area Update response message is returned to the UE, i.e. the force to
standby indication shall be set. This ensures the Periodic Routing Area Update
timer to start as quickly as possible.
For the special case when an SGSN in a pool also serves a BSC or RNC that is
not part of the pool (e.g. a BSC or RNC that does not support pool
functionality), an SGSN should not try to re-distribute UEs connected to that
BSC or RNC.
# 6 Application Examples
This clause describes some application examples for networks using the intra
domain NAS node selection. In these examples, pool-areas are depicted by boxes
or ellipses, while the core network elements which serve the pool-areas are
depicted by the NRIs they have been assigned.
## 6.1 Network configuration example 1
This example configures 9 pool-areas each with 3 CN nodes serving within a
pool-area. When a MS moves from one (NRI:1,2,3) to another pool-area
(NRI:4,5,6). It indicates the old NRI (3) derived from its old TMSI to the RNC
in the new pool-area (NRI:4,5,6). This NRI 3 is not configured in the RNC of
the pool-area (NRI:4,5,6). The RNC selects a CN node out of the available NRIs
4,5,6 and establishes the signalling connection for the MS with the selected
CN node. This new CN nodes allocates a new TMSI to the MS and thereby the new
NRI for the new pool-area.
In this example, the NRIs can be re-used in a pattern where adjacent pool
areas do not use the same NRI. Every pool area change will initiate a new
selection of a new CN node.

Figure 2: Network configuration example 1
## 6.2 Network configuration example 2
This example shows a network covering one city centre surrounded by
residential areas. The city centre is covered by all 4 pool-areas while each
of the residential areas is covered by one pool-area only. Once a MS â€žfound\"
its pool-area, it will not change the pool-area while commuting between the
city centre and its residential area. Each of the pool-areas is served by 5
MSCs, indicated by the 5 NRI values in the figure below, which share the load
within the pool-area. Only distinct NRI values are used for the overlapping
pool-areas. Therefore, a MS changing between these pool-areas will always be
allocated to a new MSC by the NAS node selection function. In addition it is
shown, that the NRIs can be re-used in other pool-areas as indicated in the
figure by the smaller areas with only one NRI. Also at a change to these areas
the MSs will always be allocated to a new MSC by the NAS node selection
function as adjacent areas do not use the same NRI values.
A calculation for the possible number of subscribers in this scenario is in
Annex A.1: One city centre surrounded by residential areas

# 7 Specific Examples
This chapter describes specific examples of Iu Flex. First, building blocks of
Iu Flex are described in 7.1. These building blocks are then used in
signalling flows starting from 7.2.
The changes to the signalling flows are indicated in _italic._
## 7.1 Building blocks for signalling flows
### 7.1.1 RAN node selecting CN node in A interface mode
### 7.1.2 RAN node selecting CN node in Gb interface mode
### 7.1.3 RAN node selecting CN node in Iu interface mode
### 7.1.4 New CN node selecting old CN node
This building block describes how a new CN node selects the old CN node which
was previously serving the MS. The new CN node has been allocated to serve the
MS, and it may have to communicate with the old CN node e.g. in order to get
IMSI of the MS or to get MM and PDP contexts of the MS.
### 7.1.5 Old CN node selecting new CN node
This building block describes how the old CN node selects a new CN node which
starts to serve the MS. The old CN node has to select a new CN node e.g. when
performing handover.
### 7.1.6 SGSN selecting MSC
## 7.2 Signalling flow for Attach (Iu interface mode)
At attach, the RNC selects an SGSN to serve the MS. The attach procedure is
shown in the figure below.
{width="6.690277777777778in" height="7.386111111111111in"}
Figure 4: Signalling flow for Attach (Iu interface mode)
1) The Attach Request (old P-TMSI, old RAI, old P-TMSI Signature) is carried
in the Initial Direct Transfer message (RRC) from the MS to the RNC. The RNC
selects an SGSN to serve the MS as described in clause 7.1.3 and relays the
Attach Request to the SGSN in the Initial UE message (RANAP).
2) If the MS identifies itself with Pâ€‘TMSI and the SGSN has changed since
detach, the new SGSN sends an Identification Request (Pâ€‘TMSI, old RAI, old
Pâ€‘TMSI Signature) to the old SGSN to request the IMSI. The new SGSN selects
the old SGSN as described in clause 7.1.4. The old SGSN responds with
Identification Response (IMSI, Authentication Triplets (for GPRS) or
Authentication Vectors (for UMTS)). If the MS is not known in the old SGSN,
the old SGSN responds with an appropriate error cause. The old SGSN also
validates the old Pâ€‘TMSI Signature and responds with an appropriate error
cause if it does not match the value stored in the old SGSN.
3) If the MS is unknown in both the old and new SGSN, the SGSN sends an
Identity Request (Identity Type = IMSI) to the MS. The MS responds with
Identity Response (IMSI).
4) The authentication functions are defined in the clause \"Security
Function\" of TS 23.060 [2]. If no MM context for the MS exists anywhere in
the network, then authentication is mandatory. Ciphering procedures are
described in clause \"Security Function\" of TS 23.060 [2]. If Pâ€‘TMSI
allocation is going to be done and the network supports ciphering, the network
shall set the ciphering mode.
5) The equipment checking functions are defined in the clause \"Identity Check
Procedures\" of TS 23.060 [2]. Equipment checking is optional.
6) If the SGSN number has changed since the GPRS detach, or if it is the very
first attach, then the SGSN informs the HLR:
a) The SGSN sends an Update Location (SGSN Number, SGSN Address, IMSI) to the
HLR.
b) The HLR sends Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation Type) to the old SGSN
with Cancellation Type set to Update Procedure.
c) The old SGSN acknowledges with Cancel Location Ack (IMSI). If there are any
ongoing procedures for that MS, the old SGSN shall wait until these procedures
are finished before removing the MM and PDP contexts.
d) The HLR sends Insert Subscriber Data (IMSI, GPRS Subscription Data) to the
new SGSN.
e) The new SGSN validates the MS\'s presence in the (new) RA. If due to
regional subscription restrictions the MS is not allowed to attach in the RA,
the SGSN rejects the Attach Request with an appropriate cause, and may return
an Insert Subscriber Data Ack (IMSI, SGSN Area Restricted) message to the HLR.
If subscription checking fails for other reasons, the SGSN rejects the Attach
Request with an appropriate cause and returns an Insert Subscriber Data Ack
(IMSI, Cause) message to the HLR. If all checks are successful then the SGSN
constructs an MM context for the MS and returns an Insert Subscriber Data Ack
(IMSI) message to the HLR.
f) The HLR acknowledges the Update Location message by sending an Update
Location Ack to the SGSN after the cancelling of old MM context and insertion
of new MM context are finished. If the Update Location is rejected by the HLR,
the SGSN rejects the Attach Request from the MS with an appropriate cause.
7) If Attach Type in step 1 indicated GPRS Attach while already IMSI attached,
or combined GPRS / IMSI attached, then the VLR shall be updated if the Gs
interface is installed. The VLR number is determined as described in 7.1.6.
The SGSN starts the location update procedure towards the new MSC/VLR upon
receipt of the first Insert Subscriber Data message from the HLR in step 6d).
This operation marks the MS as GPRS-attached in the VLR.
a) The SGSN sends a Location Update Request (new LAI, IMSI, SGSN Number,
Location Update Type) message to the VLR. Location Update Type shall indicate
IMSI attach if Attach Type indicated combined GPRS / IMSI attach. Otherwise,
Location Update Type shall indicate normal location update. The VLR creates an
association with the SGSN by storing SGSN Number.
b) If the LA update is inter-MSC, the new VLR sends Update Location (IMSI, new
VLR) to the HLR.
c) If the LA update is inter-MSC, the HLR sends a Cancel Location (IMSI) to
the old VLR.
d) The old VLR acknowledges with Cancel Location Ack (IMSI).
e) If the LA update is inter-MSC, the HLR sends Insert Subscriber Data (IMSI,
GSM subscriber data) to the new VLR.
f) The VLR acknowledges with Insert Subscriber Data Ack (IMSI).
g) After finishing the inter-MSC location update procedures, the HLR responds
with Update Location Ack (IMSI) to the new VLR.
h) The VLR responds with Location Update Accept (VLR TMSI) to the SGSN. An Iu
Flex aware VLR includes one of its (CS-)NRIs as part of VLR TMSI. The SGSN
creates an association with the VLR by storing VLR number.
8) The SGSN selects Radio Priority SMS, and sends an Attach Accept (Pâ€‘TMSI,
VLR TMSI, Pâ€‘TMSI Signature, Radio Priority SMS) message to the MS. Pâ€‘TMSI is
included if the SGSN allocates a new Pâ€‘TMSI. An Iu Flex aware SGSN includes
one of its (PS-)NRIs as part of P-TMSI.
9) If Pâ€‘TMSI or VLR TMSI was changed, the MS acknowledges the received TMSI(s)
by returning an Attach Complete message to the SGSN.
10) If VLR TMSI was changed, the SGSN confirms the VLR TMSI re-allocation by
sending a TMSI Reallocation Complete message to the VLR.
## 7.3 Signalling flows for Service Request (Iu interface mode)
When performing service request, the signalling connection between the MS and
the SGSN is re-established.
### 7.3.1 Service Request initiated by MS
The service request procedure initiated by the MS is shown in the figure
below.
{width="6.239583333333333in" height="3.6354166666666665in"}
Figure 5: Signalling flows for Service Request initiated by MS (Iu interface
mode)
1) The MS establishes an RRC connection, if none exists for CS traffic.
2) The MS sends a Service Request (Pâ€‘TMSI, RAI, CKSN, Service Type) message to
the SGSN. Service Type specifies the requested service. Service Type shall
indicate one of the following: Data or Signalling. The Service Request is
carried in the Initial Direct Transfer message (RRC) from the MS to the RNC.
The RNC selects an SGSN to serve the MS as described in 7.1.3 and relays the
Service Request to the SGSN in the Initial UE message (RANAP). At this point,
the SGSN may perform the authentication procedure.
\- If Service Type indicates Data, a signalling connection is established
between the MS and the SGSN, and resources for active PDP context(s) are
allocated, i.e., RAB establishment for the activated PDP context(s).
\- If Service Type indicates Signalling, the signalling connection is
established between the MS and the SGSN for sending upper-layer signalling
messages, e.g., Activate PDP Context Request. The resources for active PDP
context(s) are not allocated.
3) The SGSN shall perform the security functions if the MS in PMM-IDLE state
initiated the service request.
4) If the network is in PMM-CONNECTED state and the Service Type indicates
Data, the SGSN shall respond with a Service Accept message towards the MS, in
case the service request can be accepted. In case Service Type indicates Data,
the SGSN sends a Radio Access Bearer Assignment Request (NSAPIRAB ID(s),
TEID(s), QoS Profile(s), SGSN IP Address(es)) message to re-establish radio
access bearer for every activated PDP context.
5) The RNC indicates to the MS the new Radio Bearer Identity established and
the corresponding RAB ID with the RRC radio bearer setup procedure.
6) SRNC responds with the Radio Access Bearer Assignment Response (RAB ID(s),
TEID(s), QoS Profile(s), RNC IP Address(es)) message. The GTP tunnel(s) are
established on the Iu interface. If the RNC returns a Radio Access Bearer
Assignment Response message with a cause indicating that the requested QoS
profile(s) can not be provided, e.g., \"Requested Maximum Bit Rate not
Available\", the SGSN may send a new Radio Access Bearer Assignment Request
message with different QoS profile(s). The number of re-attempts, if any, as
well as how the new QoS profile(s) values are determined is implementation
dependent.
7) For each RAB re-established with a modified QoS profile, the SGSN initiates
a PDP Context Modification procedure to inform the MS and the GGSN of the new
negotiated QoS profile for the corresponding PDP context.
8) The MS sends the uplink packet.
### 7.3.2 Service Request initiated by network
The service request procedure initiated by the network is shown in the figure
below.
{width="6.4375in" height="4.71875in"}
Figure 6: Signalling flows for Service Request initiated by network (Iu
interface mode)
1) The SGSN receives a downlink PDP PDU for an MS in PMMâ€‘IDLE state.
2) The SGSN sends a Paging message to the RNC. The RNC pages the MS by sending
a Paging message to the MS. See clause \"PS Paging Initiated by 3Gâ€‘SGSN
without RRC Connection for CS\" of TS 23.060 [2] for details.
3) The MS establishes an RRC connection if none exists for CS traffic.
4) The MS sends a Service Request (Pâ€‘TMSI, RAI, CKSN, Service Type) message to
the SGSN. Service Type specifies Paging Response. The Service Request is
carried over the radio in an RRC Direct Transfer message. The RNC selects an
SGSN to serve the MS as described in 7.1.3 and relays the Service Request to
the SGSN in the Initial UE message (RANAP). At this point, the SGSN may
perform the authentication procedure. The SGSN knows whether the downlink
packet requires RAB establishment (e.g., downlink PDU) or not (e.g., Request
PDP Context Activation or MT SMS).
5) The SGSN shall perform the security mode procedure.
6) If resources for the PDP contexts are re-established, the SGSN sends a
Radio Access Bearer Assignment Request (RAB ID(s), TEID(s), QoS Profile(s),
SGSN IP Address(es)) message to the RNC. The RNC sends a Radio Bearer Setup
(RAB ID(s)) to the MS. The MS responds by returning a Radio Bearer Setup
Complete message to the RNC. The RNC sends a Radio Access Bearer Assignment
Response (RAB ID(s), TEID(s), RNC IP Address(es)) message to the SGSN in order
to indicate that GTP tunnels are established on the Iu interface and radio
access bearers are established between the RNC and the MS. If the RNC returns
a Radio Access Bearer Assignment Response message with a cause indicating that
the requested QoS profile(s) can not be provided, e.g., \"Requested Maximum
Bit Rate not Available\", the SGSN may send a new Radio Access Bearer
Assignment Request message with different QoS profile(s). The number of re-
attempts, if any, as well as how the new QoS profile(s) values are determined
is implementation dependent.
7) For each RAB re-established with a modified QoS profile, the SGSN initiates
a PDP Context Modification procedure to inform the MS and the GGSN of the new
negotiated QoS profile for the corresponding PDP context.
8) The SGSN sends the downlink packet.
## 7.4 Signalling flow for Routing Area Update (Iu interface mode)
The routing area update procedure is shown in the figure below.
{width="6.71875in" height="9.416666666666666in"}
Figure 7: Signalling flow for Routing Area Update (Iu interface mode)
1) The RRC connection is established, if not already done. The Routeing Area
Update Request (old P-TMSI, old RAI, old P-TMSI Signature) is carried in the
Initial Direct Transfer message (RRC) from the MS to the RNC. The RNC selects
an SGSN to serve the MS as described in 7.1.3 and relays the Routeing Area
Update Request to the SGSN in the Initial UE message (RANAP).
2) If the RA update is an Inter-SGSN Routeing area update and if the MS was in
PMMâ€‘IDLE state, the new SGSN sends an SGSN Context Request message (old
Pâ€‘TMSI, old RAI, old Pâ€‘TMSI Signature) to the old SGSN to get the MM and PDP
contexts for the MS. The new SGSN selects the old SGSN as described in 7.1.4.
The old SGSN validates the old Pâ€‘TMSI Signature and responds with an
appropriate error cause if it does not match the value stored in the old SGSN.
This should initiate the security functions in the new SGSN. If the security
functions authenticate the MS correctly, the new SGSN shall send an SGSN
Context Request (IMSI, old RAI, MS Validated) message to the old SGSN. MS
Validated indicates that the new SGSN has authenticated the MS. If the old
Pâ€‘TMSI Signature was valid or if the new SGSN indicates that it has
authenticated the MS, the old SGSN responds with SGSN Context Response (Cause,
IMSI, MM Context, PDP contexts). If the MS is not known in the old SGSN, the
old SGSN responds with an appropriate error cause. The old SGSN starts a
timer. The new SGSN shall ignore the MS Network Capability contained in MM
Context of SGSN Context Response only when it has previously received an MS
Network Capability in the Routeing Area Request.
a) If the MS is PMMâ€‘CONNECTED in the old 3Gâ€‘SGSN, the old SGSN shall send an
SRNS Context Request (IMSI) message to the old SRNS to retrieve the sequence
numbers for the PDP context for inclusion in the SGSN Context Response message
from the SRNS. Upon reception of this message, the SRNS buffers and stops
sending downlink PDUs to the MS and returns an SRNS Context Response (IMSI,
GTPâ€‘SNDs, GTPâ€‘SNUs, PDCPâ€‘SNUs) message. The SRNS shall include for each PDP
context the next in-sequence GTP sequence number to be sent to the MS and the
GTP sequence number of the next uplink PDU to be tunnelled to the GGSN. For
each active PDP context using acknowledged mode, the SRNS also includes the
uplink PDCP sequence number (PDCPâ€‘SNU). PDCPâ€‘SNU shall be the next in-sequence
PDCP sequence number expected from the MS (per each active radio bearer).
3) Security functions may be executed. These procedures are defined in clause
\"Security Function\" of TS 23.060 [2]. If the security functions do not
authenticate the MS correctly, the routeing area update shall be rejected, and
the new SGSN shall send a reject indication to the old SGSN. The old SGSN
shall continue as if the SGSN Context Request was never received.
4) If the RA update is an Inter-SGSN Routeing area update, the new SGSN sends
an SGSN Context Acknowledge message to the old SGSN. The old SGSN marks in its
context that the MSC/VLR association and the information in the GGSNs and the
HLR are invalid. This triggers the MSC/VLR, the GGSNs, and the HLR to be
updated if the MS initiates a routeing area update procedure back to the old
SGSN before completing the ongoing routeing area update procedure.
5) If the RA update is an Inter-SGSN RA Update and if the MS was in PMMâ€‘IDLE
state, the new SGSN sends Update PDP Context Request (new SGSN Address, QoS
Negotiated, Tunnel Endpoint Identifier) to the GGSNs concerned. The GGSNs
update their PDP context fields and return an Update PDP Context Response
(Tunnel Endpoint Identifier). Note: If the RA update is an Inter-SGSN routeing
area update initiated by an MS in PMMâ€‘CONNECTED state, the Update PDP Context
Request message is sent as described in clause \"Serving RNS Relocation
Procedures\" of TS 23.060 [2].
6) If the RA update is an Inter-SGSN RA Update, the new SGSN informs the HLR
of the change of SGSN by sending Update Location (SGSN Number, SGSN Address,
IMSI) to the HLR.
7) If the RA update is an inter-SGSN RA Update, the HLR sends Cancel Location
(IMSI, Cancellation Type) to the old SGSN with Cancellation Type set to Update
Procedure. If the timer described in step 2 is not running, the old SGSN
removes the MM context. Otherwise, the contexts are removed only when the
timer expires. It also ensures that the MM context is kept in the old SGSN in
case the MS initiates another inter SGSN routeing area update before
completing the ongoing routeing area update to the new SGSN. The old SGSN
acknowledges with Cancel Location Ack (IMSI).
a) If the MS is PMMâ€‘CONNECTED in the old 3Gâ€‘SGSN, the old 3Gâ€‘SGSN sends an Iu
Release Command message to the old SRNC. The SRNC responds with an Iu Release
Complete message.
8) If the RA update is an inter-SGSN RA Update, the HLR sends Insert
Subscriber Data (IMSI, subscription data) to the new SGSN. The new SGSN
validates the MS\'s presence in the (new) RA. If due to regional subscription
restrictions the MS is not allowed to be attached in the RA, the SGSN rejects
the Routeing Area Update Request with an appropriate cause, and may return an
Insert Subscriber Data Ack (IMSI, SGSN Area Restricted) message to the HLR. If
all checks are successful, the SGSN constructs an MM context for the MS and
returns an Insert Subscriber Data Ack (IMSI) message to the HLR.
9) If the RA update is an Inter-SGSN RA Update, the HLR acknowledges the
Update Location by sending Update Location Ack (IMSI) to the new SGSN.
10) If Update Type indicates combined RA / LA update with IMSI attach
requested, or if the LA changed with the routeing area update, the association
has to be established _. The VLR number is determined as described in 7.1.6.
The new SGSN sends a Location Update Request (new LAI, IMSI, SGSN Number,
Location Update Type) to the VLR._ Location Update Type shall indicate IMSI
attach if Update Type in step 1 indicated combined RA / LA update with ISI
attach requested. Otherwise, Location Update Type shall indicate normal
location update. The SGSN starts the location update procedure towards the new
MSC/VLR upon receipt of the first Insert Subscriber Data message from the HLR
in step 8). The VLR creates or updates the association with the SGSN by
storing SGSN Number.
11) If the subscriber data in the VLR is marked as not confirmed by the HLR,
the new VLR informs the HLR. The HLR cancels the old VLR and inserts
subscriber data in the new VLR (this signalling is not modified from existing
GSM signalling and is included here for illustrative purposes):
a) The new VLR sends an Update Location (new VLR) to the HLR.
b) The HLR cancels the data in the old VLR by sending Cancel Location (IMSI)
to the old VLR.
c) The old VLR acknowledges with Cancel Location Ack (IMSI).
d) The HLR sends Insert Subscriber Data (IMSI, GSM subscriber data) to the new
VLR.
e) The new VLR acknowledges with Insert Subscriber Data Ack (IMSI).
f) The HLR responds with Update Location Ack (IMSI) to the new VLR.
12) The new VLR allocates a new TMSI and responds with Location Update Accept
(VLR TMSI) to the SGSN. VLR TMSI is optional if the VLR has not changed. An Iu
Flex aware VLR includes one of its (CS-)NRIs as part of VLR TMSI. The SGSN
creates an association with the VLR by storing VLR number.
13) The new SGSN validates the MS\'s presence in the new RA. If due to roaming
restrictions the MS is not allowed to be attached in the SGSN, or if
subscription checking fails, the SGSN rejects the routeing area update with an
appropriate cause. If all checks are successful, the new SGSN establishes MM
context for the MS. The new SGSN responds to the MS with Routeing Area Update
Accept (Pâ€‘TMSI, VLR TMSI, Pâ€‘TMSI Signature). An Iu Flex aware SGSN includes
one of its (PS-)NRIs as part of P-TMSI.
14) The MS confirms the reallocation of the TMSIs by returning a Routeing Area
Update Complete message to the SGSN.
15) The new SGSN sends a TMSI Reallocation Complete message to the new VLR if
the MS confirms the VLR TMSI.
## 7.5 IMSI attach procedure / Location area update with IMSI
This signalling flow shows the basic IMSI attach or location update procedure
when a UMTS UE registers to a pool-area by mobile identity type IMSI.
{width="5.363194444444445in" height="5.520138888888889in"}
Figure 8: IMSI attach procedure / Location area update with IMSI
1) UE requests the setup of the RRC connection and sends the Initial_DT
including the Intra Domain NAS Node Selector (IDNNS). The IDNNS indicates that
the routing parameter is derived from IMSI.
2) The RNC selects the MSC as described in 7.1.3. The Initial-UE message is
generated on RANAP and sent via Iu-CS to the selected MSC/VLR.
3) The optional security functions can be executed.
4) Since the UE wasn\'t registered in the MSC before the Map Update-location
procedure to HLR is invoked by the MSC:
a) The update-location is sent to HLR;
b) In case the UE was registered in another VLR the HLR sends cancel location
procedure to old VLR;
c) The old VLR acknowledges with Cancel location Ack;
d) The HLR sends insert-subscriber data to the new VLR;
e) The new VLR acknowledges with insert-subscriber data Ack;
f) After finishing the location update procedure the HLR responds with Update-
location to the new VLR.
5) The MSC/VLR assigns a new TMSI to the UE and sends this TMSI value in the
location-update accept to the UE. The TMSI contains the NRI of the VLR. The
location update accept is carried in the NAS-PDU of the RANAP direct-transfer
over Iu interface.
6) The RNC transparently forwards the NAS-PDU to the UE in the RRC downlink-DT
message.
7) In the UE the new TMSI (including the NRI) and the LA are stored on SIM and
the TMSI-reallocation complete is generated. This NAS message is returned to
CN in the Uplink-DT via RRC. The mobile shall use this new TMSI next time it
performs a mobile originating procedure.
8) The RNC forwards the NAS-PDU transparently to the MSC/VLR in the NAS-PDU of
a Direct-transfer on Iu interface. If the TMSI-reallocation complete is
received in the MSC/VLR the TMSI is considered as valid for the UE. From then
on the UE will be addressed using this TMSI value.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Network configuration examples
Editor\'s note: This annex contains the examples for network configurations
that have been discussed during the drafting meetings.
# A.1 One city centre surrounded by residential areas
## A.1.1 Assumptions
This example shows a network covering one city centre surrounded by
residential areas. The city centre is covered by all 4 pool-areas while the
residential areas are covered by one pool-area only. Once a subscriber
â€žfound\" its pool-area, he will not change the pool-area while commuting
between the city centre and his residential area.\ Each of the pool-areas is
served by 5 MSCs, indicated by the 5 NRI values in the figure below.
The example in the figure configures 4 overlapping pool-areas:
\- City centre with 12 Mio subscribers (with context in VLR, attached or
detached);
\- One switch office/building with 5 MSCs (5 NRIs) per pool-area;
\- Capacity of one MSC/VLR up to 1 Mio subscribers in VLR;
\- 4 bits are assumed for the VLR-restart counter;
\- Only distinct NRI values are used, so a UE changing between pool-areas will
always be allocated to a new MSC by the NAS node selection function.
{width="5.020138888888889in" height="3.7618055555555556in"}
Figure 9: One city centre surrounded by residential areas
## A.1.2. TMSI calculation
For addressing in the CS domain 30 bits for can be used (Bit 30&31 are
reserved):
\- The assumption is that 4 bits are used for the restart counter;
\- To differentiate the 20 MSC in the city area 5 bits are needed for the NRI
(12 NRI values remain unused; these 12 NRIs are left for additional MSCs in
the whole area, NRIs can also be re-used as indicated in the figure);
\- This leaves 30-4-5 = 21 bits for every MSC to address the subscriber data
records in the VLR. (This give address space for 2 Mio TMSIs unique over all
LAs of the MSC);
\- The 4 pool-areas sum up to 20 Mio subscriber, allowing for some unbalanced
load distribution.
# A.2 3 Neighbouring large city centres
This documents provides some calculations for \'pool-identification
alternative B\' in case that 3 huge city centres are covered by pool-areas
with direct contacts.
**Assumptions:**
The calculations are based on the following assumptions:
\- 3 neighbouring pools with capacity of 32 M non-purged subscribers each.
\- Maximum capacity of a paging channel is 1 M pagings/hour per LA.
\- 0.25 pagings / hour are assumed per subscriber ïƒ  2M TMSI/LA can be
realized.
\- For the \'VLR-restart\' counters a number of bits need to be reserved.
Working assumption is that 5 bit should be sufficient for any implementation,
in the examples these 5 bits are reserved on the upper part of the TMSI. (This
is of course implementation specific and not part of Iu Flex).
\- The calculations are based on a node capacity of up to 1M (2\^20) non-
purged subscribers this results in:
\- Minimum 32 nodes are needed per pool-area (5-bit NRI).
\- Minimum is 16 LA\'s per pool-area.
**Basic configuration needed for 1 pool:**
\- To address the 32M TMSI per pool the total number of 25 bits are needed in
the TMSI.
\- For a node capacity of 1M non-purged TMSIs 20 Bits have to be reserved for
TMSI per NRI and 5 bit for the NRI value.
\- The NRI is located bit 14-23 (configurable). It is assumed that the bits
19-23 are used for the NRI.

Figure 10: Example of a TMSI structure with 5 bit \'VLR-restart counter\' and
5 bits NRI-length
**\'3 pool configuration\' -- no sharing of NRI values:**
\- This example assumes that the 3 pool-areas have independent NRI values, so
the available TMSI range has to be shared between the pools. All TMSI\'s from
other pool-areas can be detected - best load distribution in the pools.
\- So 3*32 = 96 NRI values are needed for all 3 pools. The NRI-length has to
be increased to 7 bit. (not an optimum configuration since 32 NRI values are
unused). In the example the NRI now uses bits 23-17.
\- Since still for each NRI value 20 bits are needed to address 1M TMSIs there
is a conflict with the assumed VLR-restart field length of 5 bit. The VLR-
restart field has to be reduced to a 3 bit field in order to free sufficient
addressing space in the TMSI structure!

Figure 11: Modified TMSI structure 7 bits NRI-length; VLR-restart field must

\- In this example configuration 32M TMSI values are wasted! So it would be
more efficient to assign these TMSI ranges to the 3 pools rather than leave
them unused. Alternatively these values could be used for sharing with nodes
in the \'outside world\'.
\- The major drawback of this solution is the reduction of the VLR-restart
field to 3 bits only!
**\'3 pool configuration\' -- 25% of NRI values shared between the pools:**
\- Now the pool configurations are changed in a way that 25% of the NRI values
are the same in all the 3 pools. This means that for Â¼ of subscribers pool-
changes cannot be detected. The traffic generated by these subscribers will
not be distributed, but is routed by the NAS node selection function to the
specific node with this NRI value in the new pool.
\- The total range of needed NRI values is reduced by this to:\ 8 (the shared
NRI\'s) + 3 * 24 = 80
\- To code this NRI\'s still 7 bit are needed. So there is no gain in terms of
addressing space in this example.
\- In the example the NRI values 0..7 are shared and so are the TMSI ranges

**\'3 pool configuration\' -- 50% of NRI values shared between the pools:**
\- The percentage of the shared NRIs is now increased to 50%. So Â½ of the NRI
values are the same in all the 3 pools. This means that for Â½ of subscribers
pool-changes cannot be detected. The traffic generated by these subscribers
will not be distributed, but is routed by the NAS node selection function to
the specific node with this NRI value in the new pool.
\- The total range of needed NRI values is reduced by this to:\ 16 (the shared
NRI\'s) + 3 * 16 = 64.
\- This reduction of NRI saves 1 bit in NRI length. So the VLR-restart can be
slightly increased to 4 bit (still 1 bit less than in the original
assumption).

\- Next step is to even increase the shared part of the NRI to Â¾. This means
that only 25% of the incoming traffic in a pool-area is distributed.
\- The total range of needed NRI values is reduced by this to:\ 24 (the shared
NRI\'s) + 3 * 8 = 48.
\- Like the first step this doesn\'t free any addressing space in the TMSI.
But some NRI values are now available in case it is wanted to share them with
other nodes outside the \'3 pool area\'.
\- In the example the NRI values 0..23 are shared and so are the TMSI ranges

**\'3 pool configuration\' -- full sharing of NRIs between the pools:**
\- The last variant of these configurations is a full sharing is all NRI
values between all neighbouring pools. In this case no detection of pool area
changes is possible. Consequently no distribution of load can be achieved.
This results necessarily in the need to have a \'forced redistribution\'
mechanism to resolve heavy unbalance of load.
\- The NRI and TMSI ranges will then be the same as in the \'single pool\'
example in the beginning.
**Result:**
The examples above show that it is basically not possible to configure the
example configuration (32M non-purged subscribers; 1M per MSC) with a VLR-
restart field as put in the assumptions, except that the full range of NRI is
shared between the pools.\ Taking it literally it could be possible with 3
pools when sharing the remaining quarter of the NRI (the part that would be
unused otherwise), but latest if 4 pool-areas with this capacity have to be
supported this reaches the limit.
An alternative to overcome this could be to apply the TMSI\'s on a per LA
basis as it is already foreseen on the A/Iu interface specifications.
**TMSI per LA:**
Taking the example configuration mentioned above but changing the TMSI
allocation per LA would result in an increase of the addressing space. Then
the same TMSI value can be used multiple times in the same VLR. A specific
subscriber data record can then only be addressed by LA&TMSI.
For the 32 MSCs this means that that each of them supports an equal share of
TMSI of a LA. So each MSC handles 2M/32 = 32k TMSI of a specific LA.
The required TMSI addressing space id thereby reduced to 15 bit per MSC.
If, like before, 96 NRI values are needed to address all nodes in the 3 pools
then 7 bit are needed for this. This leaves 5 bit for the VLR-restart counters
(plus 3 unused bits).

Without sharing NRI values the pool size can even be increased (Factor 8 \--
since 3 bit spare).
A number of aspects however remain to be looked at with this TMSI per LA
approach:
\- It requires an equal distribution of UE\'s of a certain LA over all nodes
in the pool. This contradicts the wish for a flexible routing where e.g. a new
attach should be routed to the closest node in order to save transmission
resources.
\- Attach requests in a LA may be rejected by one node because this node has
already a fully booked TMSI table for this LA. At the same time the node may
have in total still capacity left to serve subscribers.
\- The total load of TMSI re-allocations may increase since every change of LA
must result in a TMSI reallocation.
\- MAP on VLR-VLR I/F must be updated, otherwise subscriber confidentially
decreases because for every change to other MSCs the IMSI has to be fetched
via the air I/F. (At the same time node changes should only occur when
changing the pool-area -- so maybe never?).
\- Can it happen that if NRI are shared there are several subscribers with the
same TMSI in a certain LA? FFS\ If yes then a paging-request there will
trigger several page-response messages per LA.
