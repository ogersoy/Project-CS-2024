# 4 Background
In the US, up to 194MHz is available for deployment of Band 41 based LTE TDD,
with often large contiguous (40MHz+) blocks of channels available. Further
details on the specific channel and frequency block arrangement of this band,
including the regulatory requirements, are provided in [3].
Many network equipment vendors are supporting, or planning to support, dual
carrier, 2x 20MHz TDD radios in the near future for the 2600MHz band.
Due to the spectrum and network equipment availability, Band 41 is a prime
candidate for deployment of Release 10 based LTE-advanced carrier aggregation
capable UEs.
This work item was initiated so that RAN4 could work on developing
specification support for contiguous, intra-band carrier aggregation for Band
41 to support deployment of LTE-advanced, building on the initial generic LTE
TDD CA work that is developing the framework for TDD intra-band carrier
aggregation based on Band 40.
## 4.1 Task description
The purpose of this WI is:
a. Building on the LTE intra-band CA work completed for Band 40, specify the
core RF requirements for contiguous intra-band CA in Band 41, specifically
considering aggregation of appropriate channel bandwidths up to:
i. 60MHz at the eNB;
ii. 40MHz at the UE with a maximum of 2 CCs on the DL and 1 or 2 CCs on the UL
b. Specify band specific RRM requirements
c. Study specific signalling support requirements in RAN2
d. Add the performance requirements for intra-band carrier aggregation for
Band 41 in the relevant specifications
Conformance testing aspects will be covered as part of a separate RAN5 WI.
## 4.2 Operating scenarios
Due to the way the EBS/BRS spectrum band is arranged in the USA [3],
aggregated channel bandwidths on the eNB side could comprise the scenarios
shown in Table 4.2-1.
Table 4.2-1. Likely carrier aggregation scenarios at the eNB in the EBS/BRS
band
+----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+ | Aggregated | Aggregated BW | eNB Component | Comment | | channels | | Carrier Config | | +----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+ | BRS2-H3 | 55.5MHz | 20+20+15 | All BRS | | | | (55MHz total) | (commercial) | | | | | channels in | | | | | the UBS | +----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+ | Two blocks | 33MHz | 20+10 (30MHz | All A & B | | | | total) OR | channels; all | | | | | B & C channels | | | | 15+15 (30MHz | etc | | | | total) | | +----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+ | Three blocks | 49.5MHz | 15+15+15 | Can fit | | | | (45MHz total) | 20+15+15 / | | | | OR 20+15+15 | 20+20+10 into | | | | (50MHz total) | 49.5MHz using | | | | OR | channel | | | | | spacing less | | | | 20+20+10 | than nominal | | | | (50MHz total) | Error: | | | | | Reference | | | | | source not | | | | | found | +----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+ | Four blocks | 66MHz | 20+20+20 | | | | | (60MHz total) | | +----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+ | All MBS | 42MHz | 20+20MHz | | | | | (40MHz total) | | +----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+
As it is proposed to study up to 60MHz at the eNB, all of these scenarios
would be in scope. At the eNB side each DL component carrier will have a
corresponding UL component carrier making the aggregated BW symmetric between
the DL and UL at the eNB.
From the UE perspective, for an eNB operating three component carriers, the UE
would only ever be aggregated on up to two adjacent carriers. According to
Table 4.2-1, support for the following component carrier aggregation scenarios
would therefore be required at the UE:
● 20+20MHz (40MHz)
● 15+15MHz (30MHz)
● 20+10MHz (30MHz)
● 20+15MHz (35MHz)
In summary, Band 41 CA capable UEs should ideally be able to support
aggregated channel bandwidths of 30, 35 and 40MHz.
At this time it is not proposed to further study support for 5MHz component
carriers in carrier aggregation scenarios, or aggregation scenarios that
result in aggregated channel bandwidths other than 30, 35 or 40MHz.
# 5 Study of E-UTRA requirements
## 5.1 Operating bands and channel bandwidths
### 5.1.1 Operating bands for CA
E-UTRA CA for Band 41 is defined to operate in the entire Band 41 range, as
defined in Table 5.1.1-1.

### 5.1.2 Channel bandwidths for CA
Table 5.1.2-1 defines the supported E-UTRA bandwidths for intra-band
contiguous CA in Band 41. As shown, only 10, 15 and 20 MHz component carrier
channel bandwidths are proposed to be supported in Band 41 carrier
aggregation.
On the UE side, only CA bandwidth class "C" is supported with a maximum number
of CCs for combination being two, enabling aggregated bandwidths of 30 and 40
MHz at the UE using symmetric CC BW configurations.

bandwidth should be considered. The maximum number of CCs for combination is

* * *
As defined for Band 40, combinations of component carriers with unequal
channel bandwidth should be considered for Band 41, specifically combinations
of 20 + 10 MHz and 20 + 15 MHz. Subclause 4.2 provides detail on operating
scenarios where such configurations may be required and it is proposed to
study if these CA combinations can be supported by the intra-band contiguous
CA framework developed in Rel-10 for TDD, in the form of Band 40 CA, without
significant changes.
It is also proposed to study if it is needed and beneficial to support the
case of a UE capable of 2 CC on the DL and 1 CC on the UL, based on the
discussion in subclause 4.2.
While eNB CA specifications have been developed to be aggregated bandwidth
independent, it is worth noting that aggregation of up to 60MHz is considered
to be supported at the eNB side with the downlink and uplink aggregated
bandwidth always being symmetric. This enables the eNB to use any two adjacent
component carriers for aggregating resources for allocation to a UE.
## 5.2 Supporting intra-band CA with 1 CC UL
### 5.2.1 Motivation
As identified in Section 4.1, it is proposed to consider the option to support
2 CC DL CA with either 1 CC or 2 CC UL at the UE.
The rationale for this is to potentially give some flexibility to UE vendors
regarding the trade-off between cost and performance, depending on the "type"
of UE and the applications or usage scenarios it may be targeted at
supporting. Especially if dual mode LTE FDD and LTE TDD CA capable baseband UE
chipsets are developed that do not support 2 CC UL because of the complexities
and cost associated with 2 CC UL for inter-band CA in LTE FDD.
It can be envisaged that UEs that support UL intensive applications, such as
devices with high definition cameras performing live video streaming, may
warrant the capability to support 2 CC UL. Conversely devices that are
focussed on the consumption of similar high definition media, such as portable
video players, may not require or benefit from support of 2 CC UL.
Furthermore, while all UEs could benefit from 2 CC DL in terms of maximum
achievable data rates (in theory they could be allocated all RBs anywhere in
the cell), only a smaller percentage of UEs could benefit from a data rate
increase due to 2 CC UL, as the extra RBs can only be allocated when the link
budget has sufficient margin, as such allocations will likely incur extra MPR
and possibly A-MPR. Therefore the benefit of supporting 2 CC UL in a UE may be
limited to the cases of when a cell is heavily UL loaded, and cross carrier
scheduling enables more effective load balancing across UL component carriers.
Even in this case the benefits could be limited if this results in multi-
cluster allocations and hence link budget restrictions.
Consequently, the need to support 2 CC UL may not be as great as 2 CC DL,
depending on the type of device and usage scenario, as well as the difference
in DL and UL load and traffic types.
In summary, when the above issues are considered, it may lead to some dual
mode LTE FDD and LTE TDD UE chipset solutions only supporting or warranting 1
CC UL.
### 5.2.2 Implementation implications
A UE that operates using 2 CC DL with 1 CC UL results in a different
aggregated bandwidth on the DL compared to that used on the UL transceiver
path.
For an FDD intra-band contiguous CA capable UE this is not a major problem as
the DL and UL paths will be dealt with independently, due to the duplex
spacing of the two carriers. However the situation is not so straightforward
for the TDD case, as naturally two different aggregated bandwidths across the
DL and UL would drive different local oscillator frequency requirements, and
this could lead to some challenges in transceiver design.
However it is not expected that the associated challenges are insurmountable,
and therefore, as there is an identified need, the RAN 4 specifications should
not limit UE vendors that can produce solutions due to a lack of specified
requirements.
### 5.2.3 Release 10 specification support
Release 10 RRC signalling specified in TS 36.331 enables independent
signalling of DL and UL CA capability and configuration. This enables a UE
that supports Bandwidth Class C on the DL to indicate it can only support
Bandwidth Class A on the UL and then be configured with the SCC (or SCell) as
DL only.
Such a configuration for intra-band CA is partially supported in TS 36.101
V10.4.0. All transmitter requirements and almost all receiver requirements
support 2 CC DL with 1 CC UL, except for reference sensitivity, maximum input
level and spurious response, where the DL requirement is specified only for
the case of a 2 CC UL configuration.
As partial support of 1 CC UL is a core CA maintenance issue and independent
of the Band 41 CA WI, it is expected that the UL configuration in the
identified receiver requirements will be clarified as part of Release 10
maintenance, such that they are defined in a similar manner as the receiver
requirements that support 1 CC UL. As a result no changes are required to the
core Release 10 specifications to enable support for 1 CC UL in Band 41.
## 5.3 Specific UE RF requirements
### 5.3.1 Spectrum emission mask
In the case when carriers are contiguously aggregated in the uplink (intra-
band), the spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~)
starting from the ± edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth.
For CA Bandwidth Class A, the power of any UE emission shall not exceed the
levels specified in Table 6.6.2.1.1-1 of TS36.101 with the aggregated channel
bandwidth replacing the channel bandwidth.
For CA Bandwidth Class C, the power of any UE emission shall not exceed the
levels specified in Table 5.3.1-1 for the specified channel bandwidth.
Table 5.3.1-1: General E-UTRA CA spectrum emission mask for Bandwidth Class C

The SEM for all combinations other than 20+15MHz is inherited from TS36.101,
Release 10. For the case of 20+15MHz it is derived using the following
approach:
● The first step is to calculate the aggregated bandwidth. According to
TR36.807 and using the formula in Section 5.7.1A of TS36.101, the nominal
channel spacing for the case of 20+15MHz is 17.1MHz. Using the formulae in
Section 5.6A of TS36.101 yields BW~GB~ of 1MHz and hence F~offset,low~ of
10MHz and F~offset,high~ of 7.75MHz, assuming the low CC is 20MHz and the high
CC is 15MHz. As a result the aggregated channel bandwidth is 17.1+10+7.75 =
34.85MHz. The requirement of -13dBm/MHz therefore applies in the interval
±5-34.85MHz and -25dBm/MHz in the interval ±34.85-39.85MHz.
● The second step is to determine the value for the ± 0-1MHz interval.
Referring to Table 6.6.2.1A-1 in TS36.101, the value is scaled with the
aggregated channel bandwidth, hence it is proposed to use the rounded to the
nearest 0.5dB value of -23.5dBm/30kHz for the ± 0-1MHz interval.
### 5.3.2 Additional spectrum emission mask
When the additional spectrum emissions mask is required by the network, then
for CA Bandwidth Class A, the power of any UE emission shall not exceed the
levels specified in Table 6.6.2.2.2 of TS36.101 with the aggregated channel
bandwidth replacing the channel bandwidth. For CA Bandwidth Class C, the power
of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 5.3.2-1.
Table 5.3.2-1: Additional requirements

Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network for a
B41_C UE by using NS_1X, with the exact NS value being defined when the CRs
are written for this CA band, during CA specific configuration of PCell and
SCell to indicate that the UE shall meet the additional SEM defined in this
section. Note that the NS configuration of both PCell and SCell shall be
common.
For the B41_A UE, the requirement to meet the additional SEM is indicated by
NS_04 in the Release 8 elements of the SIB Type 2 message.
### 5.3.3 MPR for new 75 RB + 100 RB CC combination
This section defines the MPR for the new CC combination of 75 RB + 100 RB. For
all other combinations supported by Band 41, the MPR already defined in
TS36.101 will be used.
#### 5.3.3.1 Contiguous RB transmission
The need for MPR with contiguous allocations was studied against the
requirements in Table 5.3.1-1 for 75 RB + 100 RB CC combination with:
\- UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33dB
\- UTRA~ACLR2~ = 36dB
\- CA E-UTRA~ACRL~ = 30dB
\- Spurious emissions limit was -30dBm with 1MHz measurement bandwidth
Simulation assumptions were as follows:
● PA operating point: UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc with Pout = 22 dBm
● Modulator IQ -- image = 25 dB
● Modulator carrier leakage = 25 dBc
● Modulator C_IM3 = 60 dBc
The PA operating point was set for each bandwidth so that with fully allocated
carrier the reported UTRA ACLR1 level was 33 dB when 1 dB of MPR was applied.
Results are presented in Figures 5.3.3.1-1 and 5.3.3.1-2 where the number of
allocated RBs is shown on the x-axis and required MPR is on the y-axis.

Figure 5.3.3.1-2. MPR for 100 + 100 RB CA Configuration
It can be observed that UE is able to meet the all the required requirements
if the MPR definition follows same approach as that used for existing CC
combinations of 50 + 100 RB, 75 + 75 RB and 100 RB + 100 RB.
Therefore, the allowed MPR for the maximum output power in Table 6.2.2A-1 of
TS 36.101 due to higher order modulation and contiguously aggregated transmit
bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table 5.3.3.1-1. In
case the modulation format is different on different component carriers then
the MPR is determined by the rules applied to higher order of those
modulations.

16 QAM > 75 ≤ 3
* * *
#### 5.3.3.2 Multi-cluster RB transmission
The need for MPR with multi-cluster allocations was studied against the
requirements in Table 5.3.1-1 for 75 RB + 100 RB CC combination with:
\- UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33dB
\- UTRA~ACLR2~ = 36dB
\- CA E-UTRA~ACRL~ = 30dB
\- Spurious emissions limit was -30dBm with 1MHz measurement bandwidth
During the simulation campaign a large set of randomly created allocation
scenarios were simulated and appropriate back off value was searched. These
simulation scenarios were used with both 16-QAM and QPSK modulations and
included two to four clusters.
Simulation assumptions were as follows:
● PA operating point: UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc with Pout = 22 dBm
● Modulator IQ -- image = 25 dB
● Modulator carrier leakage = 25 dBc
● Modulator C_IM3 = 60 dBc
The PA operating point was set so that with fully allocated carrier REL-8
20MHz carrier the reported UTRA ACLR1 level was 33 dB when 1 dB of MPR was
applied.
Figure 5.3.3.2-1 shows all the back-off required for all the simulated
allocations against allocation ratio and general E-UTRA CA mask MPR
requirement.

Figure 5.3.3.2-1: 75RB + 100RB CA configuration against general E-UTRA SEM
It can be seen that all simulated allocations are compatible with the general
E-UTRA spectrum emission mask; hence the MPR requirement in TS 36.101 can be
used for 75 RB + 100 RBs.
### 5.3.4 A-MPR
This section defines the A-MPR for the all CC combination considering the
additional spectrum emission requirement defined in Section 5.3.2.
In the case of CA, A-MPR is not used in addition to MPR; either MPR is allowed
to meet the mask defined in Section 5.3.1 or A-MPR is allowed to meet the mask
defined in Section 5.3.2.
#### 5.3.4.1 Contiguous RB transmission
The need for A-MPR with contiguous allocations was studied against following
requirements in Table 5.3.2-1 for all allowed CC combinations, with:
\- UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33dB
\- UTRA~ACLR2~ = 36dB
\- CA E-UTRA~ACRL~ = 30dB
\- Spurious emissions limit was -30dBm with 1MHz measurement bandwidth
Simulation assumptions were as follows:
● PA operating point: UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc with Pout = 22 dBm
● Modulator IQ -- image = 25 dB
● Modulator carrier leakage = 25 dBc
● Modulator C_IM3 = 60 dBc
PA operating point was set so that with fully allocated carrier REL-8 20MHz
carrier the reported UTRA ACLR1 level was 33 dB when 1 dB of MPR was applied.
Results from these simulations are shown in the figures below.

Note that it is assumed that in order to maintain PUCCH link budget that over
provisioning of PUCCH resources will be applied to enable the PUCCH
allocations to fall into RBs where no A-MPR will be applied. The over
provisioned PUCCH resources can be reused for PUSCH allocation to UEs where
the application of an A-MPR is acceptable.
For carrier aggregation the MPR and A-MPR are not additive, if UE is allowed
to have A-MPR in CA mode the allowed maximum output power reduction defined
solely in by A-MPR mask and will surpass MPR mask.
#### 5.3.4.2 Multi-cluster RB transmission
The need for A-MPR with multi-cluster allocations was studied against
following requirements in Table 5.3.2-1 for all allowed CC combinations, with:
\- UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33dB
\- UTRA~ACLR2~ = 36dB
\- CA E-UTRA~ACRL~ = 30dB
\- Spurious emissions limit was -30dBm with 1MHz measurement bandwidth
During the simulation campaign a large set of randomly created allocation
scenarios were simulated and appropriate back off value was searched. These
simulation scenarios were used with both 16-QAM and QPSK modulations and
included two to four clusters.
Simulation assumptions were as follows:
● PA operating point: UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc with Pout = 22 dBm
● Modulator IQ -- image = 25 dB
● Modulator carrier leakage = 25 dBc
● Modulator C_IM3 = 60 dBc
PA operating point was set so that with fully allocated carrier REL-8 20MHz
carrier the reported UTRA ACLR1 level was 33 dB when 1 dB of MPR was applied.
Results from these simulations with proposed A-MPR mask are shown in the
figures below

The results between different bandwidths are very similar. Therefore we
propose a single A-MPR mask for all the bandwidth combinations in band CA_41C.
All simulated allocations with the proposed mask are gathered together in
Figure 5.3.4.2-5.

The mask shown in Figure 5.3.4.2-5 can be formally defined as follows
A-MPR = CEIL {M~A,~ 0.5}
Where M~A~ is defined as follows
> M~A~ = 10.5; 0 ≤ A \
> -50.0A + 13.00; 0.05 ≤ A \
> -4.0A + 6.10; 0.05 ≤ A \
> -0.83A + 4.83; 0.40 ≤ A ≤ 1
Where A = N~RB_alloc~ / N~RB_agg.~
For carrier aggregation the MPR and A-MPR are not additive, if UE is allowed
to have A-MPR in CA mode the allowed maximum output power reduction defined
solely in by A-MPR mask and will surpass MPR mask.

### 5.3.5 Reference sensitivity power level
Section 7.3.1A in TS 36.101 deals with the reference sensitivity requirements
for CA. In general TDD intra-band CA does not change the UE reference
sensitivity requirement for CA, and as Band 41 does not introduce any new
requirements that impact CA aspects of reference sensitivity, no changes need
to be made to the existing CA requirements.
However the following changes are required in the definition of the uplink
configuration to support reference sensitivity testing:
\- Add a row in Table 7.3.1A-1 for B41_C to describe the UL allocation that
shall be used for the case of a UE that supports Bandwidth Class C UL
\- Add support for 100RB+75RB into Table 7.3.1A-1 for CA_41C only (other bands
will be marked as n/a)
These changes are shown in the following table.
Table 5.3.5-1: Intra-band CA uplink configuration for reference sensitivity
CA Band / Aggregated channel bandwidth / NRB / Duplex mode |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
CA Band | 100RB+50RB | 75RB+75RB | 100RB+75RB | 100RB+100RB | Duplex Mode |  |  |  |   
CA_41C | PCC | SCC | PCC | SCC | PCC | SCC | PCC | SCC | TDD  
| 100 | 50 | 75 | 75 | 100 | 75 | 100 | 100 |   
NOTE 1. The carrier centre frequency of SCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL operating band. NOTE 2. The transmitted power over both PCC and SCC shall be set to PUMAX as defined in clause 6.2.5. NOTE 3. The UL resource blocks in both PCC and SCC shall be confined within the transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.6-1). |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
While asymmetrical CC BW combinations are allowed in TS 36.101, it is noted
that due to the location of the LO, this could cause some impact to RBs in the
LO region. It is proposed that this impact should be studied further as part
of LTE core specification, and if it is found that the current requirement in
TS 36.101, Section 7.3.1A cannot be met, then a general exception should be
provided for the case of asymmetrical CC BW combinations. This is not
considered further as this is a generic core specification issue, rather than
a Band 41 specific issue.
### 5.3.6 In-band blocking
Section 7.6.1.1A in TS 36.101 deals with the in-band blocking requirements for
CA. There are no special blocking requirements for Band 41 relative to the
other bands apart from the introduction of 100RB + 75RB CC combination which,
based on the study presented in subclause 5.3.8, was found to be supported by
current requirements. Therefore no changes need to be made to the existing
requirements for CA.
All that is required is to modify Table 7.6.1.1A-2 to indicate that the same
requirement that is applied to Band 1 and Band 40 CA also applies to Band 41
CA, as shown below.
Table 5.3.6-1: In-band blocking

### 5.3.7 Out-of-band blocking
Section 7.6.2.1A in TS 36.101 deals with the out-of-band blocking requirements
for CA. There are no special blocking requirements for Band 41 relative to the
other bands apart from the introduction of 100RB + 75RB CC combination which,
based on the study presented in subclause 5.3.8, was found to be supported by
current requirements. Therefore no changes need to be made to the existing
requirements for CA.
All that is required is to modify Table 7.6.2.1A-2 to indicate that the same
requirement that is applied to Band 1 and Band 40 CA also applies to Band 41
CA, as shown below.

### 5.3.8 UE receiver requirements for new 75 RB + 100 RB CC combination
A simulation campaign was conducted to repeat the receiver requirement
simulations for the new CC combination for Band 41 CA. This section presents
the simulation setup and assumptions, results and conclusion that the
requirements in TS 36.101 for the existing CC combinations can also be applied
to the new CC combination of 75 RB + 100 RB.
#### 5.3.8.1 Simulation set-up and assumptions
Simulation set-up is illustrated in the Figure 5.3.8.1-1 and the used receiver
chain parameters are listed below.
{width="6.6875in" height="3.8020833333333335in"}
Figure 5.3.8.1-1 Simulation set-up
UE receiver chain parameters:
\- Duplexer receive insertion loss = 4dB
\- LNA gain = 4dB
\- LNA noise figure = 5dB
\- LNA IIP3 = -10 ... +10 dBm
\- LNA 1dB compression point = 10dB below IIP3
\- LNA IIP2 = 56dBm
\- Image artefact not modelled.
\- ADC sample rate = 92.16MHz
\- ADC bits = 8
\- ADC fading margin (above peak power) = 0 ... 12dB
When simulations were done against ADC fading margin, LNA IIP3 was kept
constant at -5 dBm. Correspondingly when simulations were done against LNA
IIP3, then ADC fading margin was constant 5 dB.
Simulations were performed with both FDD and TDD duplexing modes. Metrics used
for measuring results were error vector magnitude (EVM) and signal to noise +
interference ratio (SNIR).
**ACS**
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to
receive an E-UTRA signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre
frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter
attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter
attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
Test parameters for ACS are specified in Section 7.5 of TS 36.101.
**In-band blocking**
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into
the UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive
band at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirement for the specified measurement channels.
Test parameters for in-band blocking are specified in Section 7.6.1 of TS
36.101.
**Narrowband blocking**
This requirement is measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive an E-UTRA
signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an unwanted narrow
band CW interferer at a frequency, which is less than the nominal channel
spacing.
Test parameters for Narrowband blocking are specified in Section 7.6.3 of TS
36.101.
**Intermodulation characteristics**
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receiver a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific frequency
relationship to the wanted signal.
Test parameters for intermodulation characteristics are specified in Section
7.8.1 of TS 36.101.

#### 5.3.8.3 Summary
Results for new CC combination 75+100RB are in line with results obtained in
REL-10 CA WI for other CC combinations. Hence the existing contiguous intra-
band CA Rx requirements can be extended to cover the new CC combinations.
## 5.4 Specific BS RF requirements
A study of the existing technical specifications, including MSR, was
conducted. The study concluded that no impact to BS RF specifications is
required. Support for Band 41 CA in the BS specifications can be accommodated
solely by a new entry for CA_41 in Table 5.5-2 in TS 36.104 and a new entry
for CA_41 in Table 5.5-2 in TS 36.141. These changes are identified in Section
6.2 and 6.4.
## 5.5 Specific UE RRM requirements
A study of the existing technical specifications was conducted. The study
concluded that no impact to UE RRM specifications is required.
