# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for Inter-band Carrier Aggregation
under Rel-11 time frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant background
information and studies in order to address Inter-band Carrier Aggregation
requirements.
This TR covers relevant background information and studies in order to address
Inter-band Carrier Aggregation requirements for the Rel-11 band combinations
in table 1-1.
