# 4 Interfaces to the physical layer
## 4.1 Interface to MAC
## 4.2 Interface to RRC
# 5 Services and functions of the physical layer
## 5.1 General
The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers.
The access to these services is through the use of transport channels via the
MAC sub-layer.
A transport block is defined as the data delivered by MAC layer to the
physical layer and vice versa. Transport blocks are delivered once every TTI.
## 5.2 Overview of L1 functions
The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers. The access
to these services is through the use of a transport channel via the MAC sub-
layer. The physical layer is expected to perform the following functions in
order to provide the data transport service:
> \- Error detection on the transport channel and indication to higher layers
>
> \- FEC encoding/decoding of the transport channel
>
> \- Hybrid ARQ soft-combining
>
> \- Rate matching of the coded transport channel to physical channels
\- Mapping of the coded transport channel onto physical channels
\- Power weighting of physical channels
\- Modulation and demodulation of physical channels
\- Frequency and time synchronisation
\- Radio characteristics measurements and indication to higher layers
\- Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna processing
\- Transmit Diversity (TX diversity)
\- Beamforming
\- RF processing. (Note: RF processing aspects are specified in the TS 36.100)
L1 functions are modelled for each transport channel in subclauses 6.1 and
6.2.
## 5.3 L1 interactions with MAC retransmission functionality
# 6 Model of physical layer of the UE
The E-UTRA physical-layer model captures those characteristics of the E-UTRA
physical-layer that are relevant from the point-of-view of higher layers. More
specifically, the physical-layer model captures:
\- The structure of higher-layer data being passed down to or up from the
physical layer;
\- The means by which higher layers can configure the physical layer;
\- The different indications (error indications, channel-quality indications,
etc.) that are provided by the physical layer to higher layers;
\- Other (non-transport-channel-based) higher-layer peer-to-peer signalling
supported by the physical layer.
## 6.1 Uplink model
### 6.1.1 Uplink Shared Channel
The physical-layer model for Uplink Shared Channel transmission is described
based on the corresponding physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure
6.1.1-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g.
in the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in
blue. It should be noted that, in case PUSCH, the scheduling decision is fully
done at the network side. The uplink transmission control in the UE then
configures the uplink physical-layer processing, based on uplink transport-
format and resource-assignment information received on the downlink.
**\- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- One transport block of dynamic size delivered to the physical layer once
every TTI.
**\- CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
**\- FEC and rate _matching_**
\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of transport
block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;
\- Physical layer model support of HARQ: in case of Incremental Redundancy,
the corresponding Layer 2 Hybrid-ARQ process controls what redundancy version
is to be used for the physical layer transmission for each TTI.
**\- Interleaving**
\- No control of interleaving by higher layers.
**\- Data modulation**
\- Modulation scheme is decided by MAC Scheduler (QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM).
**\- Mapping to physical resource**
\- L2-controlled resource assignment.
**\- Multi-antenna processing**
\- MAC Scheduler partly configures mapping from assigned resource blocks to
the available number of antenna ports.
**\- Support of L1 control signalling**
\- Transmission of ACK/NAK and CSI feedback related to DL data transmission
The model of Figure 6.1.1-1 also captures
\- Transport via physical layer of Hybrid-ARQ related information associated
with the PUSCH, to the peer HARQ process at the transmitter side;
\- Transport via physical layer of corresponding HARQ acknowledgements to
PUSCH transmitter side.
If a UE is configured with one or more SCells, the physical-layer-processing
chain in Figure 6.1.1-1 is repeated for every UL Serving Cell.
Figure 6.1.1-1: Physical-layer model for UL-SCH transmission
### 6.1.2 Random-access Channel
## 6.2 Downlink model
### 6.2.1 Downlink-Shared Channel
The physical-layer model for Downlink Shared Channel transmission model is
described based on the corresponding PDSCH physical-layer-processing chain,
see Figure 6.2.1-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer
model, e.g. in the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are
highlighted in blue on the figure.
**\- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- N (up to two) transport blocks of dynamic size delivered to the physical
layer once every TTI.
**\- CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
**\- FEC and rate _matching_**
\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of transport
block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;
\- Physical layer model support of HARQ: in case of Incremental Redundancy,
the corresponding Layer 2 Hybrid-ARQ process controls what redundancy version
is to be used for the physical layer transmission for each TTI.
**\- Data modulation**
\- Modulation scheme is decided by MAC Scheduler (QPSK, 16QAM and 64 QAM).
**Multi-antenna processing**
\- MAC Scheduler partly configures mapping from modulated code words (for each
stream) to the available number of antenna ports.
**\- Mapping to physical resource**
\- L2-controlled resource assignment.
**\- Support of L1 control signalling**
\- Transmission of scheduler related control signals.
**\- Support for Hybrid-ARQ-related signalling**
The model of Figure 6.2.1-1 also captures:
\- Transport via physical layer of Hybrid-ARQ related information associated
with the PDSCH, to the peer HARQ process at the receiver side;
\- Transport via physical layer of corresponding HARQ acknowledgements to
PDSCH transmitter side.
If a UE is configured with one or more SCells, the physical-layer-processing
chain in Figure 6.2.1-1 is repeated for every DL Serving Cell.
NOTE: The signalling of transport-format and resource-allocation is not
captured in the physical-layer model. At the transmitter side, this
information can be directly derived from the configuration of the physical
layer. The physical layer then transports this information over the radio
interface to its peer physical layer, presumably multiplexed in one way or
another with the HARQ-related information. On the receiver side, this
information is, in contrast to the HARQ-related information, used directly
within the physical layer for PDSCH demodulation, decoding etc., without
passing through higher layers.
Figure 6.2.1-1: Physical-layer model for DL-SCH transmission
### 6.2.2 Broadcast Channel
The physical-layer model for BCH transmission is characterized by a fixed pre-
defined transport format. The TTI (repetition rate) of the BCH is 40 ms. The
BCH physical-layer model is described based on the corresponding BCH physical-
layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.2.2-1:
\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- A single (fixed-size) transport block per TTI.
\- **CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
\- **FEC and rate _matching_**
\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of transport
block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;
\- No BCH Hybrid ARQ, i.e. no higher-layer control of redundancy version.
\- **Data modulation**
\- Fixed modulation scheme (QPSK), i.e. no higher-layer control.
\- **Mapping to physical resource**
\- Fixed pre-determined transport format and resource allocation, i.e. no
higher-layer control.
**\- Multi-antenna processing**
  * Fixed pre-determined processing, i.e. no higher-layer control.
\- **Support for Hybrid-ARQ-related signalling**
\- No Hybrid ARQ.

### 6.2.3 Paging Channel
The physical-layer model for PCH transmission is described based on the
corresponding PCH physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.2.3-1.
Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g. in the
sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in blue on
the figure.
\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- A single transport block per TTI.
\- **CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
\- **FEC and rate _matching_**

\- **Data modulation**
\- Modulation scheme is decided by MAC Scheduler.
\- **Mapping to physical resource**
\- L2 controlled resource assignment;
\- Possible support of dynamic transport format and resource allocation.
**\- Multi-antenna processing**
\- MAC Scheduler partly configures mapping from assigned resource blocks to
the available number of antenna ports.
\- **Support for Hybrid-ARQ-related signalling**
No Hybrid ARQ.
Figure 6.2.3-1: Physical-layer model for PCH transmission
### 6.2.4 Multicast Channel
The physical-layer model for MCH transmission is characterized by the support
for multi-cell reception at the UE (a.k.a. \"MBSFN\" transmission). This
implies that only semi-static configuration of the MCH transport format and
resource assignment is possible. The MCH physical-layer model is described
based on the corresponding MCH physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure
6.2.4-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g.
in the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in
blue.
\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- One transport block delivered to physical layer once every TTI.
\- **CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
\- **FEC and rate _matching_**

\- **Data modulation**
\- Modulation scheme is configured by RRC layer.
\- **Mapping to physical resource**
\- L2 controlled semi--static resource assignment.
\- **Multi-antenna processing**

# 9 Measurements provided by the physical layer
## 9.1 Model of physical layer measurements
## 9.2 UE Measurements
UE measurement: **Reference signal received power (RSRP)** : Reference signal
received power (RSRP) is determined for a considered cell as the linear
average over the power contributions (in [W]) of the resource elements that
carry cell-specific reference signals within the considered measurement
frequency bandwidth. For RSRP determination the cell-specific reference
signals R~0~ and if available R~1~ according to [8] can be used.
If receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the reported value shall be in
accordance with [11].
UE measurement: **Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ)** : Reference
Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) is defined as the ratio _N_ Ã—RSRP / (E-UTRA
carrier RSSI), where _N_ is the number of RB's of the E-UTRA carrier RSSI
measurement bandwidth. The measurements in the numerator and denominator shall
be made over the same set of resource blocks.
E-UTRA Carrier Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), comprises the linear
average of the total received power (in [W]) observed only in OFDM symbols
containing reference symbols for antenna port 0, in the measurement bandwidth,
over _N_ number of resource blocks by the UE from all sources, including co-
channel serving and non-serving cells, adjacent channel interference, thermal
noise etc.
If receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the reported value shall be in
accordance with [11].
UE measurement: **UTRA CPICH RSCP** : Received Signal Code Power, the received
power on one code measured on the Primary CPICH.
UE measurement: **UTRA FDD carrier RSSI** : _received wide band power,
including thermal noise and noise generated in the receiver, within the
bandwidth defined by the receiver pulse shaping filter._
UE measurement: **UTRA FDD CPICH Ec/No** : received energy per chip divided by
the power density in the band. _The CPICH Ec/No is identical to CPICH
RSCP/UTRA Carrier RSSI_. Measurement is performed on the Primary CPICH.
UE measurement: **GSM carrier RSSI** : Received Signal Strength Indicator, the
wide-band received power within the relevant channel bandwidth. Measurement is
performed on a GSM BCCH carrier.
UE measurement: **UTRA TDD carrier RSSI** : The received wide band power,
including thermal noise and noise generated in the receiver, within the
bandwidth defined by the receiver pulse shaping filter, for TDD within a
specified timeslot.
UE measurement: **UTRA TDD P-CCPCH RSCP** : Received Signal Code Power, the
received power on P-CCPCH of a neighbour UTRA TDD cell.
## 9.3 E-UTRAN Measurements
The detailed E-UTRAN measurements definition is provided in [9]:
eNode B measurement: **DL RS TX power** : Downlink reference signal transmit
power is determined for a considered cell as the linear average over the power
contributions (in [W]) of the resource elements that carry cell-specific
reference signals which are transmitted by the eNode B within its operating
system bandwidth.
For DL RS TX power determination the cell-specific reference signals R~0~ and
if available R~1~ according to [8] can be used.
The reference point for the DL RS TX power measurement shall be the TX antenna
connector.
