# 1 Scope
The present document is the technical report on the \"Relays for LTE" work
item [2]. The overall objective of the WI is to specify Relays for LTE in
Rel-10 timeframe.
This document is intended to gather the relevant background information in
order to address Relay Node (RN) requirements as well as propose suitable
updates to the specifications under the responsibility of RAN4. RAN4 have
agreed to focus on fixed RN.

# 4 General assumptions
## 4.1 Relay classification
The Relay classes are defined based on the RF scenarios expected for the Relay
access deployment, defined in terms of the Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) between
Relay and UE. The following definitions are used:
\- High-CL Relay are characterised by requirements derived from outdoor Relay
scenarios with a Relay to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 59 dB.
\- Low-CL Relay are characterised by requirements derived from indoor Relay
scenarios with a Relay to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 45 dB.
## 4.2 Power classes
Two power classes are defined as the maximum output power for relay access
link as in Table 4.2-1.
Table 4.2-1 Relay access link power class
* * *
Power class Pmax [dBm] Power class 1 24 Power class 2 30
* * *
Single power class is defined for the maximum output power for relay backhaul
link as in Table 4.2-2
Table 4.2-2 Relay backhaul link power class
* * *
Power class Pmax [dBm] Power class 1 24
* * *
It should be noted that the specified power class is the maximum output power
and does not specify the power that a relay must transmit at.
## 4.3 Operating Bands
For in-band Relay backhaul and access link shouldoperate in the same operating
band.
## 4.4 Channel bandwidth
Requirements in present document are specified for the channel bandwidths
listed in Table 4.4-1.
Table 4.4-1 Transmission bandwidth configuration NRB in E-UTRA channel
bandwidths
* * *
Channel bandwidth BW~Channel~ [MHz] 1.4 3 5 10 15 20 Transmission bandwidth
configuration N~RB~ 6 15 25 50 75 100
* * *
For access link, relay should declare the supported bandwidth(s) as a BS does,
and for backhaul link, relay should support all the bandwidths listed in TS
36.101 Table 5.6.1-1. Note that NOTE 1 in TS 36.101 Table 5.6.1-1 does not
apply for relay.
# 5 Methodology
\
# 6 System scenarios
The main use scenario for relays studied in this TR is illustrated in Figure
6-1. The network consists of both eNodeBs and relay nodes (RN). The network is
deployed in a urban environment and the main purposes for the relays are to
provide
a) coverage extension
b) indoor coverage and increased data rates in areas with poor performance.

Figure 6-1 Example of a relay deployment scenario: a) outdoor relay; b) indoor
relay c) truwall relay
The Macro network is a typical network using three-sector site planning over a
single carrier. Support for carrier aggregation with relay nodes is FFS.
The relay nodes are owned and operated by an operator. The relays are located
either indoors or outdoors and there are a few relays per eNodeB. The
deployment of the relays is planned to provide coverage and/or enhance
throughput in specific areas.. MIMO can be used both in the access and the
backhaul link.
As the primary function of relay node is for the coverage-improvement, both
outdoor and indoor scenarios should be considered. The outdoor relay could be
used for cell-edge coverage through throughput enhancement for cell edge users
and/or coverage extension, and the indoor relay is used for solving indoor
dead spot and hot spot scenarios. The probability that a UE is located indoors
is 80%. In each Macro cell there are several relay nodes controlled by the
same operator Table 6.1 summarize some basic characteristics for further
study.

## 6.1 Coexistence simulation cases
In this subclause the simulation cases for coexistence studies are outlined.
Systems using relays is different from previously performed coexistence
studies in the sense that there are different kinds of nodes that cause
interference and that are impacted. In Table 6.1-1 the aggressor links and
victim links are listed.
Both the aggressor and the victim networks contain eNB, RN and UE nodes.

## 6.2 System layout
This section describes the deployment used for eNodeB and RN. In all
deployments there will be a fixed number [1, 4] of relay nodes per cell.
Table 6.2-1 Possible Parameter Definitions for Macro Network
* * *
Parameter Macro Network
Environment Macro cell, Urban (Case1)\ Rural area (Case3)
Macro Cellular layout Hexagonal grid, 19 cell sites, 57 sectors with BTS in
the corner of the cell
Macro Cell ISD a) Case 1 with an ISD of 500 meters\ b) Case 3 with and ISD of
1.732 km
* * *
### 6.2.1 Uncoordinated macro cellular deployment, RN at cell edge
#### 6.2.1.1 Network layout
Simulations are performed in the \"Uncoordinated macro cellular deployment\"
described in section 4.4.2.1 of [5].
The RNs are located at [0.5, 1, 1.5] R (cell radius) from the eNodeB. The RN
are evenly spread over a total angle of +/- 30 degrees.
The exact distance to use is FFS and needs to be agreed in further meetings.
Initially a number of parameters are used.
{width="5.586111111111111in" height="5.29375in"}
Figure 6.2.1.1-1 Example of RN deployment. 5 RN per eNB. NOTE: Victim eNB not
shown currently
#### 6.2.1.2 UE location
UEs are located uniformly over the service area with [30] UEs per BS sector,
i.e. per unit area of ISD\^2 * sqrt(3)/6 .
On average 30 UE are placed inside each macro cell.
UEs are located indoors with a probability of 80%.
Uniform UE distribution shall be the baseline.
Other UE distribution methods may also be used in order to accelerate the
simulation, such as the method in TR 36.814 Table A.2.1.1.2-5.
### 6.2.2 Uncoordinated macro cellular deployment, RN at regular grid
This deployment scenario uses the same assumptions as the deployment scenario
in 6.2.1 with the exception that the RN are placed on a regular square grid. 4
relay nodes are assumed to be symmetrically placed about the cell center with
an inter-relay node distance of 0.9 times the cell radius. An illustration of
the regular grid is shown in figure 6.2.2-1.
{width="5.716666666666667in" height="4.2875in"}
Figure 6.2.2-1 Example of regular RN grid deployment. 4 RN per eNB. NOTE:
Victim eNB not shown currently
### 6.2.3 Manhattan grid deployment
Use of Manhattan grid is FFS.
### 6.2.4 Thruwall scenario
#### 6.2.4.1 Network layout
Figure 6.2.4.1-1 shows the thruwall relay scenario. Assume there are 5 in-
building coverage areas randomly located within the donor cell.
In-building coverage areas will be modelled as a 50 meter by 50 meter square
area
In-building coverage areas will be served by one dedic ated relay node that
can be modelled as a thruwall relay positioned on the wall closest to the eNB
along the boresite between the eNB and the center of the coverage area.The
antennas are located on this position on either side of the wall. . No
penetration loss is assumed for the Un backhaul link
The building wall closest to the eNB is perpendicular to a line between the BS
and the center of the building. The building cannot be located on the border
of the cell, i.e. the entire building has to be inside one cell.
Modelling of floor loss if FFS.
Indoor propagation will be modelled using a 5x5 grid of 10 m by 10 m
apartments in a 50 m by 50 m cluster, and employing the pathloss models of
Table A.2.1.1.2-3 in [3].
{width="6.374305555555556in" height="3.5659722222222223in"}
Figure 6.2.4.1-1 Illustration of indoor cluster modeling for relay co-
existence studies
#### 6.2.4.2 UE Locations
Each in-building coverage area will have a cluster of 4 indoor UEs randomly
dropped within the in-building coverage area.
The building coverage consists of a 5x5 cluster of apartments, each of size
10mx10m. Only one UE can be located in each apartment. Figure 6.2.4.2-1
illustrates the 5x5 Grid model:
{width="6.69375in" height="3.39375in"}
Figure 6.2.4.2-1: 5x5 Indoor Grid Model
In addition 10 outdoor UEs will be randomly dropped in the donor cell and will
be served by either the eNB or one of the truwall relays.
### 6.2.5 Thruwall scenario with regular building layout
For the thru-wall scenario with regular building layout the following
assumptions apply:
Buildings with a size of 50x50 m are located on a regular grid. The regular
grid is the same as in subclause 6.2.2. Building orientation and antenna
locations is the same as in subclause 6.2.4.
UE locations inside the building is the same as described in subclause
6.2.4.2.In addition 10 outdoor UEs will be randomly dropped in the donor cell.
## 6.3 Cell selection
UEs are connected to the BS if: RSRP~BS~ > RSRP~RN~ + Δ~RSPR~ and to the RN
otherwise.
Δ~RSPR~ is a tuning parameter to balance the load between RN and BS by
ensuring that UL and DL links are approximately equal. Δ~RSPR~ is set to [5]
dB.

Study area: How would the case with omnidirectional backhaul work. Do we need
a separate ACLR/ACS spec/class?
### 6.4.1 UE antenna
The UE antenna is modelled as an omnidirectional antenna with 0 dBi gain.
Antenna height is [1.5] m.
### 6.4.2 eNB antenna
The model for the eNB antenna is the same used in [5]. The eNB antenna has the
following horizontal pattern:
$\theta_{3\text{dB}}$ is the 3dB beam width which corresponds to 65 degrees,
and $A_{m} = \text{20}\text{dB}$ is the maximum attenuation.
The antenna height is 30 m and the gain is 15dBi including feeder losses
corresponding to the urban scenario for 2GHz in [5].
### 6.4.3 RN antennas
The RN antenna parameters are given in table 6.4-1.
The gain in table 6.4-1 for an omnidirectional antenna includes feeder losses.
For a directional antenna the beamwidth and gain is stated in table 6.4-1. The
antenna pattern is given by:
$\theta_{3\text{dB}}$ is the 3dB beam width and and $A_{m} =
\text{20}\text{dB}$ is the maximum attenuation.

frequency, and R is in km.
### 6.5.1 Case 1: ISD of 500 meters
This subsection lists the propagation models and MCL values to be used for the
links in a system with a Case 1 ISD of 500 meters
#### 6.5.1.1 Macro-UE link

With site planning
As the RNs are controlled by the operators, they can do site planning such
that the LOS probability between donor- eNB and RNs are maximized in order to
increase the throughput/coverage for the backhaul link. Even if the link
between the donor-eNB and RN is NLOS, the operators can still do site planning
in order to improve the shadowing of the propagation channel. Below are the
adjustments on LOS probability and lognormal shadowing when site planning is
conducted by the operators [3]:
For LOS: PL~LOS~ (R)
For NLOS: PL~NLOS~ (R)-B, where B=5dB, for donor macro (from each of its
sectors) to relay, otherwise, for non-donor cell and non optimized deployment

LOS Probability function: Prob(R)=0.5-min(0.5,5exp(-0.156/R))+min(0.5,
5exp(-R/0.03))
MCL is: (64 -- G~AC~) dB for outdoor deployments of the access antenna [4] ,

In case of an outdoor Relay and an indoor UE, an additional wall penetration
loss of [18] dB has to be considered.

Relay to UEs in different clusters: L= 128.1+37.6log10(R)
Note that the number of floors in the path is assumed to be 0.
MCL is: (50 -- G~AC~) dB for indoor deployments of the access antenna [4],
where G~AC~ is the relay access antenna gain.

UE, and 8dB for other links
The penetration loss of the wall separating apartments is 5dB.6.5.1.5
Correlation for shadowing
For the same type of link (i.e. Macro-Relay link, Relay-UE link, and Macro-UE
link respectively), a shadowing correlation factor of 0.5 for the shadowing
between sites (regardless aggressing or victim system) and of 1 between
sectors of the same site shall be used. Furthermore, no correlation is assumed
for shadowing between different types of link (i.e. Macro-Relay and Relay-UE,
Macro-Relay and Macro-UE, Relay-UE and Macro-UE).

### 6.5.2 Case 3: ISD of 1.732 km
This subsection lists the propagation models and MCL values to be used for the
links in a system with a Case 3 ISD of 1.732 km
#### 6.5.2.1 Macro-UE link
LOS scenario: PL~LOS~ (R)= 103.4+24.2log10(R)
NLOS scenario: PL~NLOS~ (R)= 131.1+42.8log10(R)
LOS Probability function: Prob(R)=exp(-(R-0.01)/1.0)

study only.

In case of an outdoor Relay and an indoor UE, an additional wall penetration
loss of [18] dB has to be considered.
In case of both indoor Relay and UE in NLOS, an additional wall penetration
loss of [7] dB has to be considered.

The same propagation model as in subclause 6.5.1.4 applies.
#### 6.5.2.5 Correlation for shadowing
For the same type of link (i.e. Macro-Relay link, Relay-UE link, and Macro-UE
link respectively), a shadowing correlation factor of 0.5 for the shadowing
between sites (regardless aggressing or victim system) and of 1 between
sectors of the same site shall be used. Furthermore, no correlation is assumed
for shadowing between different types of link (i.e. Macro-Relay and Relay-UE,
Macro-Relay and Macro-UE, Relay-UE and Macro-UE).
## 6.6 Power control
The Rel 8 power control algorithm is employed for the backhaul uplink from the
RN to the eNB as well as for the access uplink from the UE to the RN. As
defined in TS36.942, section 5.1.1.6 [5], the following power control equation
should be used for the initial uplink co-existence simulations with RNs:
where Pmax is the maximum transmit power, Rmin is the minimum power reduction
ratio to prevent UEs or RNs with good channels to transmit at very low power
level, PL is the path loss for the UE or RN and PLx-ile is the x-percentile
path loss (plus shadowing) value. With this power control equation, the x
percent of UEs or RNs that have the highest pathloss will transmit at Pmax.
Finally, 0\eNB link

## 6.7 Interference
The amount of interference caused by a system in the adjacent channel is
defined by the Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) of the aggressor
system and the Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) of the victim system.
Together with ACS, the ACLR defines the Adjacent Channel Interference Ratio
(ACIR) as
{width="1.5965277777777778in" height="0.6527777777777778in"}
This relation and its application rely on identical assumed reference
bandwidths in the ACLR and ACS definitions. If aggressor and victim have
different reference bandwidths, both ACLR and ACS definitions have to account
for exactly those bandwidths. This becomes more complex when there are
different systems involved or the bandwidth of a system is flexible as in
E-UTRA.
For coexistence purposes the same channel bandwidth is selected for both the
aggressor and victim system. The selected bandwidth is 10 MHz.
A RB can be simultaneously used in the RN access link and the donor eNB.
### 6.7.1 Downlink
The eNB and the RN access link are assumed to be able to transmit at the full
bandwidth. Thus the ACIR is the same for all allocations.
The PSD of the transmitter is constant for all RB. The interference in the
adjacent channel is assumed to be flat, i.e to have constant PSD.
Figure 6.7.1-1 Adjacent channel interference for downlink.
The UE ACS is specified as 33 dB in 36.101 [6] and the eNB ACLR is 45 dB [7]..
The UE ACS is specified as 33 dB in 36.101 [6]. The ACIR values to be used for
downlinks are listed in Table 6.7-1. The Y in the table below is obtained by
combining the ACLR of the RN in the aggressor network and the ACS of the RN in
the victim network.

f(X,Y) = -10log(RN_DL_ACLR^-1^ + Relay_DL_ACS^-1^ )]
### 6.7.2 Uplink
In the uplink the transmissions are split into 1/3 of the channel BW. The ACLR
of the UE is 30 dB [6] and the ACS of the BS is 46 dB [8]. For transmissions
in adjacent blocks the value in Table 6.7-2 marked \"adjacent\" apply,
otherwise the other value applies.

## 6.8 Traffic assumptions
To simplify simulations relays in the same system are either transmitting or
receiving in a snapshot. I.e. one relay cannot transmit while another relay
receives if the relays belong to the same system.
The case with relays in both the victim and aggressor system is FFS. Thus
whether two relays that belong to different systems can transmit and receive
simultaneously is FFS.
### 6.8.1 Simulation case 1
Aggressor: eNB and RN access side, Victim link: eNB -> UE
Figure 6.8.1-1 Simulation case 1, eNB and RN in the aggressor system are
transmitting.
Figure 6.8.1-2 Simulation case 1, eNBs in the aggressor system are
transmitting.
In 50% of the snapshots:
\- All eNB in the aggressor system are transmitting. All eNB in the aggressor
system are transmitting at full BW
\- All the RN in the aggressor system are transmitting. All RN in the
aggressor system are transmitting full BW.
\- All eNB in the victim system are transmitting.
In 50% of the snapshots
\- All eNB in the aggressor system are transmitting. All eNB in the aggressor
system are transmitting at full BW
\- All eNB in the victim system are transmitting.
Throughput loss is measured in all eNB-UE links in the victim system.
### 6.8.2 Simulation case 2
Aggressor: UE and RN backhaul side, Victim link: UE -> eNB
Figure 6.8.2-1 Simulation case 2. RN in the aggressor system are transmitting.
Figure 6.8.2-2 Simulation case 2. UE in the aggressor system are transmitting.
In 50% of the snapshots:
\- In each donor cell in the aggressor system there are 3 actively
transmitting RN. The 3 RN are selected randomly from all the available RN in
the donor cell.
In 50% of the snapshots:
\- In each donor cell in the aggressor system there are 3 actively
transmitting UE. If there are more than 3 UEs in the donor cell, 3 UEs are
randomly selected that actively transmit.
\- In each relay cell in the aggressor system there are 1\~3 actively
transmitting UE. If there are more than 3 UEs in the relay cell, 3 UEs are
randomly selected that actively transmit. Regardless of the activated UE
number in the relay cell, each UE occupies 1/3 of total BW. To simulate the
worst case, the RBs should be assigned to the 1/3 bandwidth closest to the
victim system.
In each cell in the victim system there are 3 UEs actively transmitting. If
there are more than 3 UEs in the cell in the victim system, 3 UEs are randomly
selected that actively transmit.
The throughput loss is measured in all the UE-eNB links in the victim system.
### 6.8.3 Simulation case 3
Aggressor: eNB Victim link: eNB -> RN
Figure 6.8.3-1 Simulation case 3. eNBs in the aggressor system are
transmitting
All eNB in the aggressor system are transmitting. All eNB in the aggressor
system are transmitting at full BW
All eNB in the victim system are transmitting. All eNB in the victim system
are transmitting at full BW
All RN in the victim system are receiving.
The throughput loss is measured in all the eNB-RN links in the victim system.
### 6.8.4 Simulation case 4
Aggressor: UE, Victim link: UE-> RN
Figure 6.8.4-1 Simulation case 4. UE in the aggressor system are transmitting
In each cell in the aggressor system there are 3 UE transmitting. If there are
more than 3 UEs in the cell, 3 UEs are randomly selected that actively
transmit.
In the victim system there are 3 UE transmitting in each donor cell. If there
are more than 3 UEs in the donor cell, 3 UEs are randomly selected that
actively transmit.
In each relay cell there are 1\~3 UE transmitting. If there are more than 3
UEs in the relay cell, 3 UEs are randomly selected that actively transmit.
Regardless of the activated UE number in the relay cell, each UE just occupies
1/3 of total BW. To simulate the worst scenario, the 1/3 bandwidths are
randomly assigned to the UE(s).
The throughput loss is measured in all the UE-RN links in the victim system.
## 6.9 Performance measures
The standard shifted truncated Shannon limits defined in Annex A.2 of TS36.942
[5] are employed as the benchmark against which the co-existence performance
of relay nodes is to be evaluated.
The following equations approximate the throughput over a channel with a given
SNR, when using link adaptation:
Where: S(SNIR) is the Shannon bound: S(SNIR) = log2(1+SNIR) bps/Hz
α Attenuation factor, representing implementation losses
SNR~MIN~ Minimum SNIR of the codeset, dB
Thr~MAX~ Maximum throughput of the codeset, bps/Hz
SNIR~MAX~ SNIR at which max throughput is reached S-1(ThrMAX), dB
The parameters α, SNRMIN and THRMAX can be chosen to represent different modem
implementations and link conditions. The parameters Table 6.9.1 represent a
baseline case, which assumes:
\- 1:2 antenna configurations
\- Typical Urban fast fading channel model (10kmph DL, 3kmph UL)
\- Link Adaptation
\- Channel prediction
\- HARQ

# 7 Results
## 7.1 Coexistence results
For coexistence studies 48 cases have been defines as outlined in subclause
6.1. A complete set of results from the coexistence studies can be found in
[x]. Since there are so many data points a complete set is not shown in this
report, the acir value for 5% loss in the average and the 5^th^ percentile
throughput are shown in table 7.1-1 and 7.1-2. Note that the data used is from
RAN4-58, RAN4-58AH and RAN4-59 only since the simulation assumptions were
updated before that and thus the data prior to RAN4-58 is not consisten with
the data from later meetings.

# 9 Access link requirements
## 9.1 Transmitter
### 9.1.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in sub-section 9.1 are expressed for
a single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier transmission
with one or multiple transmitter antenna connectors, transmit diversity or
MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter antenna
connector.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
Relay antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers
for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external
apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices
is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B in figure
8.1.1-1).
Unless otherwise stated the access link requirements in sub-section 9.1
applies at all times, i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter
OFF period and the Transmitter transient period.

###### 10.2.2.2.4.2 Test procedure
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via R-PDCCH DCI format 2C for C_RNTI to transmit the DL
RMC according to Table 10.2.2.2.2.3-1 and Table 10.2.2.2.3-2. The details of
R-PDCCH and PDSCH are specified in Table B1.1.2-1 and R.4 TDD in Table C.2-2
respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. Set the parameters of the propagation condition, antenna configuration,
the correlation matrix and the SNR according to Table 10.2.2.2.5-1 as
appropriate.
3\. Measure the Pm-dsg for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G clause G.4 defined in TS 36.521-1[10]. Count
the number of NACKs, ACKs and statDTXs on the UL PUCCH during each subtest
interval. Pm-dsg is the ratio (statDTX)/(NACK+ACK+statDTX). If Pm-dsg is less
than the value specified in table 10.2.2.2.5-1, pass the RN. Otherwise fail
the RN.

###### ### Annex A: Propagation models for relay demodulation requirements
# A.1 Propagation models for backhaul link
## A.1.1 Delay Profiles
Three representative delay profiles are selected corresponding to the LOS and
NLOS scenarios.
### A.1.1.1 LOS between eNB and relay
Table A.1.1-1 and Table A.1.1-2 show the delay profiles for the LOS scenarios:
one with strong dominant component and the other with medium dominant
component. Note that the first tap in both Table A.1.1-1 and Table A.1.1-2
corresponds to the LOS component, it is therefore a non-fading tap and the
corresponding Doppler frequency is 0.
Table A.1.1-1 Delay Profile for LOS Scenario (strong dominant component)
+-------------------------+----------------+ | Excess tap delay [ns] | Relative power | | | | | | [dB] | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 0 | 0.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 30 | -21.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 70 | -22.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 90 | -23.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+
Note that as the first tap is at least 21dB stronger than the rest taps, this
channel may be considered as an AWGN channel. The exact one-tap static AWGN
channel model is FFS.
Table A.1.1-2 Delay Profile for LOS Scenario (medium dominant component)
+-------------------------+----------------+ | Excess tap delay [ns] | Relative power | | | | | | [dB] | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 0 | 0.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 30 | -11.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 70 | -12.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 90 | -13.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 110 | -18.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 190 | -27.2 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | [410] | [-30.8] | +-------------------------+----------------+
Note that as the first tap is at least 11dB stronger than the rest taps, this
channel may be characterized by one dominant path combined with significant
scattering paths.
### A.1.1.2 NLOS between eNB and relay
For NLOS scenario, the delay profile is given in Table A.1.1-3.
Table A.1.1-3 Delay Profile for NLOS Scenario
+-------------------------+----------------+ | Excess tap delay [ns] | Relative power | | | | | | [dB] | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 0 | 0.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 30 | -1.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 70 | -2.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 90 | -3.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 110 | -8.0 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 190 | -17.2 | +-------------------------+----------------+ | 410 | -20.8 | +-------------------------+----------------+
## A.1.2 Doppler Frequency
For NLOS between the eNB and the relay, as the relay nodes are often fixed,
hence a low Doppler frequency of 2Hz is used. Note that this 2Hz Doppler
frequency is only used for the new channels (such as R-PDCCH).
## A.1.3 MIMO Correlation Matrices
For LOS component between the eNB and the relay, the spatial channel
correlation matrix is modeled as an all one matrix unless cross-polarized
antennas are deployed. This is because the correlation matrix for the channel
with single LOS component is of rank 1.
For NLOS scenario, the correlation matrices are given in the following tables.
Table A.1.3-1 defines the correlation matrices for the eNB:

{width="2.0368055555555555in" height="1.2229166666666667in"}
* * *
Table A.1.3-2 defines the correlation matrices for the relay:

Table A.1.3-3 Low, Medium and High Correlation Values
* * *
Low correlation Medium Correlation High Correlation  
α β α β α β 0 0 0.3 0.9 0.9 0.9
* * *
For the channel from the eNB to the relay, the channel spatial correlation
matrix $R_{\text{spat}}$ is then given as the Kronecker product of the eNB
correlation matrix and the relay correlation matrix, i.e. $R_{\text{spat}} =
R_{\text{eNB}} \otimes R_{\text{Re}\text{lay}}$.
# A.2 multipath propagation fading conditions for access link
Tables A.2-1 -- Table A.2-3 show multi-path delay profiles that are used for
the performance measurements in multi-path fading environment. All taps have
classical Doppler spectrum, defined as:
(CLASS) {width="1.7777777777777777in" height="0.25in"} for _f_ ∈ -_fD_ , _fD_.

* * *
A multipath fading propagation condition is defined by a combination of a
multi-path delay profile and a maximum Doppler frequency _f~D~_ which is
either 5, 70 or 300 Hz.
Note that the ETU model shown in Table A.2-3 and Doppler frequency of 300Hz
are optional for relay access link demodulation requirments.
The relay access link demodulation requirements are the same or subset of the
eNB requirements as described in TS 36.104.

# B.2 OCNG patterns for R-PDCCH performance requirements
The following OCNG patterns are used for modelling allocations to virtual UEs
(which are not under test) and/or allocations used for MBSFN. The OCNG pattern
for each sub frame specifies the allocations that shall be filled with OCNG,
and furthermore, the relative power level of each such allocation.
In each test case the OCNG is expressed by parameters OCNG_RA and OCNG_RB
which together with a relative power level ($\gamma$) specifies the PDSCH
EPRE-to-RS EPRE ratios in OFDM symbols with and without reference symbols,
respectively. The relative power, which is used for modelling boosting per
virtual UE allocation, is expressed by:
where $\gamma_{i}$ denotes the relative power level of the i:th virtual UE.
The parameter settings of OCNG_RA, OCNG_RB, and the set of relative power
levels $\gamma$are chosen such that when also taking allocations to the UE
under test into account, as given by a PDSCH reference channel, a constant
transmitted power spectral density that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is
targeted.
Moreover the OCNG pattern is accompanied by a PCFICH/PDCCH/PHICH reference
channel which specifies the control region. For any aggregation and PHICH
allocation, the PDCCH and any unused PHICH groups are padded with resource
element groups with a power level given respectively by PDCCH_RA/RB and
PHICH_RA/RB as specified in the test case such that a total power spectral
density in the control region that is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is
targeted.

###### ### Annex C: Physical Channel Set-up for conformance tests
# C.1 Set-up for R-PDCCH
Table C.1-1 is applicable for demodulation performance requirements in which
uniform RS-to-EPRE boosting for R-PDCCH.
Table C.1-1: Downlink Physical Channels transmitted during a connection (FDD
and TDD)
* * *
Physical Channel EPRE Ratio Note R-PDCCH R-PDCCH_RA = ρ~A~  
R-PDCCH_RB = ρ~B~  
PDSCH PDSCH_RA = ρ~A~  
PDSCH_RB = ρ~B~
* * *
NOTE 1: ρ~A~= ρ~B~ = 0 dB means no RS boosting.
NOTE 2: ρ~A~ denotes the ratio of PDSCH EPRE to cell-specific RS EPRE among
PDSCH REs in all the OFDM symbols not containing cell-specific RS. ρ~B~
denotes the ratio of PDSCH EPRE to cell-specific RS EPRE among PDSCH REs in
all the OFDM symbols containing cell-specific RS.
The power allocation for OFDM symbols and reference signals is the same as
defined in Annex C.3.2 in TS36.521-1 [10].
The PDCCH aggregation level for R-PDCCH demodulation tests is 8 CCE-s.
