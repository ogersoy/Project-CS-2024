# 4 Background
The switch off of analogue television (Digital Dividend) will make available
for IMT services a portion of the UHF spectrum in Region 3. In other regions
the switch to digital television will also create a digital dividend that may
be used for IMT services.
At the ninth meeting of the APT Wireless Forum (AWF-9), held in Seoul, Korea
from September 13th to 16th 2010, agreement was reached on two harmonized
frequency arrangements for IMT in the 698-806 MHz frequency band in Region 3.
This agreement is the result of extensive studies undertaken by Region 3
administrations, network operators and manufacturers of equipment, user
devices and electronic components, following the decisions taken WRC-07. [2]
The agreed FDD arrangement is: Uplink: 703-748 MHz, Downlink 758-803 MHz, i.e.
2x45 MHz.
The agreed TDD arrangement is: 698-806 MHz, i.e. 1x108 MHz. However APT notes
that "a minimum internal guard-band of 5 MHz at the lower edge (698 MHz) and 3
MHz at the upper edge (806 MHz) needs to be considered".
The AWF-9 meeting also invited further studies to determine UE out-of-band
emission limits and implementation issues relating to the usage of the band
698-806 MHz by the Mobile Service. The APT Wireless Group (AWG)[^1] is
continuing these studies and plans to finalize them in the 11^th^ meeting of
AWG in October 2011.
Note that studies on implementation issues for countries which cannot make the
whole band 698-806MHz available and therefore cannot apply the APT-agreed
arrangements but will use some part of the frequency arrangement should be
conducted in order to suit their national considerations, which will
consequently allow more deployments using the APT-agreed arrangements in
various countries.
The purpose of this work item is to:
● Study the technical requirements for deploying LTE in the band 698-806 MHz
in region 3, e.g. coexistence requirements with service in adjacent frequency
bands, considering the on-going work in the AWG. Both TDD and FDD should be
considered.
● Develop channel arrangements for LTE in the band 698-806 MHz in line with
the APT decision for region 3 and the study above. Both TDD and FDD should be
considered.
● Develop technical requirements for deployment of LTE in the band 698-806
MHz, considering implementation issues for countries which cannot make the
whole band 698-806MHz available and therefore cannot apply the APT-agreed
arrangements but will use some part of the channel arrangement. Both TDD and
FDD should be considered.
● Consider possible deployment in region 2 outside of US.
● Generate CR's to update the appropriate documents
# 5 Frequency band arrangements and regulatory background
## 5.1 Adjacent 3GPP bands
In figure 5.1-1 an overview of the already standardised 3GPP frequency bands
is given. However some of the bands are regional or local and thus the
coexistence situation is slightly different in different regions and
countries.
We can see that for all the adjacent 3GPP bands the new band has a downlink
allocated next to an uplink of the already standardised bands. Thus there will
may be interference from the BS of the new band into the BS of the already
standardized bands. In addition there may be interference from UEs in the
already defined bands into UEs for the new band.
Figure 5.1-1 Overview of adjacent bands defined by 3GPP
In table 5.1-1 we give some further details on where bands are used and the
frequency separation between the new band and the already existing bands.

2011), but band not in standard
* * *
## 5.2 Services below the band
Below the new band the spectrum is mainly allocated to broadcasting. There are
four different digital TV standards used in the regions (ATSC, DTMB, DVB-T/T"
and ISDB-T). In addition there are three different channel rasters used (6,7
and 8 MHz). In figure 5.2-1 an overview of the frequency arrangement is given
for the countries where the band below 698 MHz will be freed up by the
transision to digital TV technology. However, there would be some countries
which cannot make the whole band 698-806MHz available for the mobile service
even after the digtail TV transision. For example, Japan will have the channel
arrangement for digital TV as shown in figure 5.2-2. In table 5.2-1 further
details are given some of the countries in the region.
Figure 5.2-1 Channel arrangements for digital TV below the band
Figure 5.2-2 Channel arrangements for digital TV in Japan
The main interference paths are from a FDD and TDD UE uperating in the new
band to digital TV receivers. In addition there will be interference from TDD
BS to TV receivers. The TV transmitter may create interfere at the BS receiver
in the new band.

### 5.2.1 AWG decisions on emissions
In the report "IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF THE BAND 698-806
MHZ BY MOBILE SERVICES" [5] AWG have studied coexistence with TV services
extensively. In the conclusion the following is stated:
> _"As a result of the probabilistic, deterministic and empirical studies it
> is considered that the probability of interference to adjacent digital
> television receivers below 694 MHz from IMT UE would be low when the UE
> maximum out-of-band emissions were between ‑30 and ‑40 dBm/MHz (averaged
> over the DTV bandwidth)._
>
> _Considering technical and economic factors associated with UE equipment, it
> was concluded that the average out of band emissions of IMT UE, measured
> over the bandwidth of the applicable television channel in the country of
> deployment, must not exceed -34 dBm/MHz below 694 MHz ._
>
> _To further reduce the probability of interference in certain cases, such as
> where digital television broadcasting services are operating immediately
> below 694 MHz, Administrations may wish to implement, on a local basis,
> network and operational deployment measures. This discretionary approach
> would have the effect of further lowering the emissions into the adjacent
> broadcast band below 694 MHz by up to 6 dB. This would have no impact on the
> IMT UE handset specifications or roaming requirements and can be achieved
> solely through network implementation by operators._
>
> _For countries which have 6 MHz broadcast channel raster, if it is found
> that additional coexistence conditions are needed, they should be considered
> in an amendment to this report."_
Thus we can expect the emission requirements for TV protection to be -34
dBm/MHz below 694 MHz with an averaging bandwidth of 6, 7 or 8 MHz. In certain
countries the emission level may be as low as -40 dBm/MHz in certain
countries. Finally for countries which use 6 MHz TV channels AWG may consider
further requirements.
## 5.3 Services above the band
There are different services deployed above the band. In table 5.3-1 some
services are listed. Some of the standards used for trunked radio is iDEN and
TETRA.

# 7 General issues
## 7.1 TDD frequency arrangement
The frequency arrangement for TDD should be aligned with the outer ends of the
FDD arrangement i.e. the frequency arrangement for TDD is:
\- 703-803 MHz
## 7.2 Co-existence with nearby 3GPP bands
Figure 7.2-1 shows the 3GPP spectrum around APT700. Band 5/V, Band 18 and Band
19/XIX are legacy bands being deployed, thus impact in current performance
needs to be specifically addressed. Band 26 and lower E850 sub-band are bands
being standarized at the same time as APT700.
Figure 7.2-1. 3GPP spectrum around 700 MHz in APAC
### 7.2.1 Co-existence with lower E850 sub-band
Lower E850 UL is situated 4 MHz from APT700 FDD DL and APT700 TDD, as shown in
Figure 7.2-1.
For the APT700 and lower E850 BS co-existence scenario, the following issues
should be considered:
\- APT700 LTE BS TX OOBE **__** Lower E850 LTE BS Receiver
\- APT700LTE BS TX Power **__** Lower E850 LTE BS Receiver (ACS, blocking)
The spurious emission requirement for co-existence with BS operating in lower
E850 is -49dBm/MHz. Assuming ACLR1 and ACLR2 is equal to 45dB, the BS RF
filter will need to attenuate 40dB. In addition, the BS TX filter should be
able to provide enough attenuation in order to protect its own UL.
The interfering signal for lower E850 BS receiver with 6dB degradation is
-52dBm for ACS and -43dBm for in-band blocking requirements. Assuming a BS
output power is 43 dBm/5MHz, and MCL=67 dB, the interfering signal into lower
E850 UL is -24 dBm/5MHz. Therefore additional 28dB and 19dB rejection is
needed in the filter to meet the ACS and in-band blocking requirements are
required respectively. The more realistic assumption is 1 dB desense for BS,
the corresponding allowed interference power adjusts to be -63dBm and -54dBm
respectively. Hence the required attenuation is 39 dB for adjacent protection
and 30 dB for other in-band channels protection.
Regarding the BS co-existence issues between APT700 MHz and lower E850 bands,
filter capability is an important factor. From the investigation R4-122788, it
can be concluded that there exists possible solutions to solve the co-
existence issues between lower E850 and APT700. Lower E850 Rx filter can
provide enough attenuation to fulfil ACS and in band-blocking. By using
certain specific solutions, sub-band filters as an example, APT700 can protect
lower E850 UL with the standard level of -49dBm/MHz.
### 7.2.2 Co-existence with Band 26/XXVI
The frequency distance between Band 26/XXVI UL and APT700 FDD DL and APT700
TDD is 11 MHz, see Figure 7.2-1.
BS-BS
Band 26/XXVI UL is located in the spurious emissions region of APT700.
Therefore, co-existence is possible and the common protection limits from
APT700 towards Band 26 UL, i. e. -49 dBm/MHz can be reused.
Band 26/XXVI blocking requirement at 803 MHz is specified as 6 dB degradation
for a -43/-40 dBm blocking signal. Considering MCL=67 dB (co-existence) and a
BS transmitting at 43dBm, the blocking signal into Band 26 is -24dBm. An extra
attenuation of 19/16 dB is needed which is feasible at such frequency.
BS-BS co-existence between Band 26/XXVI and APT700 is not an issue
UE-UE
Band 26/XXVI UE emissions into APT700 have been defined as -50dBm/MHz
\@703-799 MHz and -40 dBm/MHz \@799-803 MHz [7].
### 7.2.3 Co-existence with Band 5/V
Band 5/V UL, is situated 21 MHz from APT700 FDD UL and APT700 TDD, as shown in
Figure 7.2-1
BS-BS
Co-existence between BSs is not a problem in this scenario due to the large
frequency separation. APT700 FDD DL and APT700 TDD emissions at Band 5/V
frequency range are defined as spurious emissions. The DL spurious emissions
to protect Band 5 UL can be defined as the common spurious emission
requirement for co-existence -49dBm/MHz since the frequency separation is
large enough to allow the BS to limit its emissions to this level.
Band 5 UL blocking requirement \@803 MHz is currently enough to co-exist with
APT700. The current requirement at that frequency is the general out of band
blocking, -15 dBm blocking signal and 6 dB degradation, which is based on a
co-existence scenario as defined in [4].
BS-BS co-existence between Band 5/V and APT700 is not an issue
UE-UE
UE-UE coexistence is facilitated by the 21 MHz separation. For OOB emissions
from a Band 5 aggressor into the APT700 DL the Band 5 duplexer must provide an
additional attenuation of the order of 10 dB in order to meet the standard -50
dBm/MHz requirement in the victim band. This rejection is supplied by many
implementations. It is noted that A-MPR cannot be defined for Band 5 in order
to reduce unwanted emissions.
UE-UE co-existence between Band 5/V and APT700 is not an issue
### 7.2.4 Co-existence with Band 18 and 19/XIX
Band 18 UL and Band 19/XIX UL are situated 12 and 27 MHz from APT700 FDD DL
and APT700 TDD, as shown in Figure 7.2-1.
BS-BS
The situation for band 19/XIX is similar to band 5/V. The difference is that
the band is narrower and that the frequency separation is larger. Thus the
same conclusions as for band 5/V can be made.
The applicable blocking requirement for Band 18 UL \@803 MHz is in band
blocking, -43 dBm blocking signal and 6 dB degradation. Considering a BS with
46 dBm output power, and MCL=67 dB, the blocking signal into Band 18 UL is -21
dBm. The signal needs to be reduced by 20 dB at Band 18 UL BS @ 803 MHz, which
is feasible since the frequency separation is large.
BS-BS co-existence between Band 18 and 19/XIX and APT700 is achievable.
UE-UE
UE-UE coexistence is not an issue for Band 19. However, it may be a challenge
for Band 18 with 12 MHz separation.
Table 7.2.4-1 shows data from a Band 18+5 duplexer from a filter vendor. We
can observe that the minimum attenuation of a Band 18+5 duplexer is 28 dB at
803 MHz, while the typical attenuation is 38 dB.

Considering that Band 18 is a legacy band and A-MPR cannot be defined and
assuming LO and image rejection as 25 dBc, simulations indicate that -40
dBm/MHz is reachable without A-MPR for a 15 MHz E-UTRA carrier (while -50
dBm/MHz is possible to achieve for smaller channel bandwidths)
As conclusion, the emissions from Band 18 to protect APT700 can be defined as
follows from Rel-11 and onwards:
o -50 dBm/MHz \@703-799 MHz
o -40 dBm/MHz \@799-803 MHz
## 7.3 Co-existence with TV broadcasting
Based on the TV broadcasting protection limits specified by the regulatory
bodies (chapter 5.2.1 and 5.2.2), the APT700 FDD UE emission limits are:
o -26.2 dBm/6 MHz in the frequency range TBD-694 MHz for any E-UTRA carrier
within 703-748 MHz with up to 20 MHz bandwidth. No A-MPR is required.
o -26.2 dBm/6 MHz in the frequency range TBD-710 MHz for any E-UTRA carrier
located above 718 MHz for 5 and 10 MHz channel bandwidth. No A-MPR is required
According to AWG, there is no requirement in the frequency range of
694\~698MHz. For the frequency range from 692 -- 698 MHz, to maintain
consistency with the requirements below 694 MHz the emission limit is set to:
o -26.2 dBm/6 MHz in the frequency range 692-698 MHz for any E-UTRA carrier
within 703-748 MHz with up to 20 MHz bandwidth
Simulations have shown that the following A-MPR is needed to fulfil
-26.2dBm/6MHz, at 692-698 MHz.

Channel bandwidth (MHz) Resources Blocks (_N_ ~RB~) A-MPR (dB) 5 ≥ 2 ≤ 1 10,

* * *
APT700 TDD
o -25 dBm/8 MHz in the frequency range TBD-694 MHz for any E-UTRA carrier
within 703-803 MHz with up to 20 MHz bandwidth. Up to 2.5 dB at full
allocation and about 1.5 dB for single RB allocation is needed for 15 and 20
MHz and around 1 dB for full allocation for 10 MHz. No A-MPR is required for 3
and 5 MHz.
### 7.3.1 A-MPR for TV broadcasting protection
Simulations to study the backoff (A-MPR) needed to comply with the agreed
APT700 FDD UE emissions towards DTV were conducted considering the following
assumptions:
\- PA with UTRA ACLR1 = 33dB
\- LO leakage, IQ image rejection = -28 dBc
\- CIM3 = -60dBc
#### 7.3.1.1 APT700 FDD UE emissions below 694 MHz
Simulations have shown that A-MPR is not needed for any E-UTRA channel
bandwidth to fulfill -26.2dBm/6 MHz. As example, emissions from a 20 MHz
E-UTRA carrier averaged over 6 MHz are shown in Figure 7.3.1.1-1. It can be
seen that emissions at 694 MHz are below -26.2 dBm/6MHz for 1 RB and full
allocation, Simulations assume 15 dB filter rejection at such frequency,
according to filter data in subclause 8.1.1.

Figure 7.3.1.1-1. Emissions from a 20 MHz E-UTRA carrier located at 703-723
MHz
#### 7.3.1.2 APT700 FDD UE emissions below 710 MHz
The UE duplexer is assumed to be a dual duplexer, DUP1: 703-733/758-788 MHz
and DUP2: 718-748/773-803 MHz, refer to chapter 8.1.1. DUP2 can achieve an
attenuation of 15dB at 710 MHz. and the frequency separation between the edge
of DUP2 towards 710 Mhz is comparable to the distance between DUP1 and 694
MHz. Therefore, Figure 7.3.1.1-1 can also be used to conclude that A-MPR is
not needed for protection below 710 MHz
#### 7.3.1.3 APT700 TDD UE emissions below 694 MHz
A-MPR simulations to fulfill -25dBm/8MHz assuming no filter rejection at 694
MHz are presented in Figure 7.3.1.3-1 to Figure 7.3.1.3-3. Up to 2.5 dB A-MPR
is needed at full allocation for 15 and 20 MHz and about 1.5 dB for single RB
allocation. A back-off of about 1 dB is required for full allocation for 10
MHz. 3 and 5 MHz do not require any A-MPR

Results from Table 7.3.2-1 are presented in graphical form in Figure 7.3.2-3
where measured TV transmission power is presented as a function of distance
from TV tower. When studying the graph there are two issues which are good to
mention.
Firstly typically in areas close to TV transmitter i.e. distance \< 1 km the
TV transmission antenna pattern is such that only the side lobes point toward
ground, this causes the signal power to fluctuate considerable when reception
antenna position is moving. This can be seen in the measurement graph as a big
variation in received power.
Secondly because TV transmission antennas are located in very high masts,
antennas are slightly tilted downwards toward densely populated areas. This
can be seen on results as a measured signal power level increase on distances
between 10 and 15 km. This distance appears to be the area where the highest
antenna gain points to.
Pink curve presents the TV repeater signal strength. Repeater was located in
different position than the DTV broadcasting transmitter therefore the signal
streght vs. distance reults are different.

Figure 7.3.2-4 UE antenna port received power
For the Figure 7.3.2-4 firstly we have calculated the average of measured
values in each test location. For a couple of points one result is discarded
because it varied too much from the general level.
Secondly we have scaled the curves for more useful antenna gain values.
Antenna gain values in graph are
\- 0 dBi for reference
\- -6 dBi representing a UE free space antenna gain (lap top)
\- -10 dBi representing a UE beside the head antenna gain (speech position)
When considering the -- 6 dBi and -- 10 dBi antenna gain graphs we can note
that the maximum expected TV signal power in UE input is roughly -- 30 dBm or
below.
Conclusion
We have presented results of measurements where it was studied how much live
TV transmission (50 kW ERP) couples to UE antenna port when TV transmissions
are located next to mobile band and UE antenna can be assumed to be tuned also
for TV band. Measurements were performed in live TV network were both analogue
(600 kW ERP) and digital TV(50 kW ERP) transmissions were present. Results
indicate that maximum TV signal power in UE antenna port is approximately --
30 dBm.
## 7.4 Co-existence with PPDR and TETRA systems
iDEN is one type of Land Mobile Radio systems that is commonly deployed in
Latin America, where the APT700 MHz band is being seriously considered. iDEN
is also deployed in Korea. The iDEN radio uplink is in the band 806-824 MHz.
iDEN radios use 25 kHz channels. While some models of iDEN mobiles can
transmit up to 30 dBm, the typical iDEN mobile can transmit up to 28 dBm. iDEN
handsets usually have an external stub antenna with a typical gain of 2 dB.
## 7.5 Coexistence with GPS, Compass/Beidou-2 and Galileo
The second harmonics of APT700 TDD UE(s) transmissions may overlap with
navigation signals in the allocated in the frequency range 1559-1610 MHz
(Radio Navigation Satellite and Aeronautical Radio Navigation). In particular,
for Compass/BeiDou-2, we have the
● 1. E2 signal centered at 1561.098 MHz with 2.046 Mchip/s rate
● 2. E1 signal centered at 1589.74 MHz with 2.046 Mchip/s rate
These signals cover the band 1559.052\~1591.788 MHz and are part of a set of
signals (also in other bands) intended for both civilian and military use. For
GPS we have the
● 1. L1 signal centered at 1575.42 MHz for the civilian L1C code and the
M-code (10.23 Mchip/s)
The Galileo signals in the range overlap with Beidou-2 and GPS and are also
denoted E2-L1-E1. These are used for both Open Services (OS) and Public
Regulated Services (PRS) available to authorized users by government for e.g.
emergency services.
It is clear that the UE must comply with regulatory requirements and thus the
terminal manufacturer has to ensure compliance. However it is unclear what the
regulatory requirements will be in the regions where the TDD allocation is
used. Furthermore it is noted that the FCC requirements are EIRP based which
makes conversion to conducted requirements challenging.
It is expected that filters are necessary to reduce the emissions in the RNSS
band. Filters generally have losses and in order to accommodate a filter in
the UE design a relaxation is needed to enable the manufacturer to comply with
regulatory requirements. Since the regulatory status is unclear no explicit
requirements will be included in the specification. However the requirements
should be set to enable inclusion of filters in the design.
# 8 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 UE duplexer
### 8.1.1 FDD dual duplexer
APT700 FDD plan is defined as a 45 MHz wide band. The current state-of-art
allows an implementation of a single duplexer with a bandwidth equal to 3-4%
the centre frequency, which leads to 30MHz in the case of APT700 FDD.
Therefore, a possible implementation of the filter could be a dual duplexer of
30 MHz bandwidth each duplexer and 15 MHz overlap. This configuration would
put a restriction on the 20 MHz carrier, which will not be able to be placed
at centre frequencies between 723.1 and 727.9 MHz.
To be able to place a 20 MHz carrier anywhere within the passband, a dual
duplexer with 32.5 MHz passband and 20 MHz overlap is needed. However, the
filter becomes more challenging.
Filter data from different UE vendors for both dual duplexer configurations
are shown in Table 8.1.1-1 and Table 8.1.1-2 considering protection of
adjacent services (TV \@694 MHz following AWG recommendation, -34dBm/MHz) and
own DL operating band as well as rejection against UL blockers in its own
band. This data is preliminary and just indicate the performance difference
between the two possible dual duplexers.

Some regions, as e.g. Japan, cannot have the complete APT700 FDD designated to
wideband systems since TV is allocated up to 710 MHz [6]. A duplexer
configuration 2x32.5 MHz may put very stringent requirements on AMPR since the
rejection from the filter will be lower than in case of 2x30 MHz.
#### 8.1.1.1 FDD dual duplexer assumption for UE requirements
The most suitable dual duplexer assumption to fit AWG frequency arrangement as
well as Japanese regional arrangement is 2x30 MHz. At the same time, the in-
band performance of this filter is better than for a 2x32.5 MHz for the same
stop band requirements. The only constraint is that it does not support a 20
MHz E-UTRA carrier for centre frequencies between 723.1 and 727.9 MHz.
However, assuming that the spectrum is auctioned in chunks of 5 MHz, this will
most likely not happen. Therefore, an assumption of 2x30 MHz is taken to
define the UE requirements.
Optimization for a 2x30 MHz duplexer is still needed in order to define
appropriate UE requirements.
### 8.1.2. TDD filter
## 8.2 UE Transmitter Requirements
### 8.2.1 FDD
For the UE transmitter minimum requirements we assume a split-duplexer
arrangement with a 30 MHz passband and characteristics according to Tables
8.1.1-1 and 8.1.1-2. However, this arrangement should not be specified in TS
36.101, which means that the minimum requirements apply for the entire
frequency range 703-748/758-803 MHz. In specifying the tolerance for the
maximum output power, special consideration is given to protection of
\- broadcast below 694 MHz (Section 7.3)
\- broadcast below 710 MHz in Japan (Section 7.3)
\- the own RX (758-803 MHz).
#### 8.2.1.1 Maximum output power
The split-duplexer architecture in Figure 8.2.1.1-1 is similar to those
already used in designs for the 850/900 MHz range in which one low-band PA is
shared e.g. Band 5 and Band 8. Hence, when comparing the front-end loss in
different frequency ranges, one should account for the fact that additional
switches in the TX part are accounted for also in 850 MHz designs that are
subject to the standard 23 dBm ±2 dB requirement. It is recognised that the
arrangement in Figure 8.2.1.1-1 consumes one extra port in the antenna switch,
at the expense of support of another operating band.
For the tolerance limits, we observe that the provisionally specified IL for
the lower DPX1 filter and upper DPX2 filter is around 3.5 dB (specified),
which is similar to the corresponding specified values for Band 20 (around 3.5
dB [8]), which has the same passband width and similar duplex gap but smaller
relative bandwidth. Band 20 also allows a TC relaxation at the band edges.
From the duplexer data in Tables 8.1.1-1 and 8.1.1-2 for the TX IL it is
therefore relevant to consider either the standard ±2 dB for the mid-band
performance with ∆T~C~ relaxation is applied at the band edges (additional 1.5
dB) or consider a flat-out relaxation of the lower tolerance limit.
Figure 8.2.1.1-1: basic split-duplexer approach (DPX1 and DPX2) using only one
antenna-switch port.
For band-edge performance, it is reasonable to consider a relaxation using at
the band edges in order to facilitate compliance with broadcast protection
requirements and protection of the own RX. In particular, a relaxation at the
lower edge would allow possibilities for eliminating the need for A-MPR for
coexistence below 694 MHz (DPX1) by means of a steeper filter response and
increased stop-band rejection of DPX1, and a relaxation at the upper edge a
more stringent emission limit for protection of the lower range of the own RX
at the upper edge by means of DPX2.
A-MPR is not needed for protection of broadcast below 694 MHz assuming a -26.2
dBm/6MHz limit due to the rejection supplied by the DPX1 filter. The stop-band
requirement below 694 MHz is then 15 dB, and it is therefore relevant to
consider a modest relaxation of the output power at the lower edge rather than
the 1.5 dB relaxation that would be allowed by a ∆T~C~ at the lower edge. For
protection of the own receive band, duplexer data indicates that a protection
level below --[32] dBm/MHz is feasible at a specified TX IL in the range
3.5-5.0 dB for the DPX2, which motivates a relaxation of the output power at
the upper edge.
The coexistence requirement for protection of broadcast below 710 MHz in Japan
could motivate a mid-band TC relaxation at the lower edge of DPX2 to allow a
steeper filter response below 718 MHz. However, this local requirement would
then allow a relaxation of the output power performance for all other markets.
The relaxation at the band edges 703 MHz and 748 MHz could also facilitate
future development of a single duplexer for the band. Now, a single DPX may
not be at all feasible; implementation of the split-duplexer arrangement is
already challenging in high-volume SAW technique.
In view of the stop-band requirements above 758 MHz for protection of own
receive and the DTV protection below 694 MHz, it may be reasonable to adopt a
maximum output power of +23 dBm +2/-[2.5] dB as a compromise between filter
requirements (power consumption) and the impact on uplink coverage. This is
shown in Table 8.2.1.1-1 along with the corresponding for Band 12 (also in the
700 MHz range), Band 20 and Band 22 as comparison, where the latter also
assumes split-duplexer arrangement for requirement due to a challenging duplex
arrangement.

### 8.2.2. TDD
Before starting we make some general remarks on the specification for TDD:
\- the minimum requirements should apply for the entire frequency range
703-803 MHz,
\- any possible filter arrangement is not specified just as for FDD, but may
be assumed for the requirements,
\- support of 20 MHz bandwidth,
\- protection of broadcast below 694/698 MHz (section 7.3),
The requirements discussed below are based on limited filter data, and are
subject to changes when the band is due for deployment.
#### 8.2.2.1 Maximum output power
First we look at the impact of the unwanted emissions requirements on the MOP
specification and possible need for band edge relaxations. Filter help is not
readily at hand: a band-pass filter for the entire 100 MHz range is
challenging even if a filter bank is used, but other more feasible filter
solutions may work in view of the coexistence scenarios.
Considering unwanted emissions at the lower band edge
• ∆T~C~ need not be introduced for protection of broadcast below 694 MHz, the
A-MPR is still modest for compliance with -26.6 dBm/6MHz or -25 dBm/8MHz
requirement below 694 MHz also without additional filter rejection.
For the upper band edge
• no ∆T~C~ need not be introduced for protection of higher bands (see Figure
1), the closest protected band above the passband is still at around \~ 50 MHz
separation.
A low-pass filter can possibly be used to suppress emissions into the higher
bands, see Figure 8.2.2.1-1, and relaxation of the maximum output power
requirements could also be introduced for improved blocking rejection at
either edge if a bidirectional TX/RX RF filter is used (for close-in
interferers), see Section 8.3.2.2.
Figure 8.2.2.1-1: suppression of UE spurious emissions
Radio Navigation Satellite Services (RNSS that includes GPS and
Beidou-2/Compass) may have to be protected: the second harmonics of TDD
transmissions fall into the range 1559-1592 MHz used for open services,
Section 7.5. To accommodate the increased IL a modification of the lower
tolerance of the MOP for the APT700 TDD band should be allowed: tentatively
+23 dBm +2/[-3] dB for power class 3. This would also allow filtering to
improve coexistence with high bands as shown in Figure 8.2.2.1-1 should this
design option be chosen.
The maximum output power requirement is shown in Table 8.2.2.1-1 along with
the requirements for other TDD bands.

## 8.3 UE receiver requirements
### 8.3.1 FDD
For the UE receiver minimum requirements we assume a split-duplexer
arrangement with 30 MHz and characteristics according to Tables 8.1.1-1 and
8.1.1-2, but we assume that the minimum requirements apply for the entire
frequency range 703-748/758-803 MHz just as for the transmitter requirements.
We also assume that the constituent filters DPX1 and DPX2 of the split-
duplexer arrangement cannot be selected by the network: this selection is UE
implementation specific.
#### 8.3.1.1 REFSENS
For estimating reference sensitivity we do not apply scaling of WCDMA
requirements by the bandwidth like for many other operating bands. One
alternative is to assume that the thermal noise contribution excluding
transmitter noise is
$\text{Vn} = L_{\text{ANT} - \text{RX}}\text{NF}_{\text{RFIC}}$
where L~ANT-RX~ and NF~RFIC~ is the attenuation from the antenna to the LNA
and the noise factor of the RFIC, respectively. For simplicity we assume that
the noise contribution is the same on both RX branches since different
architectures, diversity or UL MIMO, must be covered by the minimum
requirement. We then add the impact of the transmitter noise for these
configurations and pick the worst case as dimensioning.
For the transmitter noise, we assume the standard test configuration with the
UL PRB allocation located at the upper edge of the TX band, the worst case.
The purpose of the test is to verify the noise factor, and recognising that
the transmitter noise may be smaller if a PRB allocation of the same size is
allocated away from the upper edge.
The requirement should apply for a standard diversity receiver with one main
TX/RX branch and one diversity RX, whence the SNR is
$\text{SNR} = \frac{\left| s \right|^{2}}{\text{Vn} + \text{Vt}} +
\frac{\left| s \right|^{2}}{\text{Vn} + \left| c \right|^{2}\text{Vt}}$
assuming standard MRC expression can be used, and
$\text{SNR} \approx \frac{\left| s \right|^{2}}{\text{Vn} + \left| c
\right|^{2}\text{Vt}}$
when the transmitter noise is dominating (correlated noise). Here V _t_
denotes the transmitter noise and _c_ the attenuation between the TX/RX
branches in a conductive test. We then have$P_{\text{REFSENS}} = \left| s
\right|^{2}$ at the minimum SNR.
The requirements should also apply for 2 TX for a UE supporting UL MIMO, hence
$\text{SNR} = \frac{\left| s \right|^{2}}{\text{Vn} + \text{Vt}_{1}} +
\frac{\left| s \right|^{2}}{\text{Vn} + \text{Vt}_{2}}$
assuming that the UE is configured for dual-codeword transmission
(uncorrelated transmitter noise), with V _t_ ~1~ and V _t_ ~2~ the transmitter
noise of the two transmitters. The total output power at the antenna port is
up to 23 dBm (nominal).
The transmitter noise is estimated as
$\text{Vt} = P_{\text{TX}}a_{\text{TX} - \text{RX}}^{-
1}\text{ACLR}_{\text{RX}}^{- 1}L_{\text{ANT} - \text{RX}}$
where a~TX-RX~ and ACLR~RX~ is s the duplexer isolation\@RX and the noise
falling into the receive bandwidth, respectively. Following the data in Tables
8.1.1-1 and 8.1.1-2 we assume a~TX-RX~ = 45 dB. The ACLR~RX~ is shown in Table
8.3.1.1-1 for various UL allocations.
Table 8.3.1.1-1 ACLR~RX~ (dBc) for various UL allocations
+--------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | E-UTRA Band | 10 MHz | 15 MHz | 20 MHz | +--------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | APT700 | [99.2] (15 RB) | [81.8] (15 RB)^1^ | [71.9] (15 RB)^1^ | | | | | | | | [94.4] (20 RB) | [84.5] (20 RB) | [75.0] (20 RB) | | | | | | | | [88.7] (25 RB) | [81.9] (25 RB) | [73.9] (25 RB) | +--------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | NOTE 1: MPR = 0 dB | | | | +--------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
The 20 MHz bandwidth is challenging; the TX-RX separation is only 35 MHz
(duplex separation 55 MHz), close to the OOB boundary of the uplink carrier
which is 25 MHz for the 20 MHz bandwidth. This can be compared to 21 MHz for
Band 20, which has an exceptional arrangement for its 25 PRB uplink
allocation.
Using L~ANT-RX~ = 5 dB, NF~RFIC~ = 4 dB, \|_c\|_ ^2^ = 10, ACLR~RX~ (dBc)
according to Table 8.3.1.1-1 and a 25 PRB UL allocation with a minimum SNR = 1
dB including implementation margin, we obtain _P_ ~REFSENS~ = -96.9 dBm for
the 10 MHz bandwidth for the diversity-only and the 2 UL MIMO architectures.
For the 20 MHz channel we obtain _P_ ~REFSENS~ = -90.5 dBm for both
architectures assuming _P_ ~TX~ = +27 dBm for the diversity-only architecture.
For the 3 MHz bandwidth, the IP2 performance may motivate a relaxation since
the TX isolation may be limited, standard values are more challenging in the
switched architecture with overlapping bands, and the RX IL is higher as
discussed in Section 8.2.1.1.
The proposed reference sensitivity is shown in Table 8.3.1.1-2 and Table
8.3.1.1-3 that includes selected other bands for comparison (Band 3 with
duplex spacing of 95 MHz with 50 PRB allocation and Band 4 with a very large
spacing and full uplink allocation).

For the smaller bandwidth, the isolation at TX is important. Tables 8.1.1-1
and 8.1.1-2 indicate that the attenuation at TX is less than the 52 dB
commonly assumed and leakage through switches may have to be considered for
the overlapping DPX1 and DPX2 ranges, which should be considered for IIP2
performance.
#### 8.3.1.2 In-band blocking
For the in-band blocking requirements, we observe from Figure 5.1-1 that both
Band 26 and the lower E850 TX bands fall within the in-band blocking range for
APT700, which could merit additional in-band blocking cases for APT700 to
reduce the risk of blocking. Figure 8.3.1.2-1 shows a typical duplexer
response for DPX2 at room temperature.
{width="2.842361111111111in" height="2.1958333333333333in"}{width="2.8625in"
height="2.2118055555555554in"}
Figure 8.3.1.2-1: a typical duplexer response for DPX2 in the receive range
(provisional data).
For a Band 26 aggressor, we observe that the upper filter DPX2 would provide a
20 dB rejection above 814 MHz, which indicates (only one example filter
implementation) that no additional in-band blocking case is needed for
protection from Band 26 blockers.
For a lower E850 aggressor, the rejection is very limited, the worst blocking
case is a 1.4 MHz carrier allocated down to 806 MHz: the filter in Figure
8.3.1.2-1 would only provide rejection above 808 MHz (10 dB at room
temperature). The rejection would not be much better than that provided by the
adjacent channel selectivity (ACS). For many deployments, e.g. in Region 2,
there are narrowband (25 kHz) blockers down to 806 MHz for which there is no
rejection. One possibility is to specify a tighter requirement (higher blocker
level) for the in-band blocking Case 1 for which a 5 MHz interferer is
assigned at 808-813 MHz for the larger bandwidths; the DPX2 would then provide
limited rejection. The standard blocking level for this case is -56 dBm.
However, narrowband 25 kHz or 1.4 MHz E-UTRA carriers down to 806 MHz is still
the worst case.
Another way for improving blocking performance is to limit the E-UTRA channel
bandwidths allocated at the upper edge of the APT700 band. However, for
wideband interferers like E-UTRA lower E850 carriers, the OOB emission is the
dominant interferer source in most cases. It is therefore more important to
specify a relevant unwanted emission level for lower E850 aggressors rather
than restricting the APT700 bandwidth for the fewer cases where blocking is
the liming case.
Hence specification of additional in-band blocking cases or bandwidth
restrictions to reduce impact for lower E850 blockers would be of limited
value: there is no duplexer rejection of a 1.4 MHz E-UTRA blocker down to 806
MHz. Blockers above 810 MHz (including temperature variation) would be
attenuated by the DPX2 filter for the filter implementation shown in Figure
8.3.1.2-1.
### 8.3.2 TDD
#### 8.3.2.1 REFSENS
The APT700 TDD band may be the victim of in-band blocking signals below 694
MHz (DTV) in the proximity of the passband. In order to allow implementations
with band-stop (notch) filters in the RX front-end at the expense of RX IL,
the baseline reference sensitivity of Band 33 should be modified. Provisional
filter data suggests a 2 dB relaxation of the baseline Band 33 reference
sensitivity, see Section 8.3.2.2. The resulting REFSENS requirement is shown
in Table 8.3.2.1-1.

#### 8.3.2.2 In-band blocking
The closest interferer to be considered for in-band blocking (in addition to
E-UTRA APT700 TDD) is DTV below 694/698 MHz that also falls inside the in-band
blocking range. Band 26/XXVI and Band 27 also fall within this range, but are
not considered for deployment in China.
Just as for FDD, any additional in-band blocking cases are not introduced.
However, the specification should allow implementations with filters to
suppress DTV blockers, which would imply a relaxation of the RX IL at the
upper edge.
For blocking by DTV signals, notch filters may be used, which would have an
impact on RX IL at lower edge and allow a relaxation to accommodate an
increased insertion loss. It could be possible to rely on standard in-band
blocking requirements for DTV below 694 MHz, which corresponds to a -44 dBm
level as displayed in Figure 8.3.2.2-1, but recognizing that the received DTV
power may well exceed this level in some deployment scenarios (see Section
7.3.1).
Figure 8.3.2.2-1: blocking by DTV and relation to the standard in-band
requirements.
Even if the standard in-band blocking test is used, the specification should
allow implementations with filter to suppress these blockers, which would
imply a relaxation of the RX IL at the lower edge. This may also imply an IL
penalty in the TX path if a bidirectional TX/RX filter is used.
Figure 8.3.2.2-2 shows provisional results of a band-stop filter suppressing
the highest DTV channel below 694 MHz with the filter traces displayed at room
temperature. Significant rejection can be achieved but there is no room for
temperature variation. The RX IL penalty at the upper band edge (803 MHz) is
2.5 dB.

Figure 8.3.2.2-2: provisional trace of band-stop filter for the highest DTV
channel below 694 MHz.
In general, provisional simulations from one filter vendor suggests that,
using band-stop (notch) filters,
\- rejection of DTV channels below 698 MHz (5 MHz separation) is not feasible
at a reasonable RX IL penalty,
\- rejection of DTV channels below 694 MHz (9 MHz separation) is feasible,
For the case of DTV below 694 MHz (the most common upper limit for DTV), the
estimated specified RX IL is of the order of 4 dB at 30 dB rejection.
The estimation of the RX IL is based on the assumption that the filter is
designed for one of the interference cases above; if multiple cases need
consideration the IL increase and stop-band rejection may not be achieved.
Therefore, this suggests that no additional in-band blocking case be specified
but that a relaxation of the reference sensitivity is considered to make room
for additional IL in the RX path if a band-stop filter is implemented for one
particular blocking scenario. Anticipating further optimization, a relaxation
of the reference sensitivity of 2 dB may be relevant.
## 8.4 BS Transmitter Requirements
### 8.4.1 Unwanted emissions for TDD
The service below the band is assumed to be TV. Above the band there are
uplinks of trunking systems. Since the regulatory situation is not clear, it's
proposed not to define special requirements at this moment. These regional
regulatory requirements could be introduced in the future when the situation
is clear.
## 8.5 BS Receiver Requirements
### 8.5.1 Blocking
The service adjacent to the low end of the band is TV. The BS specifications
differentiate between the frequencies more than 20 MHz outside of the band and
the region less than 20 MHz outside or inside the band. The requirements in
the specifications are -15 dBm CW carrier and -43 dBm wideband interferer for
6 dB noise rise. Considering that 1) it is mainly the uppermost TV channel and
3 MHz of the second uppermost channel that lie inside the "inside" region and
2) that there are few BS sites that will be located close to TV transmitters
using the two uppermost channels, there is no need for special blocking
requirements at the low end of the band. Since TV transmitters that use the
uppermost channels are relatively rare any remaining problems can be solved
using site solutions.
At the upper end of the band the adjacent bands have uplinks. Since the in-
band blocking requirements are derived considering uplinks also there is no
need to define special blocking requirements above the band.
The blocking requirements for collocation with other BS in TS 36.104 only
takes into account other 3GPP bands and thus other technologies above the band
should not be considered.
