# 4 Objectives of the Downlink MIMO Enhancement Study {#objectives-of-the-
downlink-mimo-enhancement-study .list-paragraph}
The objectives of this study are described in [2].
# 5 Identified scenarios {#identified-scenarios .list-paragraph}
Relevant scenarios and antenna configurations for the issues from real-life
MIMO deployments include:
  * Geographically separated antennas
  * Power-imbalanced antenna ports
  * Cross-polarized antenna deployments
For CSI feedback enhancements, the following scenarios (A, B, C) were agreed
to be studied with high priority, in the following order:
Priority 1: Scenarios A and C
Priority 2: Scenario B
Details of Scenarios A, B and C are given in Annex A.
A. Macro cell: Cross-polarized Macro-sites (2Tx, 4Tx)\ o Closely or widely
spaced
B. Outdoor and/or indoor low-power RRHs, with coordination with the macro
o High power RRH + low power RRHs
C. Outdoor small cell(s) with localized antennas\ o Cross polarized/Co-
polarized (mainly 4Tx)\ o Uncorrelated (less correlated)\ o Low mobility
The motivations for this prioritization are that single point transmission
should be the focus of this study, and coordination aspects have a lower
priority.
The following scenarios are also identified for study with lower priority than
scenarios A, B, C:
  * Indoor low power node with localized antennas
  * Active antennas with vertical beamforming
  * Feedback for partial reciprocity
  * Homogeneous macro network with 8 cross-polarized antennas (closely or widely-spaced)
  * Indoor and/or outdoor low power RRHs without coordination with the macro but with coordination between the low-power RRHs.
# 6 Issues from Real-Life MIMO Deployments {#issues-from-real-life-mimo-
deployments .list-paragraph}
The following issues are identified as high-priority:
  * Time misalignment / antenna calibration
  * Downlink control signalling enhancement (including UE-specific RS-based)
  * Feedback and related enhancements, including:
    * Interference measurement enhancement
    * Rank reporting
    * CSI accuracy (especially for MU-MIMO) for the high-priority scenarios and antenna configurations.
## 6.1 Time misalignment / antenna calibration {#time-misalignment-antenna-
calibration .list-paragraph}
The performance impact of time misalignment and calibration error has been
studied with the summary as follows,
  * Time misalignment and calibration error handling is implementation dependent
  * Time misalignment and calibration error has less system performance impact for SU-MIMO than for MU-MIMO
  * Time misalignment and calibration error does not have significant system performance impact at least for co-located antennas, especially for SU-MIMO
  * Sub-band PMI/CQI feedback is more beneficial in the presence of TAE than without TAE
  * Any further evaluations on feedback enhancement should take TAE into account -- discuss further how/when to model TAE.
## 6.2 Downlink Control Signalling Enhancements {#downlink-control-signalling-
enhancements .list-paragraph}
Downlink control signalling enhancements are discussed in Section 8.
## 6.3 Feedback Enhancements {#feedback-enhancements .list-paragraph}
### 6.3.1 Rank Reporting {#rank-reporting .list-paragraph}
The accuracy of UE rank reporting was considered in the scenario of
geographically separated antennas in a cell, where the received power from
different CRS-ports of the cell has a large imbalance. This may for example
arise when antenna ports are comprised of interleaved antennas, as shown in
Figure 6.3.1-1 [4]. Scenario B (see Section 5) is considered to provide
appropriate assumptions for evaluating such deployments.
{width="3.7979166666666666in" height="2.0416666666666665in"}
Figure 6.3.1-1: Geographically separated antenna deployment with interleaved
antenna ports
In such a deployment, when a UE is close to one antenna the signal strength
from the corresponding antenna port is very good, while the other port is much
weaker. In between the antenna locations, a good spatial multiplexing gain
should be achieved, while close to an antenna the performance should be close
to that of single antenna transmission. Overall, the system performance should
in theory be significantly improved compared to a SIMO deployment with the
same number of antennas.
However, in some measurements it was observed that the throughput became very
low close to the antennas while UEs with apparently SINR-based rank estimation
still reported RI=2. The rank estimation algorithm of some UEs apparently has
problems handling a large power difference between two antenna ports. On the
other hand, other UEs were found to have no problems in such scenarios [5].
It is noted that UE implementations should not assume geographical co-location
for different antenna ports of a given cell, or in general dependence among
antenna ports. The Layer 1 specifications assume that there is flexibility
with respect to mapping different antenna ports of a cell to different
geographically separated antennas. In particular, geographical co-location may
not be assumed for, e.g., antenna ports transmitting cell-specific reference
signals (CRS), UE-specific reference signals (DM-RS), and CSI reference
signals (CSI-RS). Precoding relies on the independence of different antenna
ports, over possibly geographically separated antennas, with the mapping from
antenna ports to antennas being transparent to the UE. It is concluded that
any problems with this issue should be handled by the development of
appropriate performance requirements [6].
### 6.3.2 Interference Measurement {#interference-measurement .list-paragraph}
Interference measurement enhancements for CoMP are handled in the Work Item on
Coordinated Multi-Point Operation for LTE [3].
### 6.3.3 CSI Accuracy {#csi-accuracy .list-paragraph}
CSI Accuracy enhancements are discussed in Section 7.
# 7 CSI Feedback Enhancements {#csi-feedback-enhancements .list-paragraph}
The performance of any feedback scheme is the same in CoMP scenario 3 and CoMP
scenario 4 assuming Rel-11 allows the necessary specification support.
Therefore, it is not needed to run separate simulations for scenarios 3 and 4
for feedback performance evaluation. Simulation assumptions for the evaluation
of potential enhancements to CSI feedback are given in Annex A.1.
The main enhancements considered are:
  * Enhanced PMI feedback codebook for 4-tx, including cross-polarised antennas, possibly two-stage W~1~.W~2~ structure adopted for the 8-tx codebook in Rel-10, and/or finer codeword granularity in the codebook, and/or capturing the amplitude offset between polarisations.
  * Finer frequency-domain sub-band granularity for CSI feedback, for example in conjunction with a new CSI feedback mode including sub-band CQI and sub-band PMI.
  * CQI or CQI related feedback specifically for MU-MIMO
  * Rank-restriction or PMI selection
  * PMI that causes least interference to the reporting UE
With various of the above enhancements, alone or in combination, the results
are summarized below.
## 7.1 Evaluation Results {#evaluation-results .list-paragraph}
Different schemes have been simulated. The baseline results are based on
Rel-10 specifications. The proposed enhancement schemes being simulated used
different quantization rate. Different feedback overheads are assumed. Some
enhancement schemes used idealized technique, such as SVD. Some simulation
results used idealized assumptions, such as ideal channel estimation,
feedbacks, and receivers. Some results are simulated with all UEs outdoors.
Evaluation results were provided by 14 companies [9]

high priority during this study and may be considered in the future.
# 8 Downlink Control Signalling Enhancements {#downlink-control-signalling-
enhancements-1 .list-paragraph}
The motivations for introducing an enhanced PDCCH (ePDCCH) were considered
[7]. It was noted that an ePDCCH is relevant not only to downlink MIMO
enhancement (in particular MU-MIMO), but also to a new carrier type being
developed under the Work Item "Carrier Aggregation Enhancements for LTE" [8]
and to the Work Item "Coordinated Multi-Point Operation for LTE" [3]. Based on
considerations from these three aspects, it is concluded that any new ePDCCH
should be:
\- able to support increased control channel capacity
\- able to support frequency-domain ICIC,
\- able to achieve improved spatial reuse of control channel resource
\- able to support beamforming and/or diversity
\- able to operate on the new carrier type and in MBSFN subframes
\- able to coexist on the same carrier as legacy UEs
Additional desirable characteristics include the ability to be scheduled
frequency-selectively, and the ability to mitigate inter-cell interference.
Simulation assumptions for the evaluation of an ePDCCH are given in Annex A.2.
# 9 Specification Impacts {#specification-impacts .list-paragraph}
For rank reporting, the potential specification impacts identified relate to
the UE performance requirements.
For CSI feedback enhancements, the potential specification impacts for the
considered techniques include:
\- A new PMI feedback codebook for 4-tx
\- PUSCH feedback mode additions
\- PUCCH feedback mode schemes and formats.
\- Signalling to configure CSI feedback, including codebooks, rank
restriction, etc
\- Feedback of multiple PMIs/CQIs/CSIs, which include multiple PMIs/single
CQI, multiple PMIs/multiple CQIs, single PMIs/multiple CQIs.
\- New additional CQI definition and new additional methodology to specify the
UE performance requirements.
\- New additional PMI definition and new additional methodology to specify the
UE performance requirements.
For downlink control channel enhancements, the potential specification impacts
include the definition of a new physical channel with corresponding coding,
search space design, reference signals and physical resource mapping. New
demodulation performance requirements would also be required.
# 10 Conclusions {#conclusions .list-paragraph}
According to the discussions and performance evaluation results captured in
the previous sections, the following conclusions are drawn:
  * Identified real-life issues with UE rank reporting in non-colocated > antenna deployments should be handled by the development of > appropriate performance requirements.
  * According to the summary of all simulation results, CSI feedback > enhancements for 4 transmit antennas may offer some performance > benefits for antenna configurations, such as cross-polarized > antennas, both closely- and widely-spaced. Potential CSI feedback > enhancements proposed by at least one company are as follows
    * 4-tx PMI feedback codebook enhancements
    * a new CSI feedback mode including sub-band CQI and sub-band PMI
    * finer spatial-domain and frequency-domain granularity
    * signalling to support codebook enhancement .
    * Additional CQI/PMI feedbacks to support MU-MIMO
    * Combinations of above
  * The need of enhancements for downlink control signalling - Capacity, > Frequency domain ICIC, Beamforming gain and Spatial reuse of > control channels have been the most supported motivations for the > decision to introduce an enhanced physical downlink control > channel in Rel. 11
```{=html}
``` \- MIMO enhancement provides further motivation for introducing a new >
physical downlink control channel, which is also relevant for > carrier
aggregation enhancement and CoMP.
In view of these observations, it is recommended at least to specify
appropriate performance requirements to ensure the accuracy of UE rank
reporting in non-collocated antenna deployments and to continue with
specifying a new downlink physical control channel. An agreement on whether to
specify CSI feedback enhancements has not been reached.
