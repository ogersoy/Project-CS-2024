# 5 Identification of Coverage Issues {#identification-of-coverage-issues
.list-paragraph}
## 5.1 Scope, Methodology, and Assumptions {#scope-methodology-and-assumptions
.list-paragraph}
### 5.1.1 Scope of the study {#scope-of-the-study .list-paragraph}
The following scope is defined for the identification of coverage issues, by
taking coverage imbalance into account [3].
  * First priority is identifying the limiting channel(s)/direction between the various LTE data and control channels in UL and DL.
    * The following services are considered: VoIP, medium data rate.
```{=html}
``` \- The following other aspects can be studied with second priority:
    -   Identifying the MCL of the minimum UL data rate for LTE;
    -   Assessing the coverage of UMTS Rel-99 channels for comparison
        reference (especially for CS voice).
  * Once the limiting channels are identified, study the possibility to enhance their coverage
    * Ideal enhancement target is to bring the limiting channels to a > similar coverage as other channels.
### 5.1.2 Evaluation Methodology {#evaluation-methodology .list-paragraph}
The identification of coverage issues uses the MCL (Maximum Coupling Loss)
methodology, defined as follows.
The coupling loss is defined as the total long-term channel loss over the link
between the UE antenna ports and the eNodeB antenna ports, and includes in
practice antenna gains, path loss, shadowing, body loss, etc. The maximum
coupling loss (MCL) is the limit value of the coupling loss at which the
service can be delivered, and therefore defines the coverage of the service.
The MCL is independent of the carrier frequency. It is defined in the UL and
DL as:
  * UL MCL = UL Max Tx power - eNB Sensitivity
  * DL MCL = DL Max Tx power - UE Sensitivity
The MCL is evaluated via link budget analysis (supported by link level
simulations). The proposed MCL calculation template is given in following
table:
Table 5-1: MCL calculation template
+---------------------------------------+-----------+ | **Physical channel name** | **Value** | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | **Transmitter** | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | **(1) Tx power (dBm)** | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | **Receiver** | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | (2) Thermal noise density (dBm/Hz) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | (3) Receiver noise figure (dB) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | (4) Interference margin (dB) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | (5) Occupied channel bandwidth (Hz) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | (6) Effective noise power | | | | | | = (2) + (3) + (4) + 10 log(5) (dBm) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | (7) Required SINR (dB) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | **(8)** **Receiver sensitivity** | | | | | | = (6) + (7) (dBm) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+ | **(9)** **MCL** | | | | | | = (1) âˆ’ (8) (dB) | | +---------------------------------------+-----------+
The Rel-8/9/10 features should be considered for coverage issues
identification. The impact of the features, such as HARQ, PUSCH hopping, TTI
bundling, Beamforming, etc. is to be evaluated with link level simulations and
included in the required SINR for the respective channel.
Solutions currently investigated in Rel-11 should not be part of the study on
identification of imbalances or coverage issues, but could be considered as
part of the potential solutions.
### 5.1.3 Evaluation Assumptions {#evaluation-assumptions .list-paragraph}
The evaluation assumptions for the identification of coverage issues are
captured in the tables below.

Note that for voice service comparison, the same band for LTE/LTE-A and UMTS
is assumed.
For the value of interference margin, 0dB is mandatory. Additional value is
left to the companies to decide and should be indicated when presenting the
results.
#### 5.1.3.2 Channel-specific parameters
Results for equal power distribution on REs are mandatory.
Unequal power distribution between channels or between RS and channels can be
applied; the power configuration is left to the companies to decide and should
be indicated when presenting the results.
The following acronyms are used in this section:
  * Pmiss: Probability of missed detection;
  * Pfa: Probability of false alarm;
  * TBI: "To Be Indicated", which means the related parameter is not specified but each company has to indicate its value when presenting the results;
  * TBS: Transport Block Size;
  * rBLER: residual BLER after retransmission;
  * iBLER: initial BLER.

## 5.3 Conclusion on Further Investigations {#conclusion-on-further-
investigations .list-paragraph}
  * Further investigate coverage enhancements for medium data rate and VoIP in UL with first priority, and for Msg3 with second priority.
  * Further investigate coverage enhancements for DL control channel(s). And this part is proposed to be processed in "Enhanced downlink control channel(s) for LTE" WI.
  * Further enhancements for other channels are FFS.
# 6 Solutions for Coverage Enhancements {#solutions-for-coverage-enhancements
.list-paragraph}
TTI bundling is specified as follows in Release 8/9/10 to improve UL coverage:
  * A single transport block is channel coded and transmitted in a set of 4 consecutive TTIs.
  * The bundled TTIs are treated as a single UL resource assignment where a single UL grant and a single PHICH ACK/NACK are required.
  * TTI bundling is activated through RRC.
  * HARQ RTT and HARQ process of TTI bundling are specified.
In the Release 8/9/10 specifications, the TTI bundling mechanism is restricted
to bundles of 4 TTIs, QPSK modulation and to allocations up to 3 PRBs. For
VoIP, these constraints leave some room to further improve the amount of
energy transmitted per information bit, and thus the coverage. Higher data
rate services can potentially benefit from reduced overhead and larger coding
gain resulting from larger transport block sizes associated with TTI bundling.
These constraints impose restrictions on the support of large packet sizes,
thus limiting the benefit for data services.
It is agreed to further investigate TTI bundling enhancements for both medium
data rate and VoIP in UL. The following potential enhancements have been
identified:
## 6.1 TTI bundling enhancements for medium data rate PUSCH {#tti-bundling-
enhancements-for-medium-data-rate-pusch .list-paragraph}
### 6.1.1 Description {#description .list-paragraph}
The TTI bundling enhancements should target for exploiting the coding gain,
improving the diversity, reducing the overhead and so on. Candidate solutions
are as follows:
  * Allowing more than 3 PRBs allocated per subframe
Larger transport block size can be supported in TTI bundling case when more
PRBs are allocated. This brings benefits including more channel coding gain,
more flexibility of resource allocations, and so on.
Other solutions for further study are as follows:
  * Enhanced method to get larger TBS from the TBS table.
  * Enhanced hopping, taking into account of channel estimation accuracy.
  * Support for bundling with higher order modulation.
### 6.1.2 Coverage gain {#coverage-gain .list-paragraph}
For performance evaluation, Rel-8 PUSCH 384 kbps without TTI bundling or with
TTI bundling (limited to 3PRB) is the reference. Here, the simulation
assumptions listed in Table 5-2 and Table 5-4. Note that PUSCH frequency
hopping is turned on in most companies' simulations in this configuration. The
performance metrics can include:
  * The required SNR values to achieve 10% iBLER with fixed MCS > configuration
  * The required SNR values to achieve effective rate of 384 kbps with > the setting of multiple HARQ transmissions and adaptive MCS > selection targeting for 10% iBLER
In Table 6-1, coverage gains in terms of required SNRs are listed.

Note: Differences to the results are observed due to implementation
differences and large difference in simulation assumptions.
* New frequency pattern is assumed for TTI enhancements.
** Include link adaptation optimization and frequency diversity gains.
*** The _N~PRB~_ *_N~TTI\ ~_ is used for TBS table lookup.
It can be observed from the results in Table 6-1 that a coverage gain in the
order of 1 dB can be expected..
### 6.1.3 Expected impact on the network {#expected-impact-on-the-network
.list-paragraph}
Different handling between legacy and supporting Ues needs to be implemented
in the eNodeB.
The following additional impacts on network could be expected:
  * Increase the flexibility of resource allocations
  * Reduce the control overhead
### 6.1.4 Specification impact {#specification-impact .list-paragraph}
  * Introducing a new TTI bundling mode or new TTI bundling behaviour
  * The specification of this new TTI bundling mode or behaviour may > include at least the following item:
    * allocating more than 3 PRBs per subframe
## 6.2 TTI bundling enhancements for UL VoIP {#tti-bundling-enhancements-for-
ul-voip .list-paragraph}
### 6.2.1 Description {#description-1 .list-paragraph}
Given the fixed arrival rate of voice packets, TTI bundling enhancements for
VoIP can improve the time resource utilization so that more energy can be
accumulated for a voice packet within the delay budget. Candidate solutions
are as follows:
  * Reduced round trip time
> Reduced round trip time can bring benefits for more energy accumulation for
> VoIP within given delay budget.
  * Extended bundle size
> Another candidate to accumulate more energy for VoIP within given delay
> budget is to extend the bundle size. The bundle size could be fixed or
> flexible.
  * Enhanced method to increase the time diversity
> Bundled TTIs can be interleaved in time, so that PUSCH transmission spans
> over longer time.
  * Addition of spreading
> TTI bundling with retransmissions involves repeating the coded bits. An
> alternative way of achieving repetition is to use spreading, which has the
> additional benefit of increasing the robustness with respect to
> interference. A similar structure as PUCCH format 3 could be used in order
> to add the spreading dimension.
It is for further study to extend TTI bundling to more TDD DL/UL
configurations.
TTI bundling enhancements may take into account of improvement of diversity
and channel estimation accuracy.
### 6.2.2 Coverage gain {#coverage-gain-1 .list-paragraph}
Rel-8 VoIP TTI bundling is considered as the baseline, with the frequency
hopping turned on. The performance is measured by the required Es/Nt for 2%
residual BLER within around 50 ms delay budget. Results from all available
sources indicate that around 1 dB gain can be achieved when overall 20 ms
transmission time is utilized.

It is observed that the coverage gain can be achieved by dynamic scheduling
[16] with higher PDCCH overhead compared to semi-static scheduling.
Applicability of dynamic scheduling in all mobility scenarios may not be
guaranteed, due to potential limits in measurements accuracy.
### 6.2.3 Expected impact on the network {#expected-impact-on-the-network-1
.list-paragraph}
The following impacts on network could be expected:
  * Reduced round trip time may have impact on scheduler implementations > and/or signalling mechanism needing to handle multiple different > RTTs for different users. It may result in less efficient resource > utilization or higher control overhead. The resources used with > less efficiency, if any, would be restricted to the PRBs allocated > to the VoIP users close to the coverage limit, which are typically > assigned a low number of PRBs (e.g. 1 or 3).
```{=html}
``` \- Extended bundle size may reduce the flexibility in resource >
allocation.
  * Addition of spreading may require new receiver algorithms, channel > and interference estimation. It may also require additional > network planning and coordination.
### 6.2.4 Specification impact {#specification-impact-1 .list-paragraph}
