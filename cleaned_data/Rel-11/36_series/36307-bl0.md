Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies requirements for Rel-11UEs supporting release
independent features like:
\- additional E-UTRA operating frequency bands on top of Rel-11 of TS 36.101
[2] and TS 36.133 [3];
\- additional E-UTRA CA configurations (intra-band/inter-band) on top of
Rel-11 of TS 36.101 [2] and TS 36.133 [3];
\- additional operating bands and/or CA configurations for specific features;
\- other release independent features (like 4Rx antenna port).

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**release independent** : applicable to some frozen releases, starting from a
certain release Rel-M
NOTE 1: Normally, a feature is introduced only in the latest open release
Rel-N and future releases are based on the previous one so that future
releases inherit the requirements of this feature. Introducing a feature \"in
a release independent way from Rel-M onwards\" (M\ 64, | | | | | Power Class 3 | | | | +-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Operating | FDD, TDD | Rel-10 | Table B.2.1-1, | | bands, NS-value | | | Table B.4.1-1 | | > 32 | | | | +-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Asymmetric | FDD | Rel-10 | Table B.2.1-1, | | operating | | | Table B.4.1-1 | | bands, Power | | | | | Class 3 | | | | +-----------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Operating | FDD | Rel-10 | Table B.2.1-1, | | bands, band | | | Table B.4.1-1 | | number \ \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-9 | | | > and below: clause 4.3 | | | > (Minimization of Drive Tests). | | | | | | NOTE 2: All requirements and the | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except: | | | | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-8: | | | > clauses 6.3 (RRC Connection | | | > Release with Redirection), 6.4 | | | > (CSG Proximity Indication for | | | > E-UTRAN and UTRAN). | | | | | | NOTE 3: All requirements and | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except those defined in | | | sections 7.4 and 7.5. | | | | | | NOTE 4: All requirements and | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except: | | | | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-8: | | | > clauses 8.1.2.5 (E-UTRAN OTDOA | | | > Intra-Frequency RSTD | | | > Measurements), 8.1.2.6 | | | > (E-UTRAN Inter-Frequency OTDOA | | | > Measurements), 8.1.2.7 | | | > (E-UTRAN E-CID Measurements). | | | | | | NOTE 5: All requirements and | | | corresponding test cases shall | | | apply, except: | | | | | | > \- for supporting the | | | > corresponding band in Rel-8: | | | > clauses 9.1.9 (UE Rx--Tx time | | | > difference), 9.1.10 (Reference | | | > Signal Time Difference). | | | | | | NOTE 6: All requirements and | | | test cases in this table shall | | | apply, except those defined for: | | | carrier aggregation; | | | measurements under time-domain | | | measurement resource restriction | | | with or without CRS assistance | | | information, in addition to the | | | exceptions listed above. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
