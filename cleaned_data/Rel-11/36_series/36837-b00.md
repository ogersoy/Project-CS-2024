HPUE High Power User Equipment
# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
The FCC Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau mandates LTE technology for
the 700 MHz Public Safety band (3GPP Band 14). Currently there is only one
power class defined for EUTRAN UE, i.e. power class 3 (+23dBm) for Band 14.
This limitation on UL power is a bottleneck to enable higher achievable data
rate with broader coverage, which are essential for Public Safety Broadband
(PSBB) systems to provide the necessary population coverage and UL throughput
requirements for Public Safety and US Homeland Security.
Band 14 PSBB will need to provide better coverage and availability/throughput
performance than provided by commercial systems particularly in rural areas.
This can be achieved by using higher power UE(s) for vehicular mobile
applications by allowing "first responders" to send and receive video and
data, thus providing the ability to co-ordinate response and protect lives in
these scenarios.
LTE commercial rollout is normally planned with availability of up to 95% of
the United States population. Using United States census data we find that 95%
of the total population (307 million) resides in 1.26 million square miles or
36% of the land area of US (3.5 million square miles). However for PSBB we
need to provide a > 95% populations coverage area. We find that 99% of the
total resides in 2.03 million square miles or 58% of the land area of US. That
means that we have to provide rural coverage for 0 .77 (2.03 -- 1.26) million
square miles with these higher power vehicular mobiles.
Since Band 14 LTE high-power UE OOBE into Band 13 LTE BS Rx band could be
higher than a Power class 3 UE, it is recommended that Band 14 and Band 13 co-
existence studies be performed to assess the throughput/OOB emission impact
for the new B14 higher power class
A B14 Higher Power UE (HPUE) would have different RF specification
requirements than the normal power Class 3 UE; therefore it is proposed to
specify these additional (more stringent) requirements in terms of a new Band
14 power class (Power Class 1) in 3GPP TS36.101 [2] for PSBB deployment as
part of a new RAN WID.
## 4.2 Objective
The objective is to write the RF core requirements that are applicable to Band
14 High Power UE for Region 2
1\. The new requirements will only cover the transmission and reception
requirements, but no baseband demodulation performance requirements for;
a. Band 14
b. E-UTRA UE Power Class 1 (+33dBm target)
c. Public Safety broadband (PSBB) deployment
2\. The following specification work is required
a. Core RF requirements for RAN4 E-UTRA specifications for FDD Band 14
3\. The work item should take into account the co-existence and compatibility
of LTE systems deployed in the 700MHz band
4\. The work item does not preclude additional co-existence scenarios.
5\. Maintain the same co-existence impact in terms of throughput/OOB emissions
from the B14 HPUE to B13 through tighter requirements for the HPUE where
applicable
# 5 Deployment and co-existence studies

studies for the Band 14 higher power class for Region 2
## 5.2 Upper 700MHz band
The Upper 700 MHz band includes the following spectrum blocks:
**C Block:** 746 MHz -- 757 MHz: Down-link (Node B transmit, UE receive)
776 MHz - 787 MHz: Up-link (UE transmit, Node B receive)
**A Block:** 757 MHz -- 758 MHz: Down-link (Node B transmit, UE receive)
787 MHz - 788 MHz: Up-link (UE transmit, Node B receive)
**D Block:** 758 MHz -- 763 MHz: Down-link (Node B transmit, UE receive)
788 MHz -- 793 MHz: Up-link (UE transmit, Node B receive)
**F Block:** 763 MHz -- 768 MHz: Down-link (Node B transmit, UE receive)
793 MHz - 798 MHz: Up-link (UE transmit, Node B receive)
In 3GPP the Upper 700MHz band spectrum block are specified in terms of two
operating bands. B13 and B14 as shown in Table 5.2.1 for UE Power Class 3 (+23
dBm ±2dB) in [2]

The above requirements are summarized below in Figure 5.3.2-1. The
requirements highlighted in red indicate the -35dBm/6.25KHz requirements for
the protection of PSNB. The block coloured in black indicates where the
requirements are not specified in the case of B14_D block. Additionally this
Figure 5.3.2-1 shows the unnecessary -35dBm/6.25KHz emission requirements from
C block (B13) to B14_F Block.

Figure 5.3.2-1: FCC emission limits for Upper 700MHz
In 3GPP TS36.101 [2] the following approach was specified to address these
missing and unnecessary requirements;
\- Since for B14_D block the emission requirements for 763-768MHz and
793-799MHz are not specified, a -13dBm/100KHz requirement was used in line
with requirements for other UL scenarios in this and other operating bands.
\- Currently C block is required to provide a -35dBm/6.25KHz protection limit
from 763-775MHz and 793-805MHz (PSBB and PSNB spectrum), while a B14_D and
B14_F block MS is only needed to protect a sub-set which is 768-775MHz and
799- 805 MHz (PSNB spectrum only). Therefore C block requirements are now
aligned to be consistent with B14 i.e. protection limit of -35dBm/6.25KHz is
specified only for PSNB (768-775MHz and 799- 805 MHz PSNB spectrum only)
With the recent allocation of D block to PSBB this now seems a reasonable
assumption and would be in line with 3GPP TS36.101 emission requirement as
shown below in Figure 5.3.2-2.

### 5.3.3 Protection of GPS
In order to protect operations in the 1559-1610MHz band from interference for
the Upper 700MHz D and F Block
**27.53 Emission limits.**
a) For operations in the 746--763 MHz, 775--793 MHz, and 805--806 MHz bands,
emissions in the band 1559--1610 MHz shall be limited to −70 dBW/MHz
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for wideband signals, and −80
dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth. For the purpose
of equipment authorization, a transmitter shall be tested with an antenna that
is representative of the type that will be used with the equipment in normal
operation.
**90.543 Broadband transmitting power limits.**
a) For operations in the 763--775 MHz and 793--805 MHz bands, all emissions
including harmonics in the band 1559--1610 MHz shall be limited to -70 dBW/MHz
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for wideband signals, and -80
dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth. For the purpose
of equipment authorization, a transmitter shall be tested with an antenna that
is representative of the type that will be used with the equipment in normal
operation.
## 5.4 Co-existence and compatibility of LTE systems deployed in the 700MHz
band
### 5.4.1 Simulation assumptions
The simulation methodology and assumptions are mainly based on TS36.942 [11]
with slight modifications.
#### 5.4.1.1 Macro cell Propagation model - Rural Area
The HPUE will be mainly used for extending the coverage in rural areas. The
following Hata rural model [2] is used,
L (R)= 69.55 +26.16log~10~(f)--13.82log~10~(Hb)+[44.9-6.55log~10~(Hb)]log(R)
-- 4.78(log~10~ (f))^2^+18.33 log~10~ (f) -40.94
where:
R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres
f is the carrier frequency in MHz
Hb is the base station antenna height above ground in metres
For carrier frequency of 790MHz and base station antenna height of 45m above
the ground, the propagation model becomes:
$L = \text{94}\text{.}5 + \text{34log}_{\text{10}}(R)$ (1)
Also per 36.942[11], in rural area, Macro cell MCL is 80dB as show in the
table below.
Table 5.4.1.1-1 3GPP TS36.942 [11] Minimal Coupling Loss
* * *
Environment Scenario MCL Macro cell Urban Area BS ↔ UE 70 dB Macro cell Rural
Area BS ↔ UE 80 dB
* * *
#### 5.4.1.2 Power control modelling
In [11], the following power control equation is used for the uplink
coexistence simulations:
where _P_ ~max~ is the maximum transmit power, _R_ ~min~ is the minimum power
reduction ratio to prevent UEs with good channels to transmit at very low
power level, _CL_ is the coupling loss defined as max{path loss-G_Tx-G_Rx,
MCL}, where path loss is propagation loss plus shadowfading, G_TX is the
transmitter antenna gain in the direction of the receiver, G_RX is the
receiver antenna gain in the direction of the transmitter and _CL~x-~_ ~ile~
is the _x_ -percentile _CL_ value. With this power control equation, the _x_
percent of UEs that have the highest coupling loss will transmit at _P_ ~max~.

### 6.2.4 UE maximum output power with additional requirements
Additional spectrum emission requirements can be signalled by the network to
indicate that the UE shall also meet additional requirements in a specific
deployment scenario. To meet these additional requirements, Additional Maximum
Power Reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the output power as specified in Table
6.2.2-1. Unless stated otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.
Currently NS_06 is signalled for B14 in order to meet the FCC Part 27
requirements pertaining to D block. Since D block has been recently allocated
to PSBB by US Congress it may be necessary to review if NS_06 should be
mandatory signalled by the network to UE since PSBB would be expected to be
covered by the Part 90 requirements for both B14 Power Class 1 and Power Class
3.
It is proposed to maintain the existing requirements for both Power Class 1
and Power Class 3 when NS_06 is signalled with an A-MPR of 0 dB
### 6.2.5 Configured transmitted power
The tolerances applicable to the measured configured maximum output power
P~UMAX~ should be extended to accommodate the target transmit power of +31dBm
referred to in subclause 6.2.3. Currently Table 6.2.5-1 [2] has an upper bound
of +23dBm.
An additional row should be added into Table 6.2.5-1 as this gives the option
for setting a different tolerance on the measured configured maximum output
power for high power UEs, if so desired.
The number included in the proposed amendment should be enclosed within
brackets for the following reasons:
▪ This can be used as a working assumption to until the conclusion of the co-
existence work
▪ This can be used as a working assumption to progress the core RF
requirements

##### 6.6.2.3.2 Minimum requirements UTRA
UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (UTRA~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned E-UTRA channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent(s) UTRA channel frequency.
The ACLR requirements for UTRA were specified as a general requirement for LTE
devices to address operators for deployment next to UTRA FDD and TDD networks.
This is indicated as by the note 1 and note 2 in Table 6.6.2.3.2-2.
NOTE 1: Applicable for E-UTRA FDD co-existence with UTRA FDD in paired
spectrum.
NOTE 2: Applicable for E-UTRA TDD co-existence with UTRA TDD in unpaired
spectrum.
Since B14 is only adjacent to B13 E-UTRA (LTE) (this requirements seems
unnecessary for a B14 Power Class 1 and Power Class 3 terminal and therefore
should not be part of the RAN5 conformance test requirements for B14.
Proposal that this UTRA~ACLR1/2~ requirements is specified as a new table in
TS36.101 for Power Class 1 and this tighter requirement shall be applicable

### 6.6.3 Spurious emissions
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions
unless otherwise stated. The spurious emission limits are specified in terms
of general requirements in line with ITU \--R SM.329 and E-UTRA operating band
requirement to address UE co-existence.
#### 6.6.3.1 Minimum requirements
For B14, the spurious emission limits apply for the frequency ranges that are
more than Δf~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.6.3.1-1 from the edge of the channel
bandwidth. The spurious emission limits in Table 6.6.3.1-2 below
Table 6.6.3.1-2: Spurious emissions limits
* * *
Frequency Range Maximum Level Measurement bandwidth Note 9 kHz ≤ f \< 150 kHz
-36 dBm 1 kHz  
150 kHz ≤ f \< 30 MHz -36 dBm 10 kHz  
30 MHz ≤ f \< 1000 MHz -36 dBm 100 kHz  
1 GHz ≤ f \< 12.75 GHz -30 dBm 1 MHz
* * *
This is applicable for all transmitter band configurations (N~RB~) for the
supported B14 channel bandwidth
Table 6.6.3.1-1: Boundary between E-UTRA Δf~OOB~ and spurious emission domain
+-------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ | Channel bandwidth | 1.4 | 3.0 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | | | | | | | | | | | MHz | MHz | MHz | MHz | MHz | MHz | +-------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ | Δf~OOB~ (MHz) | n/s | n/s | 10 | 15 | n/s | n/s | +-------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
If the same requirements are applicable for the HPUE, this results in an
increase in required performance for frequency ranges greater than 10/15 MHz
from the edge of the channel bandwidth due to the higher transmit Proposal to
set HPUE Power Class 1 to be the same as Power Class 3 which represents a
tighter requirements for a Power Class 1 device.
#### 6.6.3.2 Spurious emission band UE co-existence
This clause specifies the requirements for the specified E-UTRA band, for
coexistence with protected bands. The applicable requirements for a B14 Power
Class 3 devices is as follows

If the same requirements are applicable for the HPUE, this results in a
tighter implementation requirement for a Power Class 1 terminal compared to a
Power Class 3 terminal due to the higher transmit power.
Proposal to set HPUE Power Class 1 to be the same as Power Class 3 which
represents a tighter requirements for a Power Class 1 device
## 6.7 Transmit intermodulation
The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna
If the same requirements are applicable for the HPUE, this results an increase
in required implementation performance due to the higher transmit power.
Proposal: to set HPUE Power Class 1 to be the same as Power Class 3 which
represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device
# 7 B14 HPUE receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
The LTE specification for HPUE Class 1 (vehicular mobile form factor) is
expected to follow the general methodology in 3GPP TS36.101 for a Class 3
(handheld form factor) as closely as possible except where variations are
warranted.
{width="5.846527777777778in" height="3.0236111111111112in"}
Figure 7.1-1 B14 RF architecture IC and RF IC for Power Class 1 and 3
The alignment of implementation assumptions for the RF combining front end
would be similar to the methodology and components as used for the LTE base
station.
The reason for this difference is a conventional miniature Class 3 SAW handset
duplexer filter cannot be used for the HPUE as they will not support the
higher power rating/linearity or achieve the necessary filter attenuation and
isolation between Tx and Rx ports due to the increase in Tx power from +23dBm
to +31 dBm for a class 1 vehicular terminal.
{width="5.227777777777778in" height="1.9902777777777778in"}
Figure 7-2; Typical duplex filter for Power Class 1 (Ceramic) and Power Class
3 (SAW)
For the receiver, the key parameter that is affected by the increase in Tx
power is RFSENS due to the possible increase in Tx noise at the receive
frequency due to the higher transmit power. Receiver performance can also be
affected due to a higher Tx leakage signal which can impact the blocking
performance unless additional Tx- Rx filter isolation or high power LNA is
provided. It should also be noted that the normal goals of a class 3 device,
in terms of size, weight and battery, are not key driver for vehicular
deployment.
## 7.2 Diversity characteristics
The requirements for Power Class 3 assume that the receiver is equipped with
two Rx ports as a baseline. These requirements apply to all UE categories
unless stated otherwise. Requirements for 4 ports are FFS. With the exception
of subclause 7.9 all requirements shall be verified by using both (all)
antenna ports simultaneously.
Proposal; the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class
3
## 7.3 Reference sensitivity power level
The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to both the UE antenna ports at which the throughput shall meet or
exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel.
For Power Class 1, the same methodology will be used as Power Class 3 i.e. the
transmitter will be set to P~UMAX~ +31dBm, with the UL resource blocks shall
be located as close as possible to the downlink operating band. For the HPUE,
this would result in a less implementation since Tx noise leakage into the Rx
chain is expected to increase due to the high transmit power unless mitigated
by addition TX --RX isolation in the RF combining network
Proposal: the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class
3 which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for P~UMAX~ defined as a side condition
## 7.4 Maximum input level
This is defined as the maximum mean power received at the UE antenna port, at
which the specified relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements for the specified reference measurement channel.
Requirements for Power Class 1 will be the same as Power Class 3 however, in
the case of Power Class 3 the performance will need to be met at 4dB below
PCMAX_L which is +26dBm for Power Class 1
Proposal the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class 3
which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for PCMAX_L defined as a side condition
## 7.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to
receive a E-UTRA signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre
frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter
attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter
attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
Requirements for Power Class 1 will be the same as Power Class 3 however in
the case of Power Class 3 the performance will need to be met at 4dB below
PCMAX_L which is +26 dBm for Power Class 1
Proposal the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class 3
which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for PCMAX_L defined as a side condition.
## 7.6 Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response
or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a
degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit. The
blocking performance shall apply at all frequencies except those at which a
spurious response occur.
### 7.6.1 In-band blocking
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into
the UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive
band at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirement for the specified measurement channels..
Requirements for Power Class 1 will be the same as Power Class 3 however in
the case of Power Class 3 the performance will need to be met at 4dB below
PCMAX_L which is +26 dBm for Power Class 1
Proposal the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class 3
which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for PCMAX_L defined as a side condition
### 7.6.2 Out-of-band blocking
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal
falling more than 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band. For the first 15
MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or
adjacent channel selectivity in subclause 7.5.1 and subclause 7.6.1 shall be
applied.
Requirements for Power Class 1 will be the same as Power Class 3 however in
the case of Power Class 3 the performance will need to be met at 4dB below
PCMAX_L which is [+28] dBm for Power Class 1
Proposal the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class 3
which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for PCMAX_L defined as a side condition
### 7.6.3 Narrow band blocking
This requirement is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive a E-UTRA
signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an unwanted narrow
band CW interferer at a frequency, which is less than the nominal channel
spacing.
Requirements for Power Class 1 will be the same as Power Class 3 however, in
the case of Power Class 3 the performance will need to be met at 4dB below
PCMAX_L which is [+28] dBm for Power Class 1
Proposal the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class 3
which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for PCMAX_L defined as a side condition
## 7.7 Spurious response
Spurious response is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive a wanted
signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a given degradation
due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at any other
frequency at which a response is obtained i.e. for which the out of band
blocking limit as specified in subclause 7.6.2 is not met.
Proposal the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class 3
which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for PCMAX_L defined as a side condition
## 7.8 Intermodulation characteristics
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific frequency
relationship to the wanted signal
### 7.8.1 Wide band intermodulation
The wide band intermodulation requirement is defined following the same
principles using modulated E-UTRA carrier and CW signal as interferer.
Proposal the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class 3
which represents a tighter requirement for a Power Class 1 device due to the
higher value required for PCMAX_L defined as a side condition
## 7.9 Spurious emissions
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the UE antenna connector.
Proposal: the requirement for Power Class 1 should be the same as Power Class
3
## 7.10 Receiver image
# 8 Other specification impacts (if applicable)
## 8.1 Impacts on RAN1 specifications
The impact of the change of power class is checked for procedure involving UE
transmit power:
● uplink power control
● power headroom reporting
Power setting for PUSCH and power headroom reporting are defined in section
5.1.1 of TS 36.213 [6].
Power setting for PUCCH and SRS are defined respectively in section 5.1.2 and
5.1.3 of TS 36.213 [6].
Power levels for the various uplink signals are computed by the UE from higher
layer parameters, current transmission configuration (number of RBs, carrier
aggregation with/without simultaneous PUSCH/PUCCH transmission) and power
control commands. P~CMAX,C~ is used as the limit the computed value shall not
exceed.
Changing the power class will impact the value of P~CMAX,C~. However, it has
no impact on the principle and the formula of the uplink power control defined
in TS 36.213 [6].
In a similar manner, P~CMAX,C~ is used as the reference for computing the
power headroom but the change of the power class has not impact on the section
5.1.1.2 of TS 36.213 [6]
## 8.2 Impacts on signalling
### 8.2.1 Signalling of the maximum output power of the UE
The following is an extract of the TS 36.331 [7] specification:
P-Max
The IE _P-Max_ is used to limit the UE\'s uplink transmission power on a
carrier frequency and is used to calculate the parameter _Pcompensation_
defined in TS 36.304 [10]. Corresponds to parameter P~EMAX~ or P~EMAX,c~ in TS
36.101 [2]. The UE transmit power on one serving cell shall not exceed the
configured maximum UE output power of the serving cell determined by this
value as specified in TS 36.101 [2 clause 6.2.5 or 6.2.5A].
**_P-Max_ information element**
\-- ASN1START
P-Max ::= INTEGER (-30..33)
\-- ASN1STOP
p-Max is used by the UE to compute the limits of its configured power
P~CMAX~:(p-Max is equal to P~EMAX~ is the equations below):
\- P~CMAX_L~ = MIN { P~EMAX~ -- T~C~, P~PowerClass~ -- MAX(MPR + A-MPR,
P-MPR) -- T~C~}
\- P~CMAX_H~ = MIN {P~EMAX~, P~PowerClass~}
In case this value is signalled by the eNodeB, the maximum output power of the
UE cannot be configured to a value higher than P-Max. The upper value of P-Max
has driven the choice for the target value of the new power class at 31dBm.
With the introduction of the extended power headroom report (see TS 36.321
[8], section 6.1.3.6a), the value of P~CMAX,C~ is reported. The mapping for
P~CMAX,C~ can be found in 3GPP TS36.133 [9] section 9.6.1.
Table 9.6.1-1 Mapping of P~CMAX,c~ , 3GPP TS36.133 [9]
* * *
Reported value Measured quantity value Unit PCMAX_C_00 P~CMAX,c~ \< -29 dBm
PCMAX_C_01 -29 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< -28 dBm PCMAX_C_02 -28 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< -27 dBm
... ... ... PCMAX_C_61 31 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< 32 dBm PCMAX_C_62 32 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \<
33 dBm PCMAX_C_63 33 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ dBm
* * *
The upper limit is also equal to +33dBm. However, this report is only
applicable in case of carrier aggregation and there is currently no carrier
aggregation configurations that include band 14.
### 8.2.2 Power Headroom reporting
The reporting range of the PHR is defined in 3GPP TS36.133 [9], section
9.1.8.4:
The power headroom reporting range is from -23 ...+40 dB. Table 9.1.8.4-1
defines the report mapping.
Table 9.1.8.4-1: Power headroom report mapping, 3GPP TS36.133 [9]
* * *
Reported value Measured quantity value (dB) POWER_HEADROOM_0 -23 ≤ PH \< -22
POWER_HEADROOM_1 -22 ≤ PH \< -21 POWER_HEADROOM_2 -21 ≤ PH \< -20
POWER_HEADROOM_3 -20 ≤ PH \< -19 POWER_HEADROOM_4 -19 ≤ PH \< -18
POWER_HEADROOM_5 -18 ≤ PH \< -17 ... ... POWER_HEADROOM_57 34 ≤ PH \< 35
POWER_HEADROOM_58 35 ≤ PH \< 36 POWER_HEADROOM_59 36 ≤ PH \< 37
POWER_HEADROOM_60 37 ≤ PH \< 38 POWER_HEADROOM_61 38 ≤ PH \< 39
POWER_HEADROOM_62 39 ≤ PH \< 40 POWER_HEADROOM_63 PH ≥ 40
* * *
The main purpose of the PHR is to assist the BS scheduler in the selection of
the MCS and the number of RBs so that the terminal is not power limited. Since
the reference of the power headroom is P~CMAX~ which is directly linked with
the power class of the UE, there is no reason to extend the range of the PHR
with the introduction of a higher power class.
