# 4 Background
Band 7 is a major FDD LTE band which has been allocated in Region 1, and most
likely to be allocated in China. Some operators have been granted with more
than 20MHz bandwidth and have big interests to support carrier aggregation in
this band.
Building on the generic intra-band carrier aggregation work of Band 1, this
work item proposes to start the work on intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation for Band 7 to support deployment of LTE-advanced.
The output of this work item can also be reused, in case of Band 7 is
authorized for FDD LTE deployment in other regions in the future.
## 4.1 Task description
This WI is to specify the band specific core and performance requirements for
intra-band carrier aggregation in band 7:
1) Specifying the core requirements for BS and UE in RAN4 specifications, and
taking the coexistence with adjacent Band 38 into account.
2) Specify band specific RRM requirements in RAN4 if any.
3) Signalling support in RAN2 specifications if any.
4) Performance requirements for BS and UE in RAN4 specifications.
## 4.2 Spectrum and regulatory review
This Work Item [2] is based on the spectrum arrangement as shown in Table
4.2-1[6].
Table 4.2-1 Frequency arrangements in the band 2 500-2 690 MHz
* * *
Frequency arrangement Mobile station transmitter\ Centre gap\ Base station
transmitter\ Duplex separation\ Centre gap usage (MHz) (MHz) (MHz) (MHz)
C1 2 500-2 570 50 2 620-2 690 120 TDD
* * *
The frequency band 2500-2570 MHz is paired with 2620-2690 MHz for FDD
operation with the mobile terminals transmit within the lower band and base
stations transmit within the upper band. This paired spectrum blocks are
designated as Band 7 [7] in 3GPP E-UTRA specifications. The frequency band
2570-2620 MHz is for TDD operation and is designated as Band 38 [8].
Band 7 is a major FDD band which has been allocated in region 1. Some
operators have been granted with more than 20MHz bandwidth.

### 6.1.2 UE minimum output power
Section 6.3.2A in TS 36.101 specifies the UE minimum output power requirements
for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation. In LTE_CA_B7 WI, it is proposed
to reuse the result in Table 6.3.2A.1-1 in TS 36.101 and the minimum output
power is defined as the mean power in one sub-frame (1ms).
20 MHz and 15 MHz component carrier channel bandwidths are proposed to be
supported in Band 7 carrier aggregation. The minimum output power shall not
exceed the values specified in Table 6.1.2-1.

### 6.1.3 UE Transmit OFF power
Section 6.3.3A in TS 36.101 specifies the UE Transmit OFF power requirements
for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation. In LTE_CA_B7 WI, it is proposed
to reuse the result in Table 6.3.3A.1-1 in TS 36.101 and transmit OFF power is
defined as the mean power in a duration of at least one sub-frame (1ms)
excluding any transient periods.
20 MHz and 15 MHz component carrier channel bandwidths are proposed to be
supported in Band 7 carrier aggregation. UE transmit OFF power shall not
exceed the values specified in Table 6.1.3-1

## 6.2 Receiver characteristics
### 6.2.1 UE Reference sensitivity
From the section 7.3.1A in TS36.101, it is known that the reference
sensitivity for CA is defined to be met with both downlink component carrier
active and each component carrier shall meet the requirements specified in
clause 7.3.1.To avoid the effect from the uplink signal, the noise at PA
output which is generated by UL allocation should be small enough to reduce
the interference on DL signal when testing REFSENS, so the UL allocation for
CA should be restricted as shown in table 7.3.1A-1 in TS36.101.
In order to establish the UL allocation for CA band 7, the way how to
establish the UL allocation for CA band 1 is recalled in the following figure
6.2.1-1.
Figure 6.2.1-1 UL allocation for CA band 1 in TS36.101 when testing REFSENS
From above figure 6.2.1-1, it can be seen that the UL allocation should be
restricted to 130 RBs when testing REFSENS for CA band 1. It means when UL
allocation is 130 RB, the influence of UL signal on DL signal is so small that
can be ignored when testing REFSENS, no matter 100 RB+100 RB or 75 RB+75 RB
combinations. For band 7, the UL/DL spacing is 120 MHz according to TS 36.101,
which is smaller than 190 MHz for band 1. When testing REFSENS in TS36.101 R8,
the UL allocation is also restricted to be 75 RB rather than 100 RB for 20
MHz. So, for CA operation, it is preferred to keep the UL allocation 75 RB for
reducing the interference on DL signal. In order to compare with CA band1, the
following figure 6.2.1-2 is also given for CA band 7.
Figure 6.2.1-2 UL allocation for CA band 1 in TS 36.101 when testing REFSENS
Base on above analysis, it is proposed that the uplink configuration for CA
band 7 when testing REFSENS is shown in table 6.2.1-1.
In addition, in order to avoid the confusion of UL allocation in PCC and SCC,
the Note 4 is added in the following table 6.2.1-1.

### 6.2.2 In-band blocking
Section 7.6.1.1A in TS 36.101 specifies the in-band blocking requirements for
CA operation. There are no special blocking requirements for Band 7 relative
to the other bands, so no changes need to be made to the existing requirements
for CA operation.
All that required is to modify Table 7.6.1.1-2 to indicate that the same
requirements that applied to Band 1 and Band 40 CA are also applied to Band 7
CA, as shown below.
Table 6.2.2-1: In-band blocking

### 6.2.3 Out-of-band blocking
Section 7.6.2.1A in TS 36.101 specifies the out-of-band blocking requirements
for CA. There are no special blocking requirements for Band 7 relative to the
other bands, so no changes need to be made to the existing requirements for
CA.
All that required is to modify Table 7.6.2.1-2 in TS 36.101 to indicate that
the same requirements that applied to Band 1 and Band 40 CA are also applied
to Band 7 CA, as shown below.

### 6.3.2 A-MPR for multi-cluster transmission
A simulation campaign was performed and details were added into Annex A2.
Based on this study, the proposed backoff mask for CA_7C coexistence with band
38 is shown in Figure 6.3.2-1.

The proposed mask that shown in Figure 6.3.-1 can be formally written as
follows
A-MPR = CEIL {M~A,~ 0.5}
Where M~A~ is defined as follows
> M~A~ = [-23.33A + 17.5 ; 0 ≤ A \

# 7 E-UTRA RRM requirements for UE
A study of the existing technical specifications was conducted. The study
concluded that no change to UE RRM specifications is required.
# 8 E-UTRA RF requirements for BS
## 8.1 Transmitter characteristics
CA_7 could refer to use the requirements of BS Transmitter characteristics in
current TS36.104.
## 8.2 Receiver characteristics
CA_7 could refer to use the requirements of BS Receiver characteristics in
current TS36.104.
# 9 E-UTRA demodulation performance for BS and UE
A study of the UE and BS demodulation performance requirements in section 8 of
TS 36.101 and TS 36.104 was conducted. Since the demodulation performance
requirements in both specifications are band agnostic, and there is no
specific UE and BS demodulation performance required for Band 7 CA, it is
concluded that there is no change to the demodulation performance needed for
supporting Band 7 CA.

###### ### Annex A: A-MPR simulation
# A.1 A-MPR for contiguous transmission
## A.1.1 Simulation campaign
In these simulations emissions from band 7 to band 38 were studied and
sufficient backoff was searched to reach emission limits. Simulations were
performed with 100+100 RB and 75+75 RB configurations and they were placed in
the worst case position at the upped edge of band 7. Uplink centre frequency
was 2550.1 MHz for 100+100 RB configuration and 2555 MHz for 75+75 RB
configuration.
Emission limits for band 38 frequencies were as follows.

The following ACLR limits were used.
\- UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dB
\- UTRA~ACLR2~ = 36 dB
\- CA E-UTRA~ACRL~ = 30 dB
Spurious emissions limit was -30 dBm with 1MHz measurement bandwidth.
Simulation assumptions were as follows:
\- PA operating point: with fully allocated REL-8 100RB QPSK signal
UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc with Pout = 22 dBm.
\- Modulator IQ -- image = 25 dB
\- Modulator carrier leakage = 25 dBc
\- Modulator C_IM3 = 60 dBc
When setting the PA operating point it was checked that all ACLR results were
within the limits.
Post PA loss of 4 dB was used but no additional attenuation from duplex filter
was assumed.
