# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
In this specification, (parts of) procedures and messages specified for the UE
equally apply to the RN for functionality necessary for the RN. There are also
(parts of) procedures and messages which are only applicable to the RN in its
communication with the E-UTRAN, in which case the specification denotes the RN
instead of the UE. Such RN‑specific aspects are not applicable to the UE.
This specification is organised as follows:
\- sub-clause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;
\- sub-clause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as
the services expected from lower layers;
\- sub-clause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;
\- clause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;
\- clause 6 specifies the RRC message in a mixed format (i.e. tabular & ASN.1
together);
\- clause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and constants)
and counters to be used by the UE;
\- clause 8 specifies the encoding of the RRC messages;
\- clause 9 specifies the specified and default radio configurations;
\- clause 10 specifies the RRC messages transferred across network nodes;
\- clause 11 specifies the UE capability related constraints and performance
requirements.
## 4.2 Architecture
### 4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is in RRC_CONNECTED when an RRC connection has been established. If this
is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE
state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
\- **RRC_IDLE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers.
\- UE controlled mobility;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors a Paging channel to detect incoming calls, system information
change, for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification, and for CMAS capable UEs,
CMAS notification;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
\- Acquires system information.
\- Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time
for logged measurement configured UEs.
\- **RRC_CONNECTED** :
\- Transfer of unicast data to/from UE.
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX.
\- For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the
PCell, for increased bandwidth;
\- Network controlled mobility, i.e. handover and cell change order with
optional network assistance (NACC) to GERAN;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors a Paging channel and/ or System Information Block Type 1 contents
to detect system information change, for ETWS capable UEs, ETWS notification,
and for CMAS capable UEs, CMAS notification;
\- Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to
determine if data is scheduled for it;
\- Provides channel quality and feedback information;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
\- Acquires system information.
The following figure not only provides an overview of the RRC states in
E-UTRA, but also illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRAN, UTRAN and
GERAN.
Figure 4.2.1-1: E-UTRA states and inter RAT mobility procedures, 3GPP
The following figure illustrates the mobility support between E-UTRAN,
CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD. The details of the CDMA2000 state models are
out of the scope of this specification.
Figure 4.2.1-2: Mobility procedures between E-UTRA and CDMA2000
The inter-RAT handover procedure(s) supports the case of signalling,
conversational services, non-conversational services and combinations of
these.
In addition to the state transitions shown in Figure 4.2.1-1 and Figure
4.2.1-2, there is support for connection release with redirection information
from E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED to GERAN, UTRAN and CDMA2000 (HRPD Idle/ 1xRTT
Dormant mode).
### 4.2.2 Signalling radio bearers
\"Signalling Radio Bearers\" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RB) that are
used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the
following three SRBs are defined:
\- SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
\- SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as
well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH
logical channel;
\- SRB2 is for RRC messages which include logged measurement information as
well as for NAS messages, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower-
priority than SRB1 and is always configured by E-UTRAN after security
activation.
In downlink piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e.
with joint success/ failure) procedure: bearer establishment/ modification/
release. In uplink NAS message piggybacking is used only for transferring the
initial NAS message during connection setup.
NOTE: The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC
messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1 and SRB2, including those
containing NAS or non-3GPP messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by
PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS
messages.
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
\- Broadcast of common control information;
\- Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a terminating call, for ETWS,
for CMAS;
\- Transfer of dedicated control information, i.e. information for one
specific UE.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers
In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower
layers:
\- PDCP: integrity protection and ciphering;
\- RLC: reliable and in-sequence transfer of information, without introducing
duplicates and with support for segmentation and concatenation.
Further details about the services provided by Packet Data Convergence
Protocol layer (e.g. integrity and ciphering) are provided in TS 36.323 [8].
The services provided by Radio Link Control layer (e.g. the RLC modes) are
specified in TS 36.322 [7]. Further details about the services provided by
Medium Access Control layer (e.g. the logical channels) are provided in TS
36.321 [6]. The services provided by physical layer (e.g. the transport
channels) are specified in TS 36.302 [3].
## 4.4 Functions
The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:
\- Broadcast of system information:
\- Including NAS common information;
\- Information applicable for UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. cell (re-)selection
parameters, neighbouring cell information and information (also) applicable
for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, e.g. common channel configuration information.
\- Including ETWS notification, CMAS notification;
\- RRC connection control:
\- Paging;
\- Establishment/ modification/ release of RRC connection, including e.g.
assignment/ modification of UE identity (C-RNTI), establishment/ modification/
release of SRB1 and SRB2, access class barring;
\- Initial security activation, i.e. initial configuration of AS integrity
protection (SRBs) and AS ciphering (SRBs, DRBs);
\- For RNs, configuration of AS integrity protection for DRBs;
\- RRC connection mobility including e.g. intra-frequency and inter-frequency
handover, associated security handling, i.e. key/ algorithm change,
specification of RRC context information transferred between network nodes;
\- Establishment/ modification/ release of RBs carrying user data (DRBs);
\- Radio configuration control including e.g. assignment/ modification of ARQ
configuration, HARQ configuration, DRX configuration;
\- For RNs, RN-specific radio configuration control for the radio interface
between RN and E-UTRAN;
\- In case of CA, cell management including e.g. change of PCell, addition/
modification/ release of SCell(s) and addition/modification/release of
STAG(s);
\- QoS control including assignment/ modification of semi-persistent
scheduling (SPS) configuration information for DL and UL, assignment/
modification of parameters for UL rate control in the UE, i.e. allocation of a
priority and a prioritised bit rate (PBR) for each RB;
\- Recovery from radio link failure;
\- Inter-RAT mobility including e.g. security activation, transfer of RRC
context information;
\- Measurement configuration and reporting:
\- Establishment/ modification/ release of measurements (e.g. intra-frequency,
inter-frequency and inter- RAT measurements);
\- Setup and release of measurement gaps;
\- Measurement reporting;
\- Other functions including e.g. transfer of dedicated NAS information and
non-3GPP dedicated information, transfer of UE radio access capability
information, support for E-UTRAN sharing (multiple PLMN identities);
\- Generic protocol error handling;
\- Support of self-configuration and self-optimisation;
\- Support of measurement logging and reporting for network performance
optimisation [60];
NOTE: Random access is specified entirely in the MAC including initial
transmission power estimation.
# 5 Procedures
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Introduction
The procedural requirements are structured according to the main functional
areas: system information (5.2), connection control (5.3), inter-RAT mobility
(5.4) and measurements (5.5). In addition sub-clause 5.6 covers other aspects
e.g. NAS dedicated information transfer, UE capability transfer, sub-clause
5.7 specifies the generic error handling, sub-clause 5.8 covers MBMS and sub-
clause 5.9 covers RN-specific procedures.
### 5.1.2 General requirements
The UE shall:
1> process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the
processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a
subsequent message;
NOTE 1: E-UTRAN may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the
UE\'s response of a previously initiated procedure.
1> within a sub-clause execute the steps according to the order specified in
the procedural description;
1> consider the term \'radio bearer\' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs but not MRBs
unless explicitly stated otherwise;
1> set the _rrc-TransactionIdentifier_ in the response message, if included,
to the same value as included in the message received from E-UTRAN that
triggered the response message;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _setup_ :
2> apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the
associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _release_ :
2> clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated
resources;
1> upon handover to E-UTRA; or
1> upon receiving an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the
_fullConfig_ :
2> apply the Conditions in the ASN.1 for inclusion of the fields for the
DRB/PDCP/RLC setup during the reconfiguration of the DRBs included in the
_drb-ToAddModList_ ;
NOTE 2: At each point in time, the UE keeps a single value for each field
except for during handover when the UE temporarily stores the previous
configuration so it can revert back upon handover failure. In other words:
when the UE reconfigures a field, the existing value is released except for
during handover.
NOTE 3: Although not explicitly stated, the UE initially considers all
functionality to be deactivated/ released until it is explicitly stated that
the functionality is setup/ activated. Correspondingly, the UE initially
considers lists to be empty e.g. the list of radio bearers, the list of
measurements.
## 5.2 System information
### 5.2.1 Introduction
#### 5.2.1.1 General
System information is divided into the _MasterInformationBlock_ (MIB) and a
number of _SystemInformationBlocks_ (SIBs). The MIB includes a limited number
of most essential and most frequently transmitted parameters that are needed
to acquire other information from the cell, and is transmitted on BCH. SIBs
other than _SystemInformationBlockType1_ are carried in _SystemInformation_
(SI) messages and mapping of SIBs to SI messages is flexibly configurable by
_schedulingInfoList_ included in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , with
restrictions that: each SIB is contained only in a single SI message, and at
most once in that message; only SIBs having the same scheduling requirement
(periodicity) can be mapped to the same SI message;
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ is always mapped to the SI message that
corresponds to the first entry in the list of SI messages in
_schedulingInfoList_. There may be multiple SI messages transmitted with the
same periodicity. _SystemInformationBlockType1_ and all SI messages are
transmitted on DL-SCH.
NOTE 1: The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take.
When DCI format 1C is used the maximum allowed by the physical layer is 1736
bits (217 bytes) while for format 1A the limit is 2216 bits (277 bytes), see
TS 36.212 [22] and TS 36.213 [23].
In addition to broadcasting, E-UTRAN may provide _SystemInformationBlockType1_
, including the same parameter values, via dedicated signalling i.e., within
an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message.
The UE applies the system information acquisition and change monitoring
procedures for the PCell. For an SCell, E-UTRAN provides, via dedicated
signalling, all system information relevant for operation in RRC_CONNECTED
when adding the SCell. Upon change of the relevant system information of a
configured SCell, E-UTRAN releases and subsequently adds the concerned SCell,
which may be done with a single _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message. If the
UE is receiving or interested to receive an MBMS service in a cell, the UE
shall apply the system information acquisition and change monitoring procedure
to acquire parameters relevant for MBMS operation and apply the parameters
acquired from system information only for MBMS operation for this cell.
NOTE 2: E-UTRAN may configure via dedicated signalling different parameter
values than the ones broadcast in the concerned SCell.
An RN configured with an RN subframe configuration does not need to apply the
system information acquisition and change monitoring procedures. Upon change
of any system information relevant to an RN, E-UTRAN provides the system
information blocks containing the relevant system information to an RN
configured with an RN subframe configuration via dedicated signalling using
the _RNReconfiguration_ message. For RNs configured with an RN subframe
configuration, the system information contained in this dedicated signalling
replaces any corresponding stored system information and takes precedence over
any corresponding system information acquired through the system information
acquisition procedure. The dedicated system information remains valid until
overridden.
NOTE 3: E-UTRAN may configure an RN, via dedicated signalling, with different
parameter values than the ones broadcast in the concerned cell.
#### 5.2.1.2 Scheduling
The MIB uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 40 ms and repetitions made
within 40 ms. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframe #0 of
radio frames for which the SFN mod 4 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in
subframe #0 of all other radio frames.
The _SystemInformationBlockType1_ uses a fixed schedule with a periodicity of
80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms. The first transmission of
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ is scheduled in subframe #5 of radio frames for
which the SFN mod 8 = 0, and repetitions are scheduled in subframe #5 of all
other radio frames for which SFN mod 2 = 0.
The SI messages are transmitted within periodically occurring time domain
windows (referred to as SI-windows) using dynamic scheduling. Each SI message
is associated with a SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do
not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI is
transmitted. The length of the SI-window is common for all SI messages, and is
configurable. Within the SI-window, the corresponding SI message can be
transmitted a number of times in any subframe other than MBSFN subframes,
uplink subframes in TDD, and subframe #5 of radio frames for which SFN mod 2 =
0. The UE acquires the detailed time-domain scheduling (and other information,
e.g. frequency-domain scheduling, used transport format) from decoding SI-RNTI
on PDCCH (see TS 36.321 [6]).
A single SI-RNTI is used to address _SystemInformationBlockType1_ as well as
all SI messages.
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ configures the SI-window length and the
transmission periodicity for the SI messages.
#### 5.2.1.3 System information validity and notification of changes
Change of system information (other than for ETWS, CMAS and EAB parameters)
only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification
period is used. System information may be transmitted a number of times with
the same content within a modification period, as defined by its scheduling.
The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod
_m_ = 0, where _m_ is the number of radio frames comprising the modification
period. The modification period is configured by system information.
When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first notifies
the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a modification
period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated
system information. These general principles are illustrated in figure
5.2.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different system information.
Upon receiving a change notification, the UE acquires the new system
information immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE
applies the previously acquired system information until the UE acquires the
new system information.
Figure 5.2.1.3-1: Change of system Information
The _Paging_ message is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED about a system information change. If the UE receives a _Paging_
message including the _systemInfoModification_ , it knows that the system
information will change at the next modification period boundary. Although the
UE may be informed about changes in system information, no further details are
provided e.g. regarding which system information will change.
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ includes a value tag, _systemInfoValueTag_ ,
that indicates if a change has occurred in the SI messages. UEs may use
_systemInfoValueTag_ , e.g. upon return from out of coverage, to verify if the
previously stored SI messages are still valid. Additionally, the UE considers
stored system information to be invalid after 3 hours from the moment it was
successfully confirmed as valid, unless specified otherwise.
E-UTRAN may not update _systemInfoValueTag_ upon change of some system
information e.g. ETWS information, CMAS information, regularly changing
parameters like time information (_SystemInformationBlockType8_ ,
_SystemInformationBlockType16_), EAB parameters. Similarly, E-UTRAN may not
include the _systemInfoModification_ within the _Paging_ message upon change
of some system information.
The UE verifies that stored system information remains valid by either
checking _systemInfoValueTag_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1 after the
modification period boundary, or_ attempting to find the
_systemInfoModification indication at least modificationPeriodCoeff times
during the modification period in case no paging is received, in every
modification period._ If no paging message is received by the UE during a
modification period, the UE may assume that no change of system information
will occur at the next modification period boundary. If UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
during a modification period, receives one paging message, it may deduce from
the presence/ absence of _systemInfoModification whether a change of system
information other than ETWS information, CMAS information and EAB parameters
will occur in the next modification period or not._
ETWS and/or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall attempt to read paging at
least once every _defaultPagingCycle_ to check whether ETWS and/or CMAS
notification is present or not.
#### 5.2.1.4 Indication of ETWS notification
ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification can occur at any
point in time. The _Paging_ message is used to inform ETWS capable UEs in
RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about presence of an ETWS primary
notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification. If the UE receives a
_Paging_ message including the _etws-Indication_ , it shall start receiving
the ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary notification according to
_schedulingInfoList_ contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_. If the UE
receives _Paging_ message including the _etws-Indication_ while it is
acquiring ETWS notification(s), the UE shall continue acquiring ETWS
notification(s) based on the previously acquired _schedulingInfoList_ until it
re-acquires _schedulingInfoList_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1_.
NOTE: The UE is not required to periodically check _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , but _Paging_ message including
the _etws-Indication_ triggers the UE to re-acquire _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ for scheduling changes for
_SystemInformationBlockType10_ and _SystemInformationBlockType11_. The UE may
or may not receive a _Paging_ message including the _etws-Indication_ and/or
_systemInfoModification_ when ETWS is no longer scheduled.
ETWS primary notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType10_ and
ETWS secondary notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType11_.
Segmentation can be applied for the delivery of a secondary notification. The
segmentation is fixed for transmission of a given secondary notification
within a cell (i.e. the same segment size for a given segment with the same
_messageIdentifier_ , _serialNumber_ and _warningMessageSegmentNumber_). An
ETWS secondary notification corresponds to a single _CB data_ IE as defined
according to **TS 23.041** [37].
#### 5.2.1.5 Indication of CMAS notification
CMAS notification can occur at any point in time. The _Paging_ message is used
to inform CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about presence
of one or more CMAS notifications. If the UE receives a _Paging_ message
including the _cmas-Indication_ , it shall start receiving the CMAS
notifications according to _schedulingInfoList_ contained in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_. If the UE receives _Paging_ message including
the _cmas-Indication_ while it is acquiring CMAS notification(s), the UE shall
continue acquiring CMAS notification(s) based on the previously acquired
_schedulingInfoList_ until it re-acquires _schedulingInfoList_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_.
NOTE: The UE is not required to periodically check _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , but _Paging_ message including
the _cmas-Indication_ triggers the UE to re-acquire _schedulingInfoList_
contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ for scheduling changes for
_SystemInformationBlockType12_. The UE may or may not receive a _Paging_
message including the _cmas-Indication_ and/or _systemInfoModification_ when
_SystemInformationBlockType12_ is no longer scheduled.
CMAS notification is contained in _SystemInformationBlockType12_. Segmentation
can be applied for the delivery of a CMAS notification. The segmentation is
fixed for transmission of a given CMAS notification within a cell (i.e. the
same segment size for a given segment with the same _messageIdentifier_ ,
_serialNumber_ and _warningMessageSegmentNumber_). E-UTRAN does not interleave
transmissions of CMAS notifications, i.e. all segments of a given CMAS
notification transmission are transmitted prior to those of another CMAS
notification. A CMAS notification corresponds to a single _CB data_ IE as
defined according to **TS 23.041** [37].
#### 5.2.1.6 Notification of EAB parameters change
Change of EAB parameters can occur at any point in time. The EAB parameters
are contained in _SystemInformationBlockType14_. The _Paging_ message is used
to inform EAB capable UEs in RRC_IDLE about a change of EAB parameters or that
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ is no longer scheduled. If the UE receives a
_Paging_ message including the _eab-ParamModification_ , it shall acquire
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ according to _schedulingInfoList_ contained in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_. If the UE receives a _Paging_ message including
the **_eab-ParamModification_** while it is acquiring
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ , the UE shall continue acquiring
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ based on the previously acquired
_schedulingInfoList_ until it re-acquires _schedulingInfoList_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_.
NOTE: The EAB capable UE is not expected to periodically check
_schedulingInfoList_ contained in _SystemInformationBlockType1_.
### 5.2.2 System information acquisition
#### 5.2.2.1 General
Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition, normal
The UE applies the system information acquisition procedure to acquire the AS-
and NAS- system information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure
applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.2.2.2 Initiation
The UE shall apply the system information acquisition procedure upon selecting
(e.g. upon power on) and upon re-selecting a cell, after handover completion,
after entering E-UTRA from another RAT, upon return from out of coverage, upon
receiving a notification that the system information has changed, upon
receiving an indication about the presence of an ETWS notification, upon
receiving an indication about the presence of a CMAS notification, upon
receiving a notification that the EAB parameters have changed, upon receiving
a request from CDMA2000 upper layers and upon exceeding the maximum validity
duration. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification,
the system information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored system
information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for system information
and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in system information
unless explicitly specified otherwise.
#### 5.2.2.3 System information required by the UE
The UE shall:
1> ensure having a valid version, as defined below, of (at least) the
following system information, also referred to as the \'required\' system
information:
2> if in RRC_IDLE:
3> the _MasterInformationBlock_ and _SystemInformationBlockType1_ as well as
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ through _SystemInformationBlockType8_ ,
depending on support of the concerned RATs;
2> if in RRC_CONNECTED:
3> the _MasterInformationBlock_ , _SystemInformationBlockType1_ and
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ as well as _SystemInformationBlockType8_ ,
depending on support of CDMA2000;
1> delete any stored system information after 3 hours from the moment it was
confirmed to be valid as defined in 5.2.1.3, unless specified otherwise;
1> consider any stored system information except
_SystemInformationBlockType10,_ _SystemInformationBlockType11,_
_systemInformationBlockType12_ and _systemInformationBlockType14_ to be
invalid if _systemInfoValueTag_ included in the _SystemInformationBlockType1_
is different from the one of the stored system information;
#### 5.2.2.4 System information acquisition by the UE
The UE shall:
1> apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;
1> if the procedure is triggered by a system information change notification:
2> start acquiring the required system information, as defined in 5.2.2.3,
from the beginning of the modification period following the one in which the
change notification was received;
NOTE 1: The UE continues using the previously received system information
until the new system information has been acquired.
1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE and enters a cell for which the UE does not have
stored a valid version of the system information required in RRC_IDLE, as
defined in 5.2.2.3:
2> acquire, using the system information acquisition procedure as defined in
5.2.3, the system information required in RRC_IDLE, as defined in 5.2.2.3;
1> following successful handover completion to a PCell for which the UE does
not have stored a valid version of the system information required in
RRC_CONNECTED, as defined in 5.2.2.3:
2> acquire, using the system information acquisition procedure as defined in
5.2.3, the system information required in RRC_CONNECTED, as defined in
5.2.2.3;
2> upon acquiring the concerned system information:
3> discard the corresponding radio resource configuration information included
in the _radioResourceConfigCommon_ previously received in a dedicated message,
if any;
1> following a request from CDMA2000 upper layers:
2> acquire _SystemInformationBlockType8_ , as defined in 5.2.3;
1> neither initiate the RRC connection establishment procedure nor initiate
transmission of the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message until the UE
has a valid version of the _MasterInformationBlock_ and
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ messages as well as
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ ;
1> not initiate the RRC connection establishment subject to EAB until the UE
has a valid version of _SystemInformationBlockType14_ , if broadcast;
1> if the UE is ETWS capable:
2> upon entering a cell during RRC_IDLE, following successful handover or upon
connection re-establishment:
3> discard any previously buffered _warningMessageSegment_ ;
3> clear, if any, the current values of _messageIdentifier_ and _serialNumber_
for _SystemInformationBlockType11_ ;
2> when the UE acquires _SystemInformationBlockType1_ following ETWS
indication, upon entering a cell during RRC_IDLE, following successful
handover or upon connection re-establishment:
3> if _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType10_ is
present:
4> start acquiring _SystemInformationBlockType10_ immediately;
3> if _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType11_ is
present:
4> start acquiring _SystemInformationBlockType11_ immediately;
NOTE 2: UEs shall start acquiring _SystemInformationBlockType10_ and
_SystemInformationBlockType11_ as described above even when
_systemInfoValueTag_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ has not changed.
1> if the UE is CMAS capable:
2> upon entering a cell during RRC_IDLE, following successful handover or upon
connection re-establishment:
3> discard any previously buffered _warningMessageSegment_ ;
3> clear, if any, stored values of _messageIdentifier_ and _serialNumber_ for
_SystemInformationBlockType12_ associated with the discarded
_warningMessageSegment_ ;
2> when the UE acquires _SystemInformationBlockType1_ following CMAS
indication, upon entering a cell during RRC_IDLE, following successful
handover and upon connection re-establishment:
3> if _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType12_ is
present:
4> acquire _SystemInformationBlockType12_ ;
NOTE 3: UEs shall start acquiring _SystemInformationBlockType12_ as described
above even when _systemInfoValueTag_ in _SystemInformationBlockType1_ has not
changed.
1> if the UE is interested to receive MBMS services:
2> if _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType13_ is
present and the UE does not have stored a valid version of this system
information block:
3> acquire _SystemInformationBlockType13_ ;
2> if the UE is capable of MBMS Service Continuity:
3> if _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType15_ is
present and the UE does not have stored a valid version of this system
information block:
4> acquire SystemInformationBlockType15;
1> if the UE is EAB capable:
2> when the UE does not have stored a valid version of
_SystemInformationBlockType14_ upon entering RRC_IDLE, or when the UE acquires
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ following EAB parameters change notification or
upon entering a cell during RRC_IDLE:
3> if _schedulingInfoList_ indicates that _SystemInformationBlockType14_ is
present:
4> start acquiring _SystemInformationBlockType14_ immediately;
3> else:
4> discard _SystemInformationBlockType14_ , if previously received;
NOTE 4: EAB capable UEs start acquiring _SystemInformationBlockType14_ as
described above even when _systemInfoValueTag_ in
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ has not changed.
NOTE 5: EAB capable UEs maintain an up to date _SystemInformationBlockType14_
in RRC_IDLE.
The UE may apply the received SIBs immediately, i.e. the UE does not need to
delay using a SIB until all SI messages have been received. The UE may delay
applying the received SIBs until completing lower layer procedures associated
with a received or a UE originated RRC message, e.g. an ongoing random access
procedure.
NOTE 6: While attempting to acquire a particular SIB, if the UE detects from
_schedulingInfoList_ that it is no longer present, the UE should stop trying
to acquire the particular SIB.
#### 5.2.2.5 Essential system information missing
The UE shall:
1> if in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2> if the UE is unable to acquire the _MasterInformationBlock_ or the
_SystemInformationBlockType1_ :
3> consider the cell as barred in accordance with TS 36.304 [4]; and
3> perform barring as if _intraFreqReselection_ is set to _allowed_ , and as

## 5.3 Connection control
### 5.3.1 Introduction
#### 5.3.1.1 RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. E-UTRAN
completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment
of the S1 connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from
the EPC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase
of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the
E-UTRAN may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only
sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful security
activation. However, the UE only accepts a handover message when security has
been activated.
NOTE: In case the serving frequency broadcasts multiple overlapping bands,
E-UTRAN can only configure measurements after having obtained the UE
capabilities, as the measurement configuration needs to be set according to
the band selected by the UE.
Upon receiving the UE context from the EPC, E-UTRAN activates security (both
ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial security activation
procedure. The RRC messages to activate security (command and successful
response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after
completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to
activate security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to
establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered.
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN
initiates the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. E-UTRAN may do this prior
to receiving the confirmation of the initial security activation from the UE.
In any case, E-UTRAN will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for
the RRC connection reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs.
E-UTRAN should release the RRC connection if the initial security activation
and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails (i.e. security activation and DRB
establishment are triggered by a joint S1-procedure, which does not support
partial success).
For SRB2 and DRBs, security is always activated from the start, i.e. the
E-UTRAN does not establish these bearers prior to activating security.
For some radio configuration fields, a critical extension has been defined. A
switch from the original version of the field to the critically extended
version is allowed using any connection reconfiguration. The UE reverts to the
original version of some critically extended fields upon handover and re-
establishment as specified elsewhere in this specification. Otherwise,
switching a field from the critically extended version to the original version
is only possible using the handover or re-establishment procedure with the
full configuration option.
After having initiated the initial security activation procedure, E-UTRAN may
configure a UE that supports CA, with one or more SCells in addition to the
PCell that was initially configured during connection establishment. The PCell
is used to provide the security inputs and upper layer system information
(i.e. the NAS mobility information e.g. TAI). SCells are used to provide
additional downlink and optionally uplink radio resources.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by E-UTRAN. The
procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an E-UTRA frequency or an inter-
RAT carrier frequency. Only in exceptional cases, as specified within this
specification, TS 36.300 [9], TS 36.304 [4] or TS 24.301 [35], may the UE
abort the RRC connection, i.e. move to RRC_IDLE without notifying E-UTRAN.
#### 5.3.1.2 Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection of RRC signalling (SRBs) as
well as the ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the security parameters which are part of the
AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm
and two parameters, namely the _keyChangeIndicator_ and the
_nextHopChainingCount,_ which are used by the UE to determine the AS security
keys upon handover and/ or connection re-establishment.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers SRB1
and SRB2. The ciphering algorithm is common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1,
SRB2 and DRBs). Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
RRC integrity and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one
message/ procedure. RRC integrity and ciphering are never de-activated.
However, it is possible to switch to a \'NULL\' ciphering algorithm (eea0).
The \'NULL\' integrity protection algorithm (eia0) is used only for the UE in
limited service mode [32, TS33.401]. In case the \'NULL\' integrity protection
algorithm is used, \'NULL\' ciphering algorithm is also used.
NOTE 1: Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity check has
failed and indicate the integrity verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies three different security keys: one for the integrity protection
of RRC signalling (K~RRCint~), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling
(K~RRCenc~) and one for the ciphering of user data (K~UPenc~). All three AS
keys are derived from the K~eNB~ key. The K~eNB~ is based on the K~ASME~ key,
which is handled by upper layers.
Upon connection establishment new AS keys are derived. No AS-parameters are
exchanged to serve as inputs for the derivation of the new AS keys at
connection establishment.
The integrity and ciphering of the RRC message used to perform handover is
based on the security configuration used prior to the handover and is
performed by the source eNB.
The integrity and ciphering algorithms can only be changed upon handover. The
four AS keys (K~eNB,~ K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~) change upon every
handover and connection re-establishment. The _keyChangeIndicator_ is used
upon handover and indicates whether the UE should use the keys associated with
the K~ASME~ key taken into use with the latest successful NAS SMC procedure.
The _nextHopChainingCount_ parameter is used upon handover and connection re-
establishment by the UE when deriving the new K~eNB~ that is used to generate
K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ (see TS 33.401 [32]). An intra cell handover
procedure may be used to change the keys in RRC_CONNECTED.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 36.323
[8]) is maintained for each direction. For each DRB, the COUNT is used as
input for ciphering. For each SRB, the COUNT is used as input for both
ciphering and integrity protection. It is not allowed to use the same COUNT
value more than once for a given security key. In order to limit the
signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence
number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 36.323 [8]). In addition, an overflow
counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as
specified in TS 36.323 [8]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE
and the eNB. The eNB is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the
same RB identity and with the same K~eNB~, e.g. due to the transfer of large
volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs. In order to avoid such
re-use, the eNB may e.g. use different RB identities for successive RB
establishments, trigger an intra cell handover or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE
to RRC_CONNECTED transition.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit
BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is
the value of the corresponding _srb-Identity_ with the MSBs padded with
zeroes.
#### 5.3.1.2a RN security
For RNs, AS security follows the procedures in 5.3.1.2. Furthermore, E-UTRAN
may configure per DRB whether or not integrity protection is used. The use of
integrity protection may be configured only upon DRB establishment and
reconfigured only upon handover or upon the first reconfiguration following
RRC connection re-establishment.
To provide integrity protection on DRBs between the RN and the E-UTRAN, the
K~UPint~ key is derived from the K~eNB~ key as described in TS33.401 [32]. The
same integrity protection algorithm used for SRBs also applies to the DRBs.
The K~UPint~ changes at every handover and RRC connection re-establishment and
is based on an updated K~eNB~ which is derived by taking into account the
_nextHopChainingCount._ The COUNT value maintained for DRB ciphering is also
used for integrity protection, if the integrity protection is configured for
the DRB.
#### 5.3.1.3 Connected mode mobility
In RRC_CONNECTED, the network controls UE mobility, i.e. the network decides
when the UE shall connect to which E-UTRA cell(s), or inter-RAT cell. For
network controlled mobility in RRC_CONNECTED, the PCell can be changed using
an _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message including the _mobilityControlInfo_
(handover), whereas the SCell(s) can be changed using the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message either with or without the
_mobilityControlInfo_. The network triggers the handover procedure e.g. based
on radio conditions, load. To facilitate this, the network may configure the
UE to perform measurement reporting (possibly including the configuration of
measurement gaps). The network may also initiate handover blindly, i.e.
without having received measurement reports from the UE.
Before sending the handover message to the UE, the source eNB prepares one or
more target cells. The source eNB selects the target PCell. The source eNB may
also provide the target eNB with a list of best cells on each frequency for
which measurement information is available, in order of decreasing RSRP. The
source eNB may also include available measurement information for the cells
provided in the list. The target eNB decides which SCells are configured for
use after handover, which may include cells other than the ones indicated by
the source eNB.
The target eNB generates the message used to perform the handover, i.e. the
message including the AS-configuration to be used in the target cell(s). The
source eNB transparently (i.e. does not alter values/ content) forwards the
handover message/ information received from the target to the UE. When
appropriate, the source eNB may initiate data forwarding for (a subset of) the
DRBs.
After receiving the handover message, the UE attempts to access the target
PCell at the first available RACH occasion according to Random Access resource
selection defined in TS 36.321 [6], i.e. the handover is asynchronous.
Consequently, when allocating a dedicated preamble for the random access in
the target PCell, E-UTRA shall ensure it is available from the first RACH
occasion the UE may use. Upon successful completion of the handover, the UE
sends a message used to confirm the handover.
If the target eNB does not support the release of RRC protocol which the
source eNB used to configure the UE, the target eNB may be unable to
comprehend the UE configuration provided by the source eNB. In this case, the
target eNB should use the full configuration option to reconfigure the UE for
Handover and Re-establishment. Full configuration option includes an
initialization of the radio configuration, which makes the procedure
independent of the configuration used in the source cell(s) with the exception
that the security algorithms are continued for the RRC re-establishment.
After the successful completion of handover, PDCP SDUs may be re-transmitted
in the target cell(s). This only applies for DRBs using RLC-AM mode and for
handovers not involving full configuration option. The further details are
specified in TS 36.323 [8]. After the successful completion of handover not
involving full configuration option, the SN and the HFN are reset except for
the DRBs using RLC-AM mode (for which both SN and HFN continue). For
reconfigurations involving the full configuration option, the PDCP entities
are newly established (SN and HFN do not continue) for all DRBs irrespective
of the RLC mode. The further details are specified in TS 36.323 [8].
One UE behaviour to be performed upon handover is specified, i.e. this is
regardless of the handover procedures used within the network (e.g. whether
the handover includes X2 or S1 signalling procedures).
The source eNB should, for some time, maintain a context to enable the UE to
return in case of handover failure. After having detected handover failure,
the UE attempts to resume the RRC connection either in the source PCell or in
another cell using the RRC re-establishment procedure. This connection
resumption succeeds only if the accessed cell is prepared, i.e. concerns a
cell of the source eNB or of another eNB towards which handover preparation
has been performed. The cell in which the re-establishment procedure succeeds
becomes the PCell while SCells and STAGs, if configured, are released.
Normal measurement and mobility procedures are used to support handover to
cells broadcasting a CSG identity. In addition, E-UTRAN may configure the UE
to report that it is entering or leaving the proximity of cell(s) included in
its CSG whitelist. Furthermore, E-UTRAN may request the UE to provide
additional information broadcast by the handover candidate cell e.g. global
cell identity, CSG identity, CSG membership status.
NOTE: E-UTRAN may use the \'proximity report\' to configure measurements as
well as to decide whether or not to request additional information broadcast
by the handover candidate cell. The additional information is used to verify
whether or not the UE is authorised to access the target PCell and may also be
needed to identify handover candidate cell (_PCI confusion_ i.e. when the
physical layer identity that is included in the measurement report does not
uniquely identify the cell).

The purpose of this procedure is:
\- to transmit paging information to a UE in RRC_IDLE and/ or;
\- to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about a system
information change and/ or;
\- to inform about an ETWS primary notification and/ or ETWS secondary
notification and/ or;

#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the _Paging_ message at
the UE\'s paging occasion as specified in TS 36.304 [4]. E-UTRAN may address
multiple UEs within a _Paging_ message by including one _PagingRecord_ for
each UE. E-UTRAN may also indicate a change of system information, and/ or
provide an ETWS notification or a CMAS notification in the _Paging_ message.
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of the _Paging_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _Paging_ message, the UE shall:

connection establishment involves SRB1 establishment. The procedure is also
used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/ message from the UE to
E-UTRAN.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to establish SRB1 only.

this value;
NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the S-TMSI if the UE is registered in the TA of
the current cell.
1> set the _establishmentCause_ in accordance with the information received
from upper layers;
The UE shall submit the _RRCConnectionRequest_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
The UE shall continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as cell
re-selection evaluation. If the conditions for cell re-selection are
fulfilled, the UE shall perform cell re-selection as specified in 5.3.3.5.
#### 5.3.3.4 Reception of the _RRCConnectionSetup_ by the UE

Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Security mode command, successful
Figure 5.3.4.1-2: Security mode command, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to activate AS security upon RRC connection
establishment.
#### 5.3.4.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the security mode command procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. Moreover, E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:

#### 5.3.5.1 General
Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC connection reconfiguration, successful
Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC connection reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to
establish/ modify/ release RBs, to perform handover, to setup/ modify/ release
measurements, to add/ modify/ release SCells. As part of the procedure, NAS
dedicated information may be transferred from E-UTRAN to the UE.
#### 5.3.5.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN may initiate the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- the _mobilityControlInfo_ is included only when AS-security has been
activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
\- the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC
connection establishment) is included only when AS security has been
activated;

configuration but not part of the _drb-ToAddModList:_
2> perform DRB release as specified in 5.3.10.2;
### 5.3.6 Counter check
#### 5.3.6.1 General
Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by E-UTRAN to request the UE to verify the
amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is
requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT
match with the values indicated by E-UTRAN.
NOTE: The procedure enables E-UTRAN to detect packet insertion by an intruder
(a \'man in the middle\').
#### 5.3.6.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending a _CounterCheck_ message.
NOTE: E-UTRAN may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches
a specific value.
#### 5.3.6.3 Reception of the _CounterCheck_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _CounterCheck_ message, the UE shall:
1> for each DRB that is established:
2> if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is
a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3> assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2> if the _drb-Identity_ is not included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of the corresponding COUNT;
2> else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT
are different from the value indicated in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of the corresponding COUNT;
1> for each DRB that is included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ in the
_CounterCheck_ message that is not established:
2> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding
values in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ and the least significant bits set to
zero;
1> submit the _CounterCheckResponse_ message to lower layers for transmission
upon which the procedure ends;
### 5.3.7 RRC connection re-establishment
#### 5.3.7.1 General
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC connection re-establishment, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection, which
involves the resumption of SRB1 operation, the re-activation of security and
the configuration of only the PCell.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which security has been activated, may initiate the
procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-
establishment succeeds only if the concerned cell is prepared i.e. has a valid
UE context. In case E-UTRAN accepts the re-establishment, SRB1 operation
resumes while the operation of other radio bearers remains suspended. If AS
security has not been activated, the UE does not initiate the procedure but
instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to reconfigure SRB1 and to resume data transfer only for this RB;
\- to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms.
#### 5.3.7.2 Initiation
The UE shall only initiate the procedure when AS security has been activated.
The UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is met:
1> upon detecting radio link failure, in accordance with 5.3.11; or
1> upon handover failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.6; or
1> upon mobility from E-UTRA failure, in accordance with 5.4.3.5; or
1> upon integrity check failure indication from lower layers; or
1> upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with 5.3.5.5;
Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
1> stop timer T310, if running;
1> start timer T311;
1> suspend all RBs except SRB0;
1> reset MAC;
1> release the SCell(s), if configured, in accordance with 5.3.10.3a;
1> apply the default physical channel configuration as specified in 9.2.4;
1> apply the default semi-persistent scheduling configuration as specified in
9.2.3;
1> apply the default MAC main configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1> release _powerPrefIndicationConfig_ , if configured and stop timer T340, if
running;
1> release _reportProximityConfig_ and clear any associated proximity status
reporting timer;
1> release _obtainLocationConfig_ , if configured;
1> release _idc-Config_ , if configured;
1> release _measSubframePatternPCell_ , if configured;
1> if connected as an RN and configured with an RN subframe configuration:
2> release the RN subframe configuration;
1> perform cell selection in accordance with the cell selection process as
specified in TS 36.304 [4];

1> apply the _timeAlignmentTimerCommon_ included in
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ ;
1> initiate transmission of the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message
in accordance with 5.3.7.4;
NOTE: This procedure applies also if the UE returns to the source PCell.
Upon selecting an inter-RAT cell, the UE shall:
1> if the selected cell is a UTRA cell, and if the UE supports Radio Link
Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO, include _selectedUTRA-CellId_ in the
_VarRLF-Report_ and set it to the physical cell identity and carrier frequency
of the selected UTRA cell;
1> perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with
release cause \'RRC connection failure\';
#### 5.3.7.4 Actions related to transmission of
_RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message
If the procedure was initiated due to radio link failure or handover failure,
the UE shall:
1> set the _reestablishmentCellId_ in the _VarRLF-Report_ to the global cell
identity of the selected cell;
The UE shall set the contents of _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message
as follows:
1> set the _ue-Identity_ as follows:
2> set the _c-RNTI_ to the C-RNTI used in the source PCell (handover and
mobility from E-UTRA failure) or used in the PCell in which the trigger for
the re-establishment occurred (other cases);
2> set the _physCellId_ to the physical cell identity of the source PCell
(handover and mobility from E-UTRA failure) or of the PCell in which the
trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other cases);

calculated:
3> over the ASN.1 encoded as per section 8 (i.e., a multiple of 8 bits)
_VarShortMAC-Input_ ;
3> with the K~RRCint~ key and integrity protection algorithm that was used in
the source PCell (handover and mobility from E-UTRA failure) or of the PCell
in which the trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other cases); and
3> with all input bits for COUNT, BEARER and DIRECTION set to binary ones;
1> set the _reestablishmentCause_ as follows:
2> if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to reconfiguration
failure as specified in 5.3.5.5 (the UE is unable to comply with the
reconfiguration):
3> set the _reestablishmentCause_ to the value _reconfigurationFailure_ ;
2> else if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to handover
failure as specified in 5.3.5.6 (intra-LTE handover failure) or 5.4.3.5
(inter-RAT mobility from EUTRA failure):
3> set the _reestablishmentCause_ to the value _handoverFailure_ ;
2> else:
3> set the _reestablishmentCause_ to the value _otherFailure_ ;
The UE shall submit the _RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest_ message to lower
layers for transmission.

#### 5.3.14.1 General
Figure 5.3.14.1-1: Proximity indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate that the UE is entering or
leaving the proximity of one or more CSG member cells. The detection of
proximity is based on an autonomous search function as defined in TS 36.304
[4].
#### 5.3.14.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED shall:
1> if the UE enters the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) on an
E-UTRA frequency while proximity indication is enabled for such E-UTRA cells;
or
1> if the UE enters the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) on an UTRA
frequency while proximity indication is enabled for such UTRA cells; or
1> if the UE leaves the proximity of all CSG member cell(s) on an E-UTRA
frequency while proximity indication is enabled for such E-UTRA cells; or
1> if the UE leaves the proximity of all CSG member cell(s) on an UTRA
frequency while proximity indication is enabled for such UTRA cells:
2> if the UE has previously not transmitted a _ProximityIndication_ for the
RAT and frequency during the current RRC connection, or if more than 5 s has
elapsed since the UE has last transmitted a _ProximityIndication_ (either
entering or leaving) for the RAT and frequency:
3> initiate transmission of the _ProximityIndication_ message in accordance

transmission.
### 5.3.15 Void
## 5.4 Inter-RAT mobility
### 5.4.1 Introduction
The general principles of connected mode mobility are described in 5.3.1.3.
The general principles of the security handling upon connected mode mobility
are described in 5.3.1.2.
For the (network controlled) inter RAT mobility from E-UTRA for a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED, a single procedure is defined that supports both handover, cell
change order with optional network assistance (NACC) and enhanced CS fallback
to CDMA2000 1xRTT. In case of mobility to CDMA2000, the eNB decides when to
move to the other RAT while the target RAT determines to which cell the UE
shall move.
### 5.4.2 Handover to E-UTRA
#### 5.4.2.1 General
Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to E-UTRA, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network,
transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g.
GERAN or UTRAN) to E-UTRAN.
The handover to E-UTRA procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination
with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from UTRAN to E-UTRAN
applies only after integrity has been activated in UTRAN.
#### 5.4.2.2 Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the Handover to E-UTRA procedure, in
accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending
the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message via the radio access technology
from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated
in the other RAT;
\- to establish SRB1, SRB2 and one or more DRBs, i.e. at least the DRB
associated with the default EPS bearer is established;
#### 5.4.2.3 Reception of the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ by the UE
If the UE is able to comply with the configuration included in the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message, the UE shall:

_cipheringAlgorithm_ , as specified in TS 33.401 [32];
1> configure lower layers to apply the indicated integrity protection
algorithm and the K~RRCint~ key immediately, i.e. the indicated integrity
protection configuration shall be applied to all subsequent messages received
and sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful
completion of the procedure;
1> configure lower layers to apply the indicated ciphering algorithm, the
K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key immediately, i.e. the indicated ciphering

3> include _connEstFailInfoAvailable_ ;
1> submit the _RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete_ message to lower layers
for transmission using the new configuration;
1> if the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message does not include _rlf-
TimersAndConstants set to setup_ :
2> use the default values specified in 9.2.5 for timer T310, T311 and constant
N310, N311;
1> if MAC successfully completes the random access procedure:
2> stop timer T304;
2> apply the parts of the CQI reporting configuration, the scheduling request
configuration and the sounding RS configuration that do not require the UE to
know the SFN of the target PCell, if any;
2> apply the parts of the measurement and the radio resource configuration
that require the UE to know the SFN of the target PCell (e.g. measurement
gaps, periodic CQI reporting, scheduling request configuration, sounding RS
configuration), if any, upon acquiring the SFN of the target PCell;
NOTE 1: Whenever the UE shall setup or reconfigure a configuration in
accordance with a field that is received it applies the new configuration,
except for the cases addressed by the above statements.
2> enter E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED, upon which the procedure ends;
NOTE 2: The UE is not required to determine the SFN of the target PCell by
acquiring system information from that cell before performing RACH access in
the target PCell.

The UE shall:
1> if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in
the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message:
2> perform the actions defined for this failure case as defined in the
specifications applicable for the other RAT;
NOTE 1: The UE may apply above failure handling also in case the
_RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message causes a protocol error for which the
generic error handling as defined in 5.7 specifies that the UE shall ignore
the message.
NOTE 2: If the UE is unable to comply with part of the configuration, it does
not apply any part of the configuration, i.e. there is no partial success/
failure.
#### 5.4.2.5 T304 expiry (handover to E-UTRA failure)
The UE shall:
1> upon T304 expiry (handover to E-UTRA failure):
2> reset MAC;
2> perform the actions defined for this failure case as defined in the
specifications applicable for the other RAT;
### 5.4.3 Mobility from E-UTRA
#### 5.4.3.1 General
Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from E-UTRA, successful
Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from E-UTRA, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using
another Radio Access Technology (RAT), e.g. GERAN, UTRA or CDMA2000 systems.
The mobility from E-UTRA procedure covers the following type of mobility:
\- handover, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes radio
resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
\- cell change order, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message may include
information facilitating access of and/ or connection establishment in the
target cell, e.g. system information. Cell change order is applicable only to
GERAN; and
\- enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT, i.e. the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_
message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the
target cell. The enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT may be combined with
concurrent handover or redirection to CDMA2000 HRPD.
NOTE: For the case of dual receiver/transmitter enhanced CS fallback to
CDMA2000 1xRTT, the _DLInformationTransfer_ message is used instead of the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message (see TS 36.300 [9]).
#### 5.4.3.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the mobility from E-UTRA procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ message or in response to
reception of CS fallback indication for the UE from MME, by sending a
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message. E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- the procedure is initiated only when AS-security has been activated, and
SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended;
#### 5.4.3.3 Reception of the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message and
perform a cell change order to GERAN, even if no prior UE measurements have
been performed on the target cell.
The UE shall:
1> stop timer T310, if running;
1> if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set to
_handover_ :
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _utra_ or _geran_ :
3> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards the RAT indicated by the
_targetRAT-Type_ included in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message;
3> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromEUTRA_ to the upper layers;
3> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specifications of the target RAT;
> 3> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _geran_ :
4> use the contents of _systemInformation_ , if provided for PS Handover, as
the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
NOTE 1: If there are DRBs for which no radio bearers are established in the
target RAT as indicated in the _targetRAT-MessageContainer_ in the message,
the E-UTRA RRC part of the UE does not indicate the release of the concerned
DRBs to the upper layers. Upper layers may derive which bearers are not
established from information received from the AS of the target RAT.
NOTE 2: In case of SR-VCC, the DRB to be replaced is specified in [61].
2> else if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _cdma2000-1XRTT_ or _cdma2000-HRPD_
:
3> forward the _targetRAT-Type_ and the _targetRAT-MessageContainer_ to the
CDMA2000 upper layers for the UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-
RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the CDMA2000 target-RAT;
1> else if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set
to _cellChangeOrder_ :
2> start timer T304 with the timer value set to _t304,_ as included in the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message;
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _geran_ :
3> if _networkControlOrder_ is included in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_
message:
4> apply the value as specified in TS 44.060 [36];
3> else:
4> acquire _networkControlOrder_ and apply the value as specified in TS 44.060
[36];
3> use the contents of _systemInformation_ , if provided, as the system
information to begin access on the target GERAN cell;
2> establish the connection to the target cell indicated in the
_CellChangeOrder_ ;
NOTE 3: The criteria for success or failure of the cell change order to GERAN
are specified in TS 44.060[36].
1> if the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message includes the _purpose_ set to _e-
CSFB_ :
2> if _messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT_ is present:
3> forward the _messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers for
the UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specification of the target RAT;
2> if _mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD_ is present and is set to _handover_ :
3> forward the _messageContCDMA2000-HRPD_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers for the
UE to access the cell(s) indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with
the specification of the target RAT;
2> if _mobilityCDMA2000-HRPD_ is present and is set to _redirection_ :
3> forward the _redirectCarrierCDMA2000-HRPD_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
NOTE 4: When the CDMA2000 upper layers in the UE receive both the
_messageContCDMA2000-1XRTT_ and _messageContCDMA2000-HRPD_ the UE performs
concurrent access to both CDMA2000 1xRTT and CDMA2000 HRPD RAT.
NOTE 5: The UE should perform the handover, the cell change order or enhanced
1xRTT CS fallback as soon as possible following the reception of the RRC
message _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ , which could be before confirming
successful reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.
#### 5.4.3.4 Successful completion of the mobility from E-UTRA
Upon successfully completing the handover, the cell change order or enhanced
1xRTT CS fallback, the UE shall:
1> perform the actions upon leaving RRC_CONNECTED as specified in 5.3.12, with
release cause \'other\';
NOTE: If the UE performs enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback along with concurrent
mobility to CDMA2000 HRPD and the connection to either CDMA2000 1xRTT or
CDMA2000 HRPD succeeds, then the mobility from E-UTRA is considered
successful.
#### 5.4.3.5 Mobility from E-UTRA failure
The UE shall:
1> if T304 expires (mobility from E-UTRA failure); or
1> if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target
radio access technology; or
1> if the UE is unable to comply with (part of) the configuration included in
the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message; or
1> if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the
_MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message, causing the UE to fail the procedure
according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:
2> stop T304, if running;
2> if the _cs-FallbackIndicator_ in the _MobilityFromEUTRACommand_ message was
set to _TRUE_ or _e-CSFB_ was present:
_3 >_ indicate to upper layers that the CS Fallback procedure has failed;
2> revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell, excluding the
configuration configured by the _physicalConfigDedicated_ , _mac-MainConfig_
and _sps-Config_ ;
2> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in 5.3.7;
NOTE: For enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT, the above UE behavior
applies only when the UE is attempting the enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback and
connection to the target radio access technology fails or if the UE is
attempting enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback along with concurrent mobility to
CDMA2000 HRPD and connection to both the target radio access technologies
fails.
### 5.4.4 Handover from E-UTRA preparation request (CDMA2000)
#### 5.4.4.1 General
Figure 5.4.4.1-1: Handover from E-UTRA preparation request
The purpose of this procedure is to trigger the UE to prepare for handover or
enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback to CDMA2000 by requesting a connection with this
network. The UE may use this procedure to concurrently prepare for handover to
CDMA2000 HRPD along with preparation for enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000
1xRTT. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs only.
This procedure is also used to trigger the UE which supports dual Rx/Tx
enhanced 1xCSFB to redirect its second radio to CDMA2000 1xRTT.
The handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure applies when signalling
radio bearers are established.
#### 5.4.4.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the handover from E-UTRA preparation request procedure to a
UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ message or
CS fallback indication for the UE, by sending a
_HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message. E-UTRA initiates the procedure
only when AS security has been activated.
#### 5.4.4.3 Reception of the _HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ by the UE
Upon reception of the _HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message, the UE
shall:
1> if _dualRxTxRedirectIndicator_ is present in the received message:
2> forward _dualRxTxRedirectIndicator_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2> forward _redirectCarrierCDMA2000-1XRTT_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers, if
included;
1> else:
2> indicate the request to prepare handover or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback and
forward the _cdma2000-Type_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2> if _cdma2000-Type_ is set to _type1XRTT_ :
3> forward the _rand_ and the _mobilityParameters_ to the CDMA2000 upper
layers;
2> if _concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD_ is present in the received message:
3> forward _concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD_ to the CDMA2000 upper layers;
2> else:
3> forward _concurrPrepCDMA2000-HRPD_ , with its value set to _FALSE_ , to the
CDMA2000 upper layers;
### 5.4.5 UL handover preparation transfer (CDMA2000)
#### 5.4.5.1 General
Figure 5.4.5.1-1: UL handover preparation transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to tunnel the handover related CDMA2000
dedicated information or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback related CDMA2000 dedicated
information from UE to E-UTRAN when requested by the higher layers. The
procedure is triggered by the higher layers on receipt of
_HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest_ message. If preparing for enhanced CS
fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT and handover to CDMA2000 HRPD, the UE sends two
consecutive _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ messages to E-UTRAN, one per
addressed CDMA2000 RAT Type. This procedure applies to CDMA2000 capable UEs
only.
#### 5.4.5.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL Handover Preparation Transfer procedure
whenever there is a need to transfer handover or enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback
related non-3GPP dedicated information. The UE initiates the UL handover
preparation transfer procedure by sending the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_
message.
#### 5.4.5.3 Actions related to transmission of the
_ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
as follows:
1> include the _cdma2000-Type_ and the _dedicatedInfo_ ;
1> if the _cdma2000-Type_ is set to _type1XRTT_ :
2> include the _meid_ and set it to the value received from the CDMA2000 upper
layers;
1> submit the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
#### 5.4.5.4 Failure to deliver the _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message
The UE shall:
1> if the UE is unable to guarantee successful delivery of
_ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ messages:
2> inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information
contained in the concerned _ULHandoverPreparationTransfer_ message;
### 5.4.6 Inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN
#### 5.4.6.1 General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell change order to E-UTRAN procedure is to
transfer, under the control of the source radio access technology, a
connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/ GPRS)
to E-UTRAN.
#### 5.4.6.2 Initiation
The procedure is initiated when a radio access technology other than E-UTRAN,
e.g. GSM/GPRS, using procedures specific for that RAT, orders the UE to change
to an E-UTRAN cell. In response, upper layers request the establishment of an
RRC connection as specified in subclause 5.3.3.
NOTE: Within the message used to order the UE to change to an E-UTRAN cell,
the source RAT should specify the identity of the target E-UTRAN cell as
specified in the specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1> upon receiving an _RRCConnectionSetup_ message:
2> consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have completed
successfully;
#### 5.4.6.3 UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell change order
If the inter-RAT cell change order fails the UE shall return to the other
radio access technology and proceed as specified in the appropriate
specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1> upon failure to establish the RRC connection as specified in subclause
5.3.3:
2> consider the inter-RAT cell change order procedure to have failed;
NOTE: The cell change was network ordered. Therefore, failure to change to the
target PCell should not cause the UE to move to UE-controlled cell selection.
## 5.5 Measurements
### 5.5.1 Introduction
The UE reports measurement information in accordance with the measurement
configuration as provided by E-UTRAN. E-UTRAN provides the measurement
configuration applicable for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED by means of dedicated
signalling, i.e. using the _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ message.
The UE can be requested to perform the following types of measurements:
\- Intra-frequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier
frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).
\- Inter-frequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ from
any of the downlink carrier frequency(ies) of the serving cell(s).
\- Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of GERAN frequencies.
\- Inter-RAT measurements of CDMA2000 HRPD or CDMA2000 1xRTT frequencies.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1\. **Measurement objects:** The objects on which the UE shall perform the
measurements.
\- For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object
is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this carrier frequency,
E-UTRAN can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of
\'blacklisted\' cells. Blacklisted cells are not considered in event
evaluation or measurement reporting.
\- For inter-RAT UTRA measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a
single UTRA carrier frequency.
\- For inter-RAT GERAN measurements a measurement object is a set of GERAN
carrier frequencies.
\- For inter-RAT CDMA2000 measurements a measurement object is a set of cells
on a single (HRPD or 1xRTT) carrier frequency.
NOTE 1: Some measurements using the above mentioned measurement objects, only
concern a single cell, e.g. measurements used to report neighbouring cell
system information, PCell UE Rx-Tx time difference.
2\. **Reporting configurations** : A list of reporting configurations where
each reporting configuration consists of the following:
\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a
measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.
\- Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement
report and associated information (e.g. number of cells to report).
3\. **Measurement identities** : A list of measurement identities where each
measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting
configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities it is possible
to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration,
as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same
measurement object. The measurement identity is used as a reference number in
the measurement report.
4\. **Quantity configurations:** One quantity configuration is configured per
RAT type. The quantity configuration defines the measurement quantities and
associated filtering used for all event evaluation and related reporting of
that measurement type. One filter can be configured per measurement quantity.
5\. **Measurement gaps:** Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements,
i.e. no (UL, DL) transmissions are scheduled.
E-UTRAN only configures a single measurement object for a given frequency,
i.e. it is not possible to configure two or more measurement objects for the
same frequency with different associated parameters, e.g. different offsets
and/ or blacklists. E-UTRAN may configure multiple instances of the same event
e.g. by configuring two reporting configurations with different thresholds.
The UE maintains a single measurement object list, a single reporting
configuration list, and a single measurement identities list. The measurement
object list includes measurement objects, that are specified per RAT type,
possibly including intra-frequency object(s) (i.e. the object(s) corresponding
to the serving frequency(ies)), inter-frequency object(s) and inter-RAT
objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes E-UTRA and
inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to
any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting
configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some
measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1\. The serving cell(s)-- these are the PCell and one or more SCells, if
configured for a UE supporting CA.
2\. Listed cells - these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3\. Detected cells - these are cells that are not listed within the
measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the carrier frequency(ies)
indicated by the measurement object(s).
For E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s), listed cells
and detected cells. For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed
cells and optionally on cells that are within a range for which reporting is
allowed by E-UTRAN. For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on
detected cells. For inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed
cells.
NOTE 2: For inter-RAT UTRA and CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports also on
detected cells for the purpose of SON.
NOTE 3: This specification is based on the assumption that typically CSG cells
of home deployment type are not indicated within the neighbour list.
Furthermore, the assumption is that for non-home deployments, the physical
cell identity is unique within the area of a large macro cell (i.e. as for
UTRAN).
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in sub-clause
5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the _VarMeasConfig_
unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration
procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received _measConfig_.
### 5.5.2 Measurement configuration
#### 5.5.2.1 General
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- to ensure that, whenever the UE has a _measConfig_ , it includes a
_measObject_ for each serving frequency;
\- to configure at most one measurement identity using a reporting
configuration with the _purpose_ set to _reportCGI_ ;
\- for serving frequencies, set the EARFCN within the corresponding
_measObject_ according to the band as used for reception/ transmission;
The UE shall:
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _measObjectToRemoveList_ :
2> perform the measurement object removal procedure as specified in 5.5.2.4;
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _measObjectToAddModList_ :
2> perform the measurement object addition/ modification procedure as
specified in 5.5.2.5;
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _reportConfigToRemoveList_ :

2> perform the measurement gap configuration procedure as specified in
5.5.2.9;
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _s-Measure_ :
2> set the parameter _s-Measure_ within _VarMeasConfig_ to the lowest value of
the RSRP ranges indicated by the received value of _s-Measure_ ;
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _preRegistrationInfoHRPD_ :
2> forward the _preRegistrationInfoHRPD_ to CDMA2000 upper layers;
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _speedStatePars_ :
2> set the parameter _speedStatePars_ within _VarMeasConfig_ to the received
value of _speedStatePars_ ;
1> if the received _measConfig_ includes the _allowInterruptions_ :
2> set the parameter _allowInterruptions_ within _VarMeasConfig_ to the
received value of _allowInterruptions_ ;
#### 5.5.2.2 Measurement identity removal
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the received _measIdToRemoveList_ that is
part of the current UE configuration in _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> remove the entry with the matching _measId_ from the _measIdList_ within
the _VarMeasConfig_ ;
2> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
2> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, and reset the associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this
_measId_ ;
NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the
_measIdToRemoveList_ includes any _measId_ value that is not part of the
current UE configuration.
#### 5.5.2.2a Measurement identity autonomous removal
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if the associated _reportConfig_ concerns an event involving a serving cell
while the concerned serving cell is not configured:
3> remove the _measId_ from the _measIdList_ within the _VarMeasConfig_ ;
3> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
3> stop the periodical reporting timer if running, and reset the associated
information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this _measId_ ;
NOTE 1: The above UE autonomous removal of _measId_ \'s applies only for
measurement events A1, A2 and A6.
NOTE 2: When performed during re-establishment, the UE is only configured with
a primary frequency (i.e. the SCell(s) are released, if configured).
#### 5.5.2.3 Measurement identity addition/ modification
E-UTRAN applies the procedure as follows:
\- configure a _measId_ only if the corresponding measurement object, the
corresponding reporting configuration and the corresponding quantity
configuration, are configured;
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the received _measIdToAddModList_ :
2> if an entry with the matching _measId_ exists in the _measIdList_ within
the _VarMeasConfig_ :
3> replace the entry with the value received for this _measId_ ;
2> else:
3> add a new entry for this _measId_ within the _VarMeasConfig_ ;
2> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
2> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, and reset the associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this
_measId_ ;
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to _periodical_ and the _purpose_ is set to
_reportCGI_ in the _reportConfig_ associated with this _measId_ :
3> if the _measObject_ associated with this _measId_ concerns E-UTRA _:_
4> if the _si-RequestForHO_ is included in the _reportConfig_ associated with
this _measId_ :
> 5> start timer T321 with the timer value set to 150 ms for this _measId_ ;
4> else:
5> start timer T321 with the timer value set to _1 second_ for this _measId;_
3> else if the _measObject_ associated with this _measId_ concerns UTRA _:_
4> if the _si-RequestForHO_ is included in the _reportConfig_ associated with
this _measId_ :
5> for UTRA FDD, start timer T321 with the timer value set to 2 seconds for
this _measId_ ;
5> for UTRA TDD, start timer T321 with the timer value set to [1 second] for
this _measId_ ;
4> else:
5> start timer T321 with the timer value set _to 8 seconds_ for this _measId;_
3> else _:_
4> start timer T321 with the timer value set _to 8 seconds_ for this _measId;_
#### 5.5.2.4 Measurement object removal
The UE shall:
1> for each _measObjectId_ included in the received _measObjectToRemoveList_
that is part of the current UE configuration in _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> remove the entry with the matching _measObjectId_ from the _measObjectList_
within the _VarMeasConfig_ ;

3> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
3> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, and reset the associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this
_measId_ ;
NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the
_measObjectToRemoveList_ includes any _measObjectId_ value that is not part of
the current UE configuration.
#### 5.5.2.5 Measurement object addition/ modification
The UE shall:
1> for each _measObjectId_ included in the received _measObjectToAddModList_ :
2> if an entry with the matching _measObjectId_ exists in the _measObjectList_
within the _VarMeasConfig_ , for this entry:
3> reconfigure the entry with the value received for this _measObject_ ,
except for the fields _cellsToAddModList_ , _blackCellsToAddModList_ ,
_cellsToRemoveList,_ _blackCellsToRemoveList_ and

within _VarMeasConfig_ ;
NOTE 2: The UE does not need to retain the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ in the
_measObject_ after reporting _cgi-Info_.
#### 5.5.2.6 Reporting configuration removal
The UE shall:
1> for each _reportConfigId_ included in the received
_reportConfigToRemoveList_ that is part of the current UE configuration in
_VarMeasConfig_ :
2> remove the entry with the matching _reportConfigId_ from the
_reportConfigList_ within the _VarMeasConfig_ ;
2> remove all _measId_ associated with the _reportConfigId_ from the
_measIdList_ within the _VarMeasConfig_ , if any;
2> if a _measId_ is removed from the _measIdList_ :
3> remove the measurement reporting entry for this _measId_ from the
_VarMeasReportList_ , if included;
3> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, and reset the associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for this

NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the
_reportConfigToRemoveList_ includes any _reportConfigId_ value that is not
part of the current UE configuration.
#### 5.5.2.7 Reporting configuration addition/ modification
The UE shall:
1> for each _reportConfigId_ included in the received
_reportConfigToAddModList_ :
2> if an entry with the matching _reportConfigId_ exists in the
_reportConfigList_ within the _VarMeasConfig_ , for this entry:
3> reconfigure the entry with the value received for this _reportConfig_ ;
3> for each _measId_ associated with this _reportConfigId_ included in the

1> if _measGapConfig_ is set to _setup:_
2> if a measurement gap configuration is already setup, release the
measurement gap configuration;
2> setup the measurement gap configuration indicated by the _measGapConfig_ in
accordance with the received _gapOffset_ , i.e., the first subframe of each
gap occurs at an SFN and subframe meeting the following condition:
SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_gapOffset_ /10);
subframe = _gapOffset_ mod 10;
with _T_ = MGRP/10 as defined in TS 36.133 [16];
1> else:
2> release the measurement gap configuration;
### 5.5.3 Performing measurements
#### 5.5.3.1 General
For all measurements the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in
5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting
criteria or for measurement reporting.
The UE shall:
1> whenever the UE has a _measConfig_ , perform RSRP and RSRQ measurements for
each serving cell _,_ applying for the PCell the time domain measurement
resource restriction in accordance with _measSubframePatternPCell,_ if
configured;
1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if the _purpose_ for the associated _reportConfig_ is set to _reportCGI_ :

in the associated _measObject_ using autonomous gaps as necessary;
3> else:
4> perform the corresponding measurements on the frequency and RAT indicated
in the associated _measObject_ using available idle periods or using
autonomous gaps as necessary;
NOTE 1: If autonomous gaps are used to perform measurements, the UE is allowed
to temporarily abort communication with all serving cell(s), i.e. create
autonomous gaps to perform the corresponding measurements within the limits
specified in TS 36.133 [16]. Otherwise, the UE only supports the measurements
with the purpose set to _reportCGI_ only if E-UTRAN has provided sufficient
idle periods.
3> try to acquire the global cell identity of the cell indicated by the
_cellForWhichToReportCGI_ in the associated _measObject_ by acquiring the
relevant system information from the concerned cell;

associated _measObject_ is an E-UTRAN cell:
4> try to acquire the CSG identity, if the CSG identity is broadcast in the
concerned cell;
4> try to acquire the _trackingAreaCode_ in the concerned cell;
4> try to acquire the list of additional PLMN Identities, as included in the
_plmn-IdentityList_ , if multiple PLMN identities are broadcast in the
concerned cell;
NOTE 2: The \'primary\' PLMN is part of the global cell identity.
3> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the
associated _measObject_ is a UTRAN cell:
4> try to acquire the LAC, the RAC and the list of additional PLMN Identities,
if multiple PLMN identities are broadcast in the concerned cell;
4> try to acquire the CSG identity, if the CSG identity is broadcast in the
concerned cell;
3> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the

4> try to acquire the RAC in the concerned cell;
3> if the cell indicated by the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the
associated _measObject_ is a CDMA2000 cell and the _cdma2000-Type_ included in
the _measObject_ is _typeHRPD_ :
4> try to acquire the Sector ID in the concerned cell;

the _measObject_ is _type1XRTT_ :
4> try to acquire the BASE ID, SID and NID in the concerned cell;
2> else:
3> if a measurement gap configuration is setup; or
3> if the UE does not require measurement gaps to perform the concerned
measurements:
4> if _s-Measure_ is not configured; or
4> if _s-Measure_ is configured and the PCell RSRP, after layer 3 filtering,
is lower than this value:
5> perform the corresponding measurements of neighbouring cells on the

_reportConfig_ :
5> perform the UE Rx--Tx time difference measurements on the PCell;
2> perform the evaluation of reporting criteria as specified in 5.5.4;
NOTE 3: The _s-Measure_ defines when the UE is required to perform
measurements. The UE is however allowed to perform measurements also when the
PCell RSRP exceeds _s-Measure_ , e.g., to measure cells broadcasting a CSG
identity following use of the autonomous search function as defined in TS
36.304 [4].
#### 5.5.3.2 Layer 3 filtering
The UE shall:
1> for each measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according
to 5.5.3.1:
> NOTE 1: This does not include quantities configured solely for UE Rx-Tx time
> difference measurements i.e. for those type of measurements the UE ignores
> the _triggerQuantity_ and _reportQuantity_.
2> filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting
criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:
$F_{n} = (1 - a) \cdot F_{n - 1} + a \cdot M_{n}$
> where
>
> **_M~n~_** is the latest received measurement result from the physical
> layer;
>
> **_F~n~_** is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for
> evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
>
> **_F~n-1~_** is the old filtered measurement result, where **_F~0~_** is set
> to **_M~1~_** when the first measurement result from the physical layer is
> received; and
>
> **_a_** = 1/2^(**_k_** /4)^, where **_k_** is the _filterCoefficient_ for
> the corresponding measurement quantity received by the _quantityConfig;_
2> adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are
preserved at different input rates, observing that the _filterCoefficient_
**_k_** assumes a sample rate equal to 200 ms;
> NOTE 2: If **_k_** is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
>
> NOTE 3: The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation
> of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic
> filtering for logarithmic measurements.
NOTE 4: The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the
performance requirements set in [16]. For further details about the physical
layer measurements, see TS 36.133 [16].
### 5.5.4 Measurement report triggering
#### 5.5.4.1 General
If security has been activated successfully, the UE shall:

the _cellForWhichToReportCGI_ included in the corresponding _measObject_
within the _VarMeasConfig_ to be applicable;

frequency to be applicable when the concerned cell is included in the _csg-
allowedReportingCells_ within the _VarMeasConfig_ for this _measId_ , if
configured in the corresponding _measObjectUTRA_ (i.e. the cell is included in
the range of physical cell identities for which reporting is allowed).
3> else if the corresponding _measObject_ concerns GERAN:
4> consider a neighbouring cell on the associated set of frequencies to be
applicable when the concerned cell matches the _ncc-Permitted_ defined within
the _VarMeasConfig_ for this _measId_ ;
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to _event_ and if the entry condition
applicable for this event, i.e. the event corresponding with the _eventId_ of
the corresponding _reportConfig_ within _VarMeasConfig_ , is fulfilled for one
or more applicable cells for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken
during _timeToTrigger_ defined for this event within the _VarMeasConfig_ ,
while the _VarMeasReportList_ does not include an measurement reporting entry
for this _measId_ (a first cell triggers the event):

or more applicable cells not included in the _cellsTriggeredList_ for all
measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during _timeToTrigger_ defined for
this event within the _VarMeasConfig_ (a subsequent cell triggers the event):

_measId_ for all measurements after layer 3 filtering taken during
_timeToTrigger_ defined within the _VarMeasConfig_ for this event:

_VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ ;
3> if _reportOnLeave_ is set to _TRUE_ for the corresponding reporting
configuration or if _a6-ReportOnLeave_ is set to _TRUE_ for the corresponding
reporting configuration:
4> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
3> if the _cellsTriggeredList_ defined within the _VarMeasReportList_ for this
_measId_ is empty:
4> remove the measurement reporting entry within the _VarMeasReportList_ for
this _measId_ ;
4> stop the periodical reporting timer for this _measId_ , if running;
2> if the _purpose_ is included and set to _reportStrongestCells_ or to
_reportStrongestCellsForSON_ and if a (first) measurement result is available:

this _measId_ ;
3> set the _numberOfReportsSent_ defined within the _VarMeasReportList_ for
this _measId_ to 0;
3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
NOTE 1: If the _purpose_ is set to _reportStrongestCells_ and _reportAmount_ >
1, the UE initiates a first measurement report immediately after the quantity
to be reported becomes available for the PCell. If the _purpose_ is set to
_reportStrongestCells_ and _reportAmount_ = 1, the UE initiates a first
measurement report immediately after the quantity to be reported becomes
available for the PCell and for the strongest cell among the applicable cells.
If the purpose is set to _reportStrongestCellsForSON_ , the UE initiates a
first measurement report when it has determined the strongest cells on the
associated frequency.

this _measId_ ;
3> set the _numberOfReportsSent_ defined within the _VarMeasReportList_ for
this _measId_ to 0;
3> initiate the measurement reporting procedure, as specified in 5.5.5;
NOTE 2: The UE does not stop the periodical reporting with _triggerType_ set
to _event_ or to _periodical_ while the corresponding measurement is not
performed due to the PCell RSRP being equal to or better than _s-Measure_ or
due to the measurement gap not being setup.
NOTE 3: If the UE is configured with DRX, the UE may delay the measurement
reporting for event triggered and periodical triggered measurements until the
Active Time, which is defined in TS 36.321 [6].

### 5.5.5 Measurement reporting
Figure 5.5.5-1: Measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE
to E-UTRAN. UE shall initiate this procedure only after successful security
activation.
For the _measId_ for which the measurement reporting procedure was triggered,
the UE shall set the _measResults_ within the _MeasurementReport_ message as
follows:
1> set the _measId_ to the measurement identity that triggered the measurement
reporting;
1> set the _measResultPCell_ to include the quantities of the PCell;
1> set the _measResultServFreqList_ to include for each SCell that is
configured, if any, within _measResultSCell_ the quantities of the concerned
SCell, if available according to performance requirements in [16];
1> if the _reportConfig_ associated with the _measId_ that triggered the
measurement reporting includes _reportAddNeighMeas_ :
2> for each serving frequency for which _measObjectId_ is referenced in the
_measIdList_ , other than the frequency corresponding with the _measId_ that
triggered the measurement reporting:
3> set the _measResultServFreqList_ to include within
_measResultBestNeighCell_ the _physCellId_ and the quantities of the best non-
serving cell, based on RSRP, on the concerned serving frequency;
1> if there is at least one applicable neighbouring cell to report:
2> set the _measResultNeighCells_ to include the best neighbouring cells up to
_maxReportCells_ in accordance with the following:
3> if the _triggerType_ is set to _event_ :
4> include the cells included in the _cellsTriggeredList_ as defined within
the _VarMeasReportList_ for this _measId_ ;
3> else:
4> include the applicable cells for which the new measurement results became
available since the last periodical reporting or since the measurement was
initiated or reset;
NOTE: The reliability of the report (i.e. the certainty it contains the
strongest cells on the concerned frequency) depends on the measurement
configuration i.e. the _reportInterval_. The related performance requirements
are specified in TS 36.133 [16].
3> for each cell that is included in the _measResultNeighCells_ , include the
_physCellId_ ;
3> if the _triggerType_ is set to _event_ ; or the _purpose_ is set to
_reportStrongestCells_ or to _reportStrongestCellsForSON_ :
4> for each included cell, include the layer 3 filtered measured results in
accordance with the _reportConfig_ for this _measId_ , ordered as follows:
5> if the _measObject_ associated with this _measId_ concerns E-UTRA:

### 5.5.6 Measurement related actions
#### 5.5.6.1 Actions upon handover and re-establishment
E-UTRAN applies the handover procedure as follows:
\- when performing the handover procedure, as specified in 5.3.5.4, ensure
that a _measObjectId_ corresponding to each handover target serving frequency
is configured as a result of the procedures described in this sub-clause and
in 5.3.5.4;
\- when changing the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged,
E-UTRAN releases the _measObject_ corresponding to the source frequency and
adds a _measObject_ corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not
reconfigure the _measObject_);
E-UTRAN applies the re-establishment procedure as follows:
\- when performing the connection re-establishment procedure, as specified in
5.3.7, ensure that a _measObjectId_ corresponding each target serving
frequency is configured as a result of the procedure described in this sub-
clause and the subsequent connection reconfiguration procedure immediately
following the re-establishment procedure;
\- in the first reconfiguration following the re-establishment when changing
the band while the physical frequency remains unchanged, E-UTRAN releases the
_measObject_ corresponding to the source frequency and adds a _measObject_
corresponding to the target frequency (i.e. it does not reconfigure the
_measObject_);
The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
2> if the _triggerType_ is set to _periodical_ :
3> remove this _measId_ from the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
1> if the procedure was triggered due to a handover or successful re-
establishment and the procedure involves a change of primary frequency, update
the _measId_ values in the _measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ as follows:
2> if a _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the target primary frequency
exists in the _measObjectList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ :
3> for each _measId_ value in the _measIdList_ :
4> if the _measId_ value is linked to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding
to the source primary frequency:
5> link this _measId_ value to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the
target primary frequency;
4> else if the _measId_ value is linked to the _measObjectId_ value
corresponding to the target primary frequency:
5> link this _measId_ value to the _measObjectId_ value corresponding to the
source primary frequency;
2> else:
3> remove all _measId_ values that are linked to the _measObjectId_ value
corresponding to the source primary frequency;
1> remove all measurement reporting entries within _VarMeasReportList_ ;
1> stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321, whichever one is
running, as well as associated information (e.g. _timeToTrigger_) for all
_measId_ ;
1> release the measurement gaps, if activated;
NOTE: If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency or inter-
RAT measurements, the UE resumes the inter-frequency and inter-RAT
measurements after the E-UTRAN has setup the measurement gaps.
#### 5.5.6.2 Speed dependant scaling of measurement related parameters
The UE shall adjust the value of the following parameter configured by the
E-UTRAN depending on the UE speed: _timeToTrigger_. The UE shall apply 3
different levels, which are selected as follows:
The UE shall:
1> perform mobility state detection using the mobility state detection as
specified in TS 36.304 [4] with the following modifications:
2> counting handovers instead of cell reselections;
2> applying the parameter applicable for RRC_CONNECTED as included in
_speedStatePars_ within _VarMeasConfig;_
> 1> if high mobility state is detected:
2> use the _timeToTrigger_ value multiplied by _sf-High_ within
_VarMeasConfig_ ;
> 1> else if medium mobility state is detected:
2> use the _timeToTrigger_ value multiplied by _sf-Medium_ within
_VarMeasConfig_ ;
1> else:
> 2> no scaling is applied;
### 5.5.7 Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication
#### 5.5.7.1 General
Figure 5.5.7.1-1: Inter-frequency RSTD measurement indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is
going to start/stop OTDOA inter-frequency RSTD measurements which require
measurement gaps as specified in [16, 8.1.2.6].
NOTE: It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
#### 5.5.7.2 Initiation
The UE shall:
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing inter-frequency
RSTD measurements and the UE requires measurement gaps for these measurements
while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2> initiate the procedure to indicate start;
NOTE 1: The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the
indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are
available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new
indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the
procedure in the same PCell once per frequency if the provided measurement
gaps are insufficient.
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing inter-frequency
RSTD measurements:
2> initiate the procedure to indicate stop;
NOTE 2: The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it did not
previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.
#### 5.5.7.3 Actions related to transmission of
_InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication_ message
The UE shall set the contents of _InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication_ message
as follows:
1> set the _rstd-InterFreqIndication_ as follows:
2> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of inter-frequency RSTD
measurements:
3> set the _rstd-InterFreqInfoList_ according to the information received from
upper layers;
2> else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of inter-frequency RSTD
measurements:
3> set the _rstd-InterFreqIndication_ to the value _stop_ ;
1> submit the _InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;

full, stop timer T330 and perform the same actions as performed upon expiry of
T330, as specified in 5.6.6.4;
### 5.6.9 In-device coexistence indication
#### 5.6.9.1 General
Figure 5.6.9.1-1: In-device coexistence indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN about (a change of) the In-
Device Coexistence (IDC) problems experienced by the UE in RRC_CONNECTED, as
described in TS 36.300 [9], and to provide the E-UTRAN with information in
order to resolve them.
#### 5.6.9.2 Initiation
A UE capable of providing IDC indications may initiate the procedure when it
is configured to provide IDC indications and upon change of IDC problem
information.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if configured to provide IDC indications:
2> if the UE did not transmit an _InDeviceCoexIndication message_ since it was
configured to provide IDC indications:
3> if on one or more frequencies for which a _measObjectEUTRA_ is configured,
the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if on one or more
supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies for which a
measurement object is configured, the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it
cannot solve by itself:
4> initiate transmission of the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.6.9.3;
2> else:
3> if the set of frequencies, for which a _measObjectEUTRA_ is configured and
on which the UE is experiencing IDC problems that it cannot solve by itself,
is different from the set indicated in the last transmitted
_InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if for one or more of the frequencies in the previously reported set of
frequencies, the _interferenceDirection_ is different from the value indicated
in the last transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if the TDM assistance information is different from the assistance
information included in the last transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message;
or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if the
_victimSystemType_ is different from the value indicated in the last
transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message; or
3> if configured to provide IDC indications for UL CA; and if the set of
supported UL CA combinations on which the UE is experiencing IDC problems that
it cannot solve by itself and that the UE includes in
_affectedCarrierFreqCombList_ according to 5.6.9.3, is different from the set
indicated in the last transmitted _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message:
4> initiate transmission of the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.6.9.3;
#### 5.6.9.3 Actions related to transmission of _InDeviceCoexIndication_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message as
follows:
> 1> if there is at least one E-UTRA carrier frequency, for which a
> measurement object is configured, that is affected by IDC problems:
2> include the IE _affectedCarrierFreqList_ with an entry for each affected
E-UTRA carrier frequency for which a measurement object is configured;
2> for each E-UTRA carrier frequency included in the the IE
_affectedCarrierFreqList_ , include _interferenceDirection_ and set it
accordingly;
2> include Time Domain Multiplexing (TDM) based assistance information:
3> if the UE has DRX related assistance information that could be used to
resolve the IDC problems:
4> include _drx-CycleLength_ , _drx-Offset_ and _drx-ActiveTime_ ;
3> else (the UE has desired subframe reservation patterns related assistance
information that could be used to resolve the IDC problems):
4> include _idc-SubframePatternList_ ;
1> if the UE is configured to provide UL CA information and there is a
supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies for which a
measurement object is configured, that is affected by IDC problems:
2> include _victimSystemType_ in _ul-CA-AssistanceInfo_ ;
2> include _affectedCarrierFreqCombList_ in _ul-CA-AssistanceInfo_ with an
entry for each supported UL CA combination comprising of carrier frequencies
for which a measurement object is configured, that is affected by IDC
problems;
NOTE 1: When sending an _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message to inform E-UTRAN the
IDC problems, the UE includes all assistance information (rather than
providing e.g. the changed part(s) of the assistance information).
NOTE 2: Upon not anymore experiencing a particular IDC problem that the UE
previously reported, the UE provides an IDC indication with the modified
contents of the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message (e.g. by an empty message).
The UE shall submit the _InDeviceCoexIndication_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
### 5.6.10 UE Assistance Information
#### 5.6.10.1 General
Figure 5.6.10.1-1: UE Assistance Information
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN of the UE\'s power saving
preference. Upon configuring the UE to provide power preference indications
E-UTRAN may consider that the UE does not prefer a configuration primarily
optimised for power saving until the UE explictly indicates otherwise.
#### 5.6.10.2 Initiation
A UE capable of providing power preference indications in RRC_CONNECTED may
initiate the procedure in several cases including upon being configured to
provide power preference indications and upon change of power preference.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if configured to provide power preference indications:
2> if the UE did not transmit a _UEAssistanceInformation_ message since it was
configured to provide power preference indications; or
2> if the current power preference is different from the one indicated in the
last transmission of the _UEAssistanceInformation_ message and timer T340 is
not running:
3> initiate transmission of the _UEAssistanceInformation_ message in
accordance with 5.6.10.3;
#### 5.6.10.3 Actions related to transmission of _UEAssistanceInformation_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _UEAssistanceInformation_ message:
1> if the UE prefers a configuration primarily optimised for power saving:
2> set _powerPrefIndication_ to _lowPowerConsumption_ ;
1> else:
2> start or restart timer T340 with the timer value set to the
_powerPrefIndicationTimer_ ;
2> set _powerPrefIndication_ to _normal_ ;
The UE shall submit the _UEAssistanceInformation_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
## 5.7 Generic error handling
### 5.7.1 General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent sub-clauses applies
unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error
handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
\- to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer
syntax supported by the UE.
\- to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific
behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved
value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
\- as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour
that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/ reserved field.
### 5.7.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1> when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, PCCH, CCCH, or MCCH for which
the abstract syntax is invalid [13]:
2> ignore the message;
NOTE This section applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other
than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the
transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined
as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably
detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message
level.
### 5.7.3 Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not
comprehend:
2> if a default value is defined for this field:
3> treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2> else if the concerned field is optional:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the
need code for absence of the concerned field;
2> else:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with sub-
clause 5.7.4;
### 5.7.4 Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1> if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message
(e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field
is absent or treated as absent:
2> if the RRC message was received on DCCH or CCCH:
3> ignore the message;
2> else:
3> if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE
OF):
4> treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended
field was not present;
3> else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the
\'parent\' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the
erroneous field:
4> consider the \'parent\' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4> apply the generic error handling to the subsequent \'parent\' field(s),
until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3> else (field at message level):
4> ignore the message;
NOTE 1: The error handling defined in these sub-clauses implies that the UE
ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended
value.
NOTE 2: The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels
other than DCCH and CCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for
errors that can be regarded as invalid E-UTRAN operation e.g. E-UTRAN not
observing conditional presence.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested
error handling for errors in extension fields.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
\-- Example with extension addition group
ItemInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OF ItemInfo
ItemInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
...
[[ field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL -- Need ON
]]
}
\-- Example with traditional non-critical extension (empty sequence)
BroadcastInfoBlock1 ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs::= SEQUENCE {
field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL -- Need OP
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable
in case of nested error handling:
\- an extension additon group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in
the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of
_field3_ would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than
just the extension addition group containing _field3_ and _field4_)
\- a traditional _nonCriticalExtension_ is not regarded as a level on its own.
E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the
conditionality of _field3_ would result in the entire _BroadcastInfoBlock1_ to
be ignored (rather than just the non critical extension containing _field3_
and _field4_).
### 5.7.5 Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2> treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent;
NOTE: This section does not apply to the case of an extension to the value
range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in
section 5.7.3.
## 5.8 MBMS
### 5.8.1 Introduction
#### 5.8.1.1 General
In general the control information relevant only for UEs supporting MBMS is
separated as much as possible from unicast control information. Most of the
MBMS control information is provided on a logical channel specific for MBMS
common control information: the MCCH. E-UTRA employs one MCCH logical channel
per MBSFN area. In case the network configures multiple MBSFN areas, the UE
acquires the MBMS control information from the MCCHs that are configured to
identify if services it is interested to receive are ongoing. The action
applicable when the UE is unable to simultaneously receive MBMS and unicast
services is up to UE implementation. In this release of the specification, an
MBMS capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service
at a time, and reception of more than one MBMS service (also possibly on more
than one MBSFN area) in parallel is left for UE implementation. The MCCH
carries the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message, which indicates the MBMS
sessions that are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) radio resource
configuration. The MCCH may also carry the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message, when
E-UTRAN wishes to count the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED that are receiving
or interested to receive one or more specific MBMS services.
A limited amount of MBMS control information is provided on the BCCH. This
primarily concerns the information needed to acquire the MCCH(s). This
information is carried by means of a single MBMS specific
_SystemInformationBlock_ : _SystemInformationBlockType13_. An MBSFN area is
identified solely by the _mbsfn-AreaId_ in _SystemInformationBlockType13_. At
mobility, the UE considers that the MBSFN area is continuous when the source
cell and the target cell broadcast the same value in the _mbsfn-AreaId_.
#### 5.8.1.2 Scheduling
The MCCH information is transmitted periodically, using a configurable
repetition period. Scheduling information is not provided for MCCH i.e. both
the time domain scheduling as well as the lower layer configuration are semi-
statically configured, as defined within _SystemInformationBlockType13_.
For MBMS user data, which is carried by the MTCH logical channel, E-UTRAN
periodically provides MCH scheduling information (MSI) at lower layers (MAC).
This MCH information only concerns the time domain scheduling i.e. the
frequency domain scheduling and the lower layer configuration are semi-
statically configured. The periodicity of the MSI is configurable and defined
by the MCH scheduling period.
#### 5.8.1.3 MCCH information validity and notification of changes
Change of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the
concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the
same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its
scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period
boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod _m_ = 0, where _m_ is
the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The
modification period is configured by means of _SystemInformationBlockType13_.
When the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs
about the change during a first modification period. In the next modification
period, the network transmits the updated MCCH information. These general
principles are illustrated in figure 5.8.1.3-1, in which different colours
indicate different MCCH information. Upon receiving a change notification, a
UE interested to receive MBMS services acquires the new MCCH information
immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the
previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH
information.
Figure 5.8.1.3-1: Change of MCCH Information
Indication of an MBMS specific RNTI, the M-RNTI (see TS 36.321 [6]), on PDCCH
is used to inform UEs in RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about an MCCH
information change. When receiving an MCCH information change notification,
the UE knows that the MCCH information will change at the next modification
period boundary. The notification on PDCCH indicates which of the MCCHs will
change, which is done by means of an 8-bit bitmap. Within this bitmap, the bit
at the position indicated by the field _notificationIndicator_ is used to
indicate changes for that MBSFN area: if the bit is set to \"1\", the
corresponding MCCH will change. No further details are provided e.g. regarding
which MCCH information will change. The MCCH information change notification
is used to inform the UE about a change of MCCH information upon session start
or about the start of MBMS counting.
The MCCH information change notifications on PDCCH are transmitted
periodically and are carried on MBSFN subframes only. These MCCH information
change notification occasions are common for all MCCHs that are configured,
and configurable by parameters included in _SystemInformationBlockType13:_ a
repetition coefficient, a radio frame offset and a subframe index. These
common notification occasions are based on the MCCH with the shortest
modification period.
NOTE 1: E-UTRAN may modify the MBMS configuration information provided on MCCH
at the same time as updating the MBMS configuration information carried on
BCCH i.e. at a coinciding BCCH and MCCH modification period. Upon detecting
that a new MCCH is configured on BCCH, a UE interested to receive one or more
MBMS services should acquire the MCCH, unless it knows that the services it is
interested in are not provided by the corresponding MBSFN area.
A UE that is receiving an MBMS service shall acquire the MCCH information from
the start of each modification period. A UE that is not receiving an MBMS
service, as well as UEs that are receiving an MBMS service but potentially
interested to receive other services not started yet in another MBSFN area,
shall verify that the stored MCCH information remains valid by attempting to
find the MCCH information change notification at least
_notificationRepetitionCoeff_ times during the modification period of the
applicable MCCH(s), if no MCCH information change notification is received.
NOTE 2: In case the UE is aware which MCCH(s) E-UTRAN uses for the service(s)
it is interested to receive, the UE may only need to monitor change
notifications for a subset of the MCCHs that are configured, referred to as
the \'applicable MCCH(s)\' in the above.
### 5.8.2 MCCH information acquisition
#### 5.8.2.1 General
Figure 5.8.2.1-1: MCCH information acquisition
The UE applies the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MBMS
control information that is broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies
to MBMS capable UEs that are in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.8.2.2 Initiation
A UE interested to receive MBMS services shall apply the MCCH information
acquisition procedure upon entering the corresponding MBSFN area (e.g. upon
power on, following UE mobility) and upon receiving a notification that the
MCCH information has changed. A UE that is receiving an MBMS service shall
apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MCCH, that
corresponds with the service that is being received, at the start of each
modification period.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the MCCH
information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored MCCH information, i.e.
delta configuration is not applicable for MCCH information and the UE
discontinues using a field if it is absent in MCCH information unless
explicitly specified otherwise.
#### 5.8.2.3 MCCH information acquisition by the UE
An MBMS capable UE shall:
1> if the procedure is triggered by an MCCH information change notification:
2> start acquiring the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message and the
_MBMSCountingRequest_ message if present, from the beginning of the
modification period following the one in which the change notification was
received;
NOTE 1: The UE continues using the previously received MCCH information until
the new MCCH information has been acquired.
1> if the UE enters an MBSFN area:
2> acquire the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message and the _MBMSCountingRequest_
message if present, at the next repetition period;
1> if the UE is receiving an MBMS service:
2> start acquiring the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message and the
_MBMSCountingRequest_ message if present, that both concern the MBSFN area of
the service that is being received, from the beginning of each modification
period;
#### 5.8.2.4 Actions upon reception of the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message
No UE requirements related to the contents of this _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_
apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the
concerned system information, the corresponding field descriptions.
#### 5.8.2.5 Actions upon reception of the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message
Upon receiving _MBMSCountingRequest_ message, the UE shall perform the MBMS
Counting procedure as specified in section 5.8.4.
### 5.8.3 MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration
#### 5.8.3.1 General
The MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration procedure is used by the UE to
configure RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to
receive an MRB. The procedure applies to UEs interested to receive one or more
MBMS services.
NOTE: In case the UE is unable to receive an MBMS service due to capability
limitations, upper layers may take appropriate action e.g. terminate a lower
priority unicast service.
#### 5.8.3.2 Initiation
The UE applies the MRB establishment procedure to start receiving a session of
a service it has an interest in. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon
start of the MBMS session, upon (re-)entry of the corresponding MBSFN service
area, upon becoming interested in the MBMS service, upon removal of UE
capability limitations inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
The UE applies the MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session. The
procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of the MBMS session, upon leaving
the corresponding MBSFN service area, upon losing interest in the MBMS
service, when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the
concerned service.
#### 5.8.3.3 MRB establishment
Upon MRB establishment, the UE shall:
1> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the configuration specified in
9.1.1.4;
1> configure an MTCH logical channel in accordance with the received
_locgicalChannelIdentity_ , applicable for the MRB, as included in the
_MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message;
1> configure the physical layer in accordance with the _pmch-Config_ ,
applicable for the MRB, as included in the _MBSFNAreaConfiguration_ message;
1> inform upper layers about the establishment of the MRB by indicating the
corresponding _tmgi_ and _sessionId_ ;
#### 5.8.3.4 MRB release
Upon MRB release, the UE shall:
1> release the RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer
configuration;
1> inform upper layers about the release of the MRB by indicating the
corresponding _tmgi_ and _sessionId_ ;
### 5.8.4 MBMS Counting Procedure
#### 5.8.4.1 General
Figure 5.8.4.1-1: MBMS Counting procedure
The MBMS Counting procedure is used by the E-UTRAN to count the number of
RRC_CONNECTED mode UEs which are receiving via an MRB or interested to receive
via an MRB the specified MBMS services.
The UE determines interest in an MBMS service, that is identified by the TMGI,
by interaction with upper layers.
#### 5.8.4.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending an _MBMSCountingRequest_ message.
#### 5.8.4.3 Reception of the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message, the UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode
shall:
1> if the _SystemInformationBlockType1,_ that provided the scheduling
information for the _systemInformationBlockType13_ that included the
configuration of the MCCH via which the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message was
received, contained the identity of the Registered PLMN; and
1> if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB at
least one of the services in the received _countingRequestList:_
2> if more than one entry is included in the _mbsfn-AreaInfoList_ received in
the _SystemInformationBlockType13_ that included the configuration of the MCCH
via which the _MBMSCountingRequest_ message was received _:_
3> include the _mbsfn-AreaIndex_ in the _MBMSCountingResponse_ message and set
it to the index of the entry in the _mbsfn-AreaInfoList_ within the received
_SystemInformationBlockType13_ that corresponds with the MBSFN area used to
transfer the received _MBMSCountingRequest_ message;
2> for each MBMS service included in the received _countingRequestList_ :
3> if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB this
MBMS service:
4> include an entry in the _countingResponseList_ within the
_MBMSCountingResponse_ message with _countingResponseService_ set it to the
index of the entry in the _countingRequestList_ within the received
_MBMSCountingRequest_ that corresponds with the MBMS service the UE is
receiving or interested to receive;
2> submit the _MBMSCountingResponse_ message to lower layers for transmission
upon which the procedure ends;
NOTE 1: UEs that are receiving an MBMS User Service [56] by means of a Unicast
Bearer Service [57] (i.e. via a DRB), but are interested to receive the
concerned MBMS User Service [56] via an MBMS Bearer Service (i.e. via an MRB),
respond to the counting request.
NOTE 2: If ciphering is used at upper layers, the UE does not respond to the
counting request if it can not decipher the MBMS service for which counting is
performed (see TS 22.146 [62, 5.3]).
NOTE 3: The UE treats the _MBMSCountingRequest_ messages received in each
modification period independently. In the unlikely case E-UTRAN would repeat
an _MBMSCountingRequest_ (i.e. including the same services) in a subsequent
modification period, the UE responds again. The UE provides at most one
_MBMSCountingResponse_ message to multiple transmission attempts of an
_MBMSCountingRequest_ messages in a given modification period.
### 5.8.5 MBMS interest indication
#### 5.8.5.1 General
Figure 5.8.5.1-1: MBMS interest indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform E-UTRAN that the UE is receiving or
is interested to receive MBMS via an MRB, and if so, to inform E-UTRAN about
the priority of MBMS versus unicast reception.
#### 5.8.5.2 Initiation
An MBMS capable UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in several
cases including upon successful connection establishment, upon entering or
leaving the service area, upon session start or stop, upon change of interest,
upon change of priority between MBMS reception and unicast reception or upon
change to a PCell broadcasting _SystemInformationBlockType15_.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if _SystemInformationBlockType15_ is broadcast by the PCell:
2> ensure having a valid version of _SystemInformationBlockType15_ for the
PCell;
2> if the UE did not transmit an _MBMSInterestIndication_ message since last
entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
2> if since the last time the UE transmitted an _MBMSInterestIndication_
message, the UE connected to a PCell not broadcasting
_SystemInformationBlockType15_ :
3> if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with
5.8.5.3, is not empty:
4> initiate transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.8.5.4;
2> else:
3> if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with
5.8.5.3, has changed since the last transmission of the
_MBMSInterestIndication_ message; or
3> if the prioritisation of reception of all indicated MBMS frequencies
compared to reception of any of the established unicast bearers has changed
since the last transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message:
4> initiate transmission of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message in accordance
with 5.8.5.4;
NOTE: The UE may send an _MBMSInterestIndication_ even when it is able to
receive the MBMS services it is interested in i.e. to avoid that the network
allocates a configuration inhibiting MBMS reception.
#### 5.8.5.3 Determine MBMS frequencies of interest
The UE shall:
1> consider a frequency to be part of the MBMS frequencies of interest if the
following conditions are met:
2> at least one MBMS session the UE is receiving or interested to receive via
an MRB is ongoing or about to start; and
NOTE 1: The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and
stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see 3GPP TS 36.300
[9] or 3GPP TS 26.346 [57].
2> for at least one of these MBMS sessions _SystemInformationBlockType15_
acquired from the PCell includes for the concerned frequency one or more MBMS
SAIs as indicated in the USD for this session; and
NOTE 2: The UE considers a frequency to be part of the MBMS frequencies of
interest even though E-UTRAN may (temporarily) not employ an MRB for the
concerned session. I.e. the UE does not verify if the session is indicated on
MCCH
NOTE 3: The UE considers the frequencies of interest independently of any
synchronization state, e.g. [9, Annex J.1].
2> the UE is capable of simultaneously receiving the set of MBMS frequencies
of interest, regardless of whether a serving cell is configured on each of
these frequencies or not; and
2> the _supportedBandCombination_ the UE included in _UE-EUTRA-Capability_
contains at least one band combination including the set of MBMS frequencies
of interest;
NOTE 4: Indicating a frequency implies that the UE supports
_SystemInformationBlockType13_ acquisition for the concerned frequency i.e.
the indication should be independent of whether a serving cell is configured
on that frequency.
NOTE 5: When evaluating which frequencies it can receive simultaneously, the
UE does not take into account the serving frequencies that are currently
configured i.e. it only considers MBMS frequencies it is interested to
receive.
NOTE 6: The set of MBMS frequencies of interest includes at most one frequency
for a given physical frequency. The UE only considers a physical frequency to
be part of the MBMS frequencies of interest if it supports at least one of the
bands indicated for this physical frequency in _SystemInformationBlockType1_
(for serving frequency) or _SystemInformationBlockType15_ (for neighbouring
frequencies). In this case, E-UTRAN may assume the UE supports MBMS reception
on any of the bands supported by the UE (i.e. according to
_supportedBandCombination_).
#### 5.8.5.4 Actions related to transmission of _MBMSInterestIndication_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message as
follows:
1> if the set of MBMS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with
5.8.5.3, is not empty:
2> include _mbms-FreqList_ and set it to include the MBMS frequencies of
interest, using the EARFCN corresponding with _freqBandIndicator_ included in
_SystemInformationBlockType1 (for serving frequency)_ , if applicable, and the
EARFCN(s) as included in _SystemInformationBlockType15 (for neighbouring
frequencies)_ ;
NOTE 1: The EARFCN included in _mbms-FreqList_ is merely used to indicate a
physical frequency the UE is interested to receive i.e. the UE may not support
the band corresponding to the included EARFCN (but it does support at least
one of the bands indicated in system information for the concerned physical
frequency).
2> include _mbms-Priority_ if the UE prioritises reception of all indicated
MBMS frequencies above reception of any of the unicast bearers;
NOTE 2: If the UE prioritises MBMS reception and unicast data cannot be
supported because of congestion on the MBMS carrier(s), E-UTRAN may initiate
release of unicast bearers. It is up to E-UTRAN implementation whether all
bearers or only GBR bearers are released. E-UTRAN does not initiate re-
establishment of the released unicast bearers upon alleviation of the
congestion.
The UE shall submit the _MBMSInterestIndication_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
## 5.9 RN procedures
### 5.9.1 RN reconfiguration
#### 5.9.1.1 General
Figure 5.9.1.1-1: RN reconfiguration
The purpose of this procedure is to configure/reconfigure the RN subframe
configuration and/or to update the system information relevant for the RN in
RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.9.1.2 Initiation
E-UTRAN may initiate the RN reconfiguration procedure to an RN in
RRC_CONNECTED when AS security has been activated.
#### 5.9.1.3 Reception of the _RNReconfiguration_ by the RN
The RN shall:
1> if the _rn-SystemInfo_ is included:
2> if the _systemInformationBlockType1_ is included:
3> act upon the received _SystemInformationBlockType1_ as specified in
5.2.2.7;
2> if the _SystemInformationBlockType2_ is included:
3> act upon the received _SystemInformationBlockType2_ as specified in
5.2.2.9;
1> if the _rn-SubframeConfig_ is included:
2> reconfigure lower layers in accordance with the received
_subframeConfigPatternFDD_ or _subframeConfigPatternTDD_ ;
2> if the _rpdcch-Config_ is included:
> 3> reconfigure lower layers in accordance with the received _rpdcch-Config_

transmission, upon which the procedure ends;
# 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters (tabular & ASN.1)
## 6.1 General
The contents of each RRC message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to
specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further
detailed information about the information elements specified in the message
syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone
abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in sub-clause 6.3.
The need for information elements to be present in a message or an abstract
type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract
notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the
OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available
for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag is specified
in table 6.1-1.
Table 6.1-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for information
elements to be present
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Abbreviation | Meaning | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Cond _conditionTag_ | _Conditionally present_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | An information element for which the need | | | is specified by means of conditions. For | | | each _conditionTag_ , the need is | | | specified in a tabular form following the | | | ASN.1 segment. In case, according to the | | | conditions, a field is not present, the | | | UE takes no action and where applicable | | | shall continue to use the existing value | | | (and/ or the associated functionality) | | | unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g. | | | in the conditional presence table or in | | | the description of the field itself). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need OP | _Optionally present_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | An information element that is optional | | | to signal. For downlink messages, the UE | | | is not required to take any special | | | action on absence of the IE beyond what | | | is specified in the procedural text or | | | the field description table following the | | | ASN.1 segment. The UE behaviour on | | | absence should be captured either in the | | | procedural text or in the field | | | description. | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need ON | _Optionally present, No action_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | An information element that is optional | | | to signal. _If the message is received by | | | the UE, and_ in case the information | | | element is absent, the UE takes no action | | | and where applicable shall continue to | | | use the existing value (and/ or the | | | associated functionality). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | Need OR | _Optionally present, Release_ | | | | | (Used in downlink only) | An information element that is optional | | | to signal. _If the message is received by | | | the UE, and_ in case the information | | | element is absent, the UE shall | | | discontinue/ stop using/ delete any | | | existing value (and/ or the associated | | | functionality). | +-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
Any IE with Need ON in system information shall be interpreted as Need OR.
Need codes may not be specified for a parent extension field/ extension group,
used in downlink, which includes one or more child extension fields. Upon
absence of such a parent extension field/ extension group, the UE shall:
\- For each individual child extension field, including extensions that are
mandatory to include in the optional group, act in accordance with the need
code that is defined for the extension;
\- Apply this behaviour not only for child extension fields included directly
within the optional parent extension field/ extension group, but also for
extension fields defined at further nesting levels as long as for none of the
fields in-between the concerned extension field and the parent extension field
a need code is specified;
NOTE 1: The above applies for groups of non critical extensions using double
brackets (referred to as extension groups), as well as non-critical extensions
at the end of a message or at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING
or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).
Need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child)
field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is
present. This rule does not apply for optional parent extension fields/
extension groups without need codes,
NOTE 2: The previous rule implies that E-UTRAN has to include such a parent
extension field to release a child field that is either:
> \- Optional with need OR, or
>
> \- Conditional while the UE releases the child field when absent.
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by
means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE {
field11 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
field12 InformationElement12 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR

[[ field13 InformationElement13 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field14 InformationElement14 OPTIONAL -- Need ON
]]
}
InformationElement2 ::= SEQUENCE {
field21 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
\- if _field2_ in _RRCMessage-r8-IEs_ is absent, the UE does not modify
_field21_ ;
if _field2_ in _RRCMessage-r8-IEs_ is present but does not include _field21_ ,
the UE releases _field21_ ;
\- if the extension group containing _field13_ is absent, the UE releases
_field13_ and does not modify _field14_ ;
\- if _nonCriticalExtension_ defined by IE _RRCMessage-v8a0-IEs_ is absent,
the UE does not modify _field3_ and releases _field4_ ;

NOTE 1: During handover, the UE performs a MAC reset, which involves reverting
to the default CQI/ SRS/ SR configuration in accordance with subclause 5.3.13
and TS 36.321 [6, 5.9 & 5.2]. Hence, for these parts of the dedicated radio
resource configuration, the default configuration (rather than the
configuration used in the source PCell) is used as the basis for the delta
signalling that is included in the message used to perform handover.
NOTE 2: Since delta signalling is not supported for the common SCell
configuration, E-UTRAN can only add or release the uplink of an SCell by
releasing and adding the concerned SCell.
#### \-- _P-Max_
The IE _P-Max_ is used to limit the UE\'s uplink transmission power on a
carrier frequency and is used to calculate the parameter _Pcompensation_
defined in TS 36.304 [4]. Corresponds to parameter P~EMAX~ or P~EMAX,c~ in TS
36.101 [42]. The UE transmit power on one serving cell shall not exceed the
configured maximum UE output power of the serving cell determined by this
value as specified in TS 36.101 [42, 6.2.5 or 6.2.5A].

The encoding | | is defined in the specification of each RAT: | | | | For E‑UTRA: the encoding of UE capabilities is defined in IE | | _UE-EUTRA-Capability_. | | | | For UTRA: the octet string contains the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO | | message defined in TS 25.331 [19]. | | | | For GERAN CS: the octet string contains the concatenated string of | | the Mobile Station Classmark 2 and Mobile Station Classmark 3. The | | first 5 octets correspond to Mobile Station Classmark 2 and the | | following octets correspond to Mobile Station Classmark 3. The | | Mobile Station Classmark 2 is formatted as \'TLV\' and is coded in | | the same way as the _Mobile Station Classmark 2_ information element | | in TS 24.008 [49]. The first octet is the _Mobile station | | classmark 2 IEI_ and its value shall be set to 33H. The second octet | | is the _Length of mobile station classmark 2_ and its value shall be | | set to 3. The octet 3 contains the first octet of the value part of | | the _Mobile Station Classmark 2_ information element, the octet 4 | | contains the second octet of the value part of the _Mobile Station | | Classmark 2_ information element and so on. For each of these | | octets, the first/ leftmost/ most significant bit of the octet | | contains b8 of the corresponding octet of the Mobile Station | | Classmark 2. The Mobile Station Classmark 3 is formatted as \'V\' | | and is coded in the same way as the value part in the _Mobile | | station classmark 3_ information element in TS 24.008 [49]. The | | sixth octet of this octet string contains octet 1 of the value part | | of _Mobile station classmark 3_ , the seventh of octet of this octet | | string contains octet 2 of the value part of _Mobile station | | classmark 3_ and so on. Note. | | | | For GERAN PS: the encoding of UE capabilities is formatted as \'V\' | | and is coded in the same way as the value part in the _MS Radio | | Access Capability_ information element in TS 24.008 [49]. | | | | For CDMA2000-1XRTT: the octet string contains the A21 Mobile | | Subscription Information and the encoding of this is defined in | | A.S0008 [33]. The A21 Mobile Subscription Information contains the | | supported CDMA2000 1xRTT band class and band sub-class information. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
NOTE: The value part is specified by means of CSN.1, which encoding results in
a bit string, to which final padding may be appended up to the next octet
boundary TS 24.008 [49]. The first/ leftmost bit of the CSN.1 bit string is
placed in the first/ leftmost/ most significant bit of the first octet. This
continues until the last bit of the CSN.1 bit string, which is placed in the
last/ rightmost/ least significant bit of the last octet.
#### \-- _UE-EUTRA-Capability_
The IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability is used to convey the E-UTRA UE Radio Access
Capability Parameters, see TS 36.306 [5], and the Feature Group Indicators for
mandatory features (defined in Annexes B.1 and C.1) to the network._ _The IE
UE-EUTRA-Capability is transferred in E-UTRA or in another RAT._

NOTE 1: The IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ does not include AS security capability
information, since these are the same as the security capabilities that are
signalled by NAS. Consequently AS need not provide \"man-in-the-middle\"
protection for the security capabilities.
NOTE 2: The column FDD/ TDD diff indicates if the UE is allowed to signal, as
part of the additional capabilities for an XDD mode i.e. within _UE-EUTRA-
CapabilityAddXDD-Mode-xNM_ , a different value compared to the value signalled
elsewhere within _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ (i.e. the common value, supported for
both XDD modes). A \'-\' is used to indicate that it is not possible to signal
different values (used for fields for which the field description is provided
for other reasons).
NOTE 3: The _BandCombinationParameters for the same band combination can be
included more than once._
NOTE 4: UE CA and measurement capabilities indicate the combinations of
frequencies that can be configured as serving frequencies.

# 8 Protocol data unit abstract syntax
# 8.1 General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract
syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [13] and X.681
[14]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by
use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [15].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in
X.691:
\- When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to
15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the
leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value
shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.
NOTE: The terms \'leading bit\' and \'trailing bit\' are defined in ITU-T Rec.
X.680. When using the \'bstring\' notation, the leading bit of the bit string
value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the
right.
\- When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint
(\"CONTAINING\"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be
performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not
cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended
that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET
STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the
contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a
separate step.
\- When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a
Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents
Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are
extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU,
BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
## 8.2 Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/
across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs
(in case of PCCH, BCCH, CCCH or MCCH) upon transmission and reception as
follows:
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first
bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission,
the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC
SDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the
PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC
SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
## 8.3 Basic production
The \'basic production\' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract
syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains
a multiple of 8 bits.
## 8.4 Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall,
unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension
part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty
extensions;
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set
spare bits to zero;
## 8.5 Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer
shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of
8.

## 9.2 Default radio configurations
The following sections only list default values for REL-8 parameters included
in protocol version v8.5.0. For all fields introduced in a later protocol
version, the default value is \"released\" unless explicitly specified
otherwise. If UE is to apply default configuration while it is configured with
some critically extended fields, the UE shall apply the original version with
only default values. For the following fields, introduced in a protocol
version later than v8.5.0, the default corresponds with \"value not
applicable\":
\- _codeBookSubsetRestriction-v920_ ;
\- _pmi-RI-Report_ ;
NOTE 1: Value \"N/A\" indicates that the UE does not apply a specific value
(i.e. upon switching to a default configuration, E-UTRAN can not assume the UE
keeps the previously configured value). This implies that E-UTRAN needs to
configure a value before invoking the related functionality.
NOTE 2: In general, the signalling should preferably support a \"release\"
option for fields introduced after v8.5.0. The \"value not applicable\" should
be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields which value is relevant
only if another field is set to a value other than its default.

# 10 Radio information related interactions between network nodes
## 10.1 General
This section specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network
nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another
Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar
characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the E-UTRA
radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension
mechanisms apply.
## 10.2 Inter-node RRC messages
### 10.2.1 General
This section specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2- or the
S1-interface, either to or from the eNB, i.e. a single \'logical channel\' is
used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information
could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

## 10.5 Mandatory information in _AS-Config_
The _AS-Config_ transferred between source eNB and target-eNB shall include
all IEs necessary to describe the AS context. The conditional presence in
section 6 is only applicable for eNB to UE communication.
The \"need\" or \"cond\" statements are not applied in case of sending the IEs
from source eNB to target eNB. Some information elements shall be included
regardless of the \"need\" or \"cond\" e.g. _discardTimer_. The _AS-Config_
re-uses information elements primarily created to cover the radio interface
signalling requirements. The information elements may include some parameters
that are not relevant for the target eNB e.g. the SFN as included in the
_MasterInformationBlock_.
All the fields in the _AS-Config_ as defined in 10.3 that are introduced after
v9.2.0 and that are optional for eNB to UE communication shall be included, if
the functionality is configured. The fields in the _AS-Config_ that are
defined before and including v9.2.0 shall be included as specified in the
following.
Within the _sourceRadioResourceConfig,_ _sourceMeasConfig_ and
_sourceOtherConfig_ , the source eNB shall include fields that are optional
for eNB to UE communication, if the functionality is configured unless
explicitly specified otherwise in the following:
\- in accordance with a condition that is explicitly stated to be applicable;
or
\- a default value is defined for the concerned field; and the configured
value is the same as the default value that is defined; or
\- the need of the field is OP and the current UE configuration corresponds
with the behaviour defined for absence of the field;
The following fields, if the functionality is configured, are not mandatory
for the source eNB to include in the _AS-Config_ since delta signalling by the
target eNB for these fields is not supported:
\- _semiPersistSchedC-RNTI_
\- _measGapConfig_
For the measurement configuration, a corresponding operation as 5.5.6.1 and
5.5.2.2a is executed by target eNB.
# 11 UE capability related constraints and performance requirements
## 11.1 UE capability related constraints
The following table lists constraints regarding the UE capabilities that
E-UTRAN is assumed to take into account.
* * *
Parameter Description Value #DRBs The number of DRBs that a UE shall support 8
#RLC-AM The number of RLC AM entities that a UE shall support 10
#minCellperMeasObjectEUTRA The minimum number of neighbour cells (excluding
black list cells) that a UE shall be able to store within a MeasObjectEUTRA.
NOTE. 32 #minBlackCellRangesperMeasObjectEUTRA The minimum number of blacklist
cell PCI ranges that a UE shall be able to store within a MeasObjectEUTRA 32
#minCellperMeasObjectUTRA The minimum number of neighbour cells that a UE
shall be able to store within a MeasObjectUTRA. NOTE. 32
#minCellperMeasObjectGERAN The minimum number of neighbour cells that a UE
shall be able to store within a measObjectGERAN. NOTE. 32
#minCellperMeasObjectCDMA2000 The minimum number of neighbour cells that a UE
shall be able to store within a measObjectCDMA2000. NOTE. 32 #minCellTotal The
minimum number of neighbour cells (excluding black list cells) that UE shall
be able to store in total in all measurement objects configured 256 NOTE: In
case of CGI reporting, the limit regarding the cells E-UTRAN can configure
includes the cell for which the UE is requested to report CGI i.e. the amount
of neighbour cells that can be included is at most (# minCellperMeasObjectRAT
- 1), where RAT represents EUTRA/UTRA/GERAN/CDMA2000 respectively.
* * *
## 11.2 Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the
following table, by means of a value N:
N = the number of 1ms subframes from the end of reception of the E-UTRAN -> UE
message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the
reception of uplink grant for the UE -> E-UTRAN response message with no
access delay other than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by
scheduling, the random access procedure or physical layer synchronisation).
NOTE: No processing delay requirements are specified for RN-specific
procedures.

## 11.3 Void
###### ## Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
Editor\'s note No agreements have been reached concerning the extension of RRC
PDUs so far. Any statements in this section about the protocol extension
mechanism should be considered as FFS.
## A.1 Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol
data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
## A.2 Procedural specification
### A.2.1 General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception
of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU
specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details
of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be
done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU section e.g.
general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple
fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements
regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are send to E-UTRAN
i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
### A.2.2 More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
\- Bullets:
\- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are
part of the sentence starting with \'The UE shall:\'
\- All bullets, including the last one in a sub-clause, should end with a
semi-colon i.e. an \';\'
\- Conditions
\- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end
of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in \'if cond1;
or cond2:
## A.3 PDU specification
### A.3.1 General principles
#### A.3.1.1 ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract
syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the
specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1
code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with a text paragraph
consisting entirely of an _ASN.1 start tag_ , which consists of a double
hyphen followed by a single space and the text string \"ASN1START\" (in all
upper case letters). Each ASN.1 section ends with a text paragraph consisting
entirely of an _ASN.1 stop tag_ , which consists of a double hyphen followed
by a single space and the text \"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters):
\-- ASN1START
\-- ASN1STOP
The text paragraphs containing the ASN.1 start and stop tags should not
contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU
contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text
paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the
order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE: A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists
of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the
entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed
by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the
occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
#### A.3.1.2 ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should
be based on the following guidelines:
\- Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without
hyphenation. These identifiers, _e.g._ , the
_RRCConnectionModificationCommand_ , should be used for reference in the
procedure text. Abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
\- Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case,
with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a
capital, _e.g._ , _EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since
the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-
TimeDifference_.
\- Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case
thereafter, _e.g._ , _establishmentCause_. If a field identifier begins with
an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is
lowercase (_plmn-Identity_ , not _pLMN-Identity_). The acronym is set off with
a hyphen (_ue-Identity_ , not _ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a
consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers_.
\- Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially
widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent
possible.
\- Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should
be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which
should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use \'Meas\' instead of
\'Measurement\' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are
given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
\- _For future extension:_ When an extension is introduced a suffix is added
to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/ or type. A suffix of the
form \"‑rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types
introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/ first
release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a
revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, _e.g._
, _Foo-r9_ for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type _Foo_. A suffix of the form
\"‑vXYZ\" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a
corresponding earlier field or type (see sub-clause A.4), e.g.,
_AnElement-v10b0_ for the extension of the ASN.1 type _AnElement_ introduced
in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number _0...9, 10, 11, etc._ is
used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release
of the protocol. Lower case letters _a, b, c, etc._ are used to represent the
second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In
the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings
suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the
extension from the original field.
\- More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants
of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the
identifiers e.g. _MeasObjectUTRA_ , _ConfigCommon_. When there is no
particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included
in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be
attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the
different variants.
Table A.3.1.2-1: Examples of typical abbreviations used in ASN.1 identifiers
* * *
**Abbreviation** **Abbreviated word** Conf Confirmation Config Configuration
DL Downlink Ext Extension Freq Frequency Id Identity Ind Indication Info
Information Meas Measurement Neigh Neighbour(ing) Param(s) Parameter(s)
Persist Persistent Phys Physical Proc Process Reestab Reestablishment Req
Request Sched Scheduling Thresh Threshold Transm Transmission UL Uplink
* * *
NOTE: The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be
used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
#### A.3.1.3 Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the
specification is made using the ASN.1 field or type identifier of the
referenced element. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text
references should be in the _italic font style_. The \"do not check spelling
and grammar\" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., \" \")
should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU type should be made using the corresponding ASN.1
type identifier followed by the word \"message\", e.g., a reference to the
_RRCConnectionRelease_ message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any
other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"field\", e.g., a reference to the
_prioritisedBitRate_ field in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority Priority,
prioritisedBitRate PrioritisedBitRate,
bucketSizeDuration BucketSizeDuration,
logicalChannelGroup INTEGER (0..3)
} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
NOTE: All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this
annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to
include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted
from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym \"IE\", e.g., a
reference to the IE _LogicalChannelConfig_ in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when
those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the
specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a
particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information
element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be
used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1
value, e.g., \'if the _status_ field is set to value _true_ \'.
### A.3.2 High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are
alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
message DL-DCCH-MessageType
}
DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE {
dlInformationTransfer DLInformationTransfer,
handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
mobilityFromEUTRACommand MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
rrcConnectionReconfiguration RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
rrcConnectionRelease RRCConnectionRelease,
securityModeCommand SecurityModeCommand,
ueCapabilityEnquiry UECapabilityEnquiry,
spare1 NULL
},
messageClassExtension SEQUENCE {}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types
are alternatives within the inner level _c1_ CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare1_ in this case) may be included within the
_c1_ CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare
alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an
integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using
the _messageClassExtension_ alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
### A.3.3 Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one
shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8 RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here.
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Hooks for _critical_ and _non-critical_ extension should normally be included
in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described
in sub-clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents
and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between
the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented
from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not
comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE
structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the
inner level _c1_ CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare3_ down to _spare1_
in this case) may be included within the _c1_ CHOICE. The number of spare
alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be
decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the
future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original
specifications are used up, is facilitated using the
_criticalExtensionsFuture_ in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases
of the protocol, the inner level _c1_ CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be
excluded, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here. -- -- Cond condTag
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information
to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-
critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still
able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or
other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are
facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"...\". The original
specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at
the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field
that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of an empty
sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
_The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a
field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic
properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is
shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case
there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g.
because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for
each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that
needs to be specified._
+-------------------------------------------+ | _%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions_ | +-------------------------------------------+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+
The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the
ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall
include a first paragraph with a _field identifier_ (in **_bold and italic_**
font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The
following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style),
e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/ or
specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of
the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be
omitted from the field description table.
### A.3.4 Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to
the one shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-ConfigSIB ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo
}
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need ON
}
PRACH-ConfigInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
prach-ConfigIndex ENUMERATED {ffs},
highSpeedFlag ENUMERATED {ffs},
zeroCorrelationZoneConfig ENUMERATED {ffs}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same
set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break
down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs _PRACH-ConfigSIB_
and _PRACH-Config_ in this example, are preferably placed together in a common
ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base,
defined as the _generic type identifier_. It may be complemented by a suffix
to distinguish the different variants. The \"_PRACH-Config_ \" is the generic
type identifier in this example, and the \"_SIB_ \" suffix is added to
distinguish the variant. The sub-clause heading and generic references to a
group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type
identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of
an existing IE is created for _critical_ or _non-critical_ extension of the
protocol (see sub-clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of
the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix
is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in sub-
clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new
version, or extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ in the example
above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE
types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types
should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type
definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a
benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these
IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data
elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ , should
not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification.
An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be
defined in a separate sub-clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1
section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs
_PRACH-ConfigSIB_ and _PRACH-Config_ in the example above). Such IE types are
also referred to as \'global IEs\'.
NOTE: Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the
context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation
error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE
type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline
level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the
example above, may be followed by a _field description_ table, where a further
description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information
elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in
sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of
the _field description_ table is the same as shown in sub-clause A.3.3 for the
specification of the PDU type.
### A.3.5 Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It
identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a
value for that field in the encoding:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PreambleInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
numberOfRA-Preambles INTEGER (1..64) DEFAULT 1,
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword
OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission
carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need ON
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted,
should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword
OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need statement. The need statement
includes the keyword \"Need\", followed by one of the predefined semantics
tags (OP, ON or OR) defined in sub-clause 6.1. If the semantics tag OP is
used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the
field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
### A.3.6 Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In
addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph
including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword
\"Cond\", followed by a condition tag associated with the field (\"UL\" in
this example):
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority INTEGER (0),
...
} OPTIONAL -- Cond UL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field
description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a _conditional
presence_ table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for
including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1
section.
* * *
_Conditional presence_ _Explanation_ UL **Specification of the conditions for
including the field associated with the condition tag = \"UL\". Semantics in
case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.**
* * *
The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading:
\"Conditional presence\") contains the condition tag (in _italic_ font style),
which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry
in the table. The second column (heading: \"Explanation\") contains a text
specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the
field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional
presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined
tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field
despends on the presence and/ or value of other fields within the same
message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another feature/
function has been configured, while this function can be configured
indepedently e.g. by another message and/ or at another point in time, the
relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the field description
table.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence,
the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of
conditional presence should be considered.
### A.3.7 Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct
in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an
information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would
not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in
the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo
PLMN-IdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code
to contain types with unpredictable names:
\-- /bad example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
## A.4 Extension of the PDU specifications
### A.4.1 General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect
interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different
versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this
requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
\- Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected
behaviour or damage).
\- Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be
possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of
the other parts of the message).
\- Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used,
the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical
channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may
be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring
of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing
protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when
there is a need to introduce a \'clean\' message version. Such a need appears
when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical
extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with
the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered
when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical
extension mechanisms.
### A.4.2 Critical extension of messages
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are
both \"outer branch\" and \"inner branch\" mechanisms available. The \"outer
branch\" consists of a CHOICE having the name _criticalExtensions_ , with two
values, _c1_ and _criticalExtensionsFuture_. The _criticalExtensionsFuture_
branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the \"inner
branch\" mechanism.
The \"inner branch\" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form
\"_MessageName-rX-IEs_ \" (e.g., \"_RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs_ \")
or \"_spareX_ \", with the spare values having type NULL. The \"-rX-IEs\"
structures contain the _complete_ structure of the message IEs for the
appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10
version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not
obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional
Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to
introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an \'outer branch\', or an
\'outer branch\' in combination with an \'inner branch\' including a certain
number of spares:
\- For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on
a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
\- An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
\- The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that
the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release
with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values).
The estimation of the critical extension likelyhood may be based on the
number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
\- In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all
spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions
are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism
by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Later release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {

rrcMessage-r10 RRCMessage-r10-IEs,
rrcMessage-r11 RRCMessage-r11-IEs,

},

rrcMessage-r16 RRCMessage-r16-IEs,
spare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
### A.4.3 Non-critical extension of messages
#### A.4.3.1 General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in
A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional
guidelines apply:
\- When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been
critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier
critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
\- The extension marker (\"...\") is the primary non-critical extension
mechanism that is used unless a length determinant is not required. Examples
of cases where a length determinant is not required:
\- at the end of a message,
\- at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING
\- When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are
preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter
belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the \'_default
extension location_ \')
\- It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of
the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible
level.
\- In specific cases it may be preferrable to place extensions elsewhere
(referred to as the \'_actual extension location_ \') e.g. when it is possible
to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should
be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message. \
\- In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier
critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher
level in the message should be considered.
\- In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE
should be defined. The IE\'s ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same
ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are
intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location,
an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily
introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not
allways be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the
actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 section. \
#### A.4.3.2 Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous section, the
following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
\- Extension markers within SEQUENCE
\- Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the
higher nesting levels
\- Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields
as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex
structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list)
\- Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important
information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT
\- Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages
on BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully
\- The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the
specification are grouped together using double brackets.
\- Extension markers within ENUMERATED
\- Spare values are used until the number of values reaches the next power of
2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new value,
e.g. \"value-vXYZ\".
\- Extension markers within CHOICE:
\- Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when
comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for
the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g.
ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the
behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not
required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the
extended value.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new choice
value, e.g. \"choice-vXYZ\".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an
OCTET or BIT STRING:
\- When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a \"Need\" statement should
not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one
extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For
simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a \"Need\" statement when the
field is not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
\- In case a need statement is not provided for a group, a \"Need\" statement
is provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e.
including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify
the action upon absence of the whole group.
#### A.4.3.3 Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number
of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also
illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism
is used.
NOTE In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while
the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n
receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced
mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 ENUMERATED {
value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,
..., value5-v960 },
field2 CHOICE {
field2a BOOLEAN,
field2b InformationElement2b,
...,
field2c-v960 InformationElement2c-r9
},
...,
[[ field3-r9 InformationElement3-r9 OPTIONAL -- Need OR
]],
[[ field3-v9a0 InformationElement3-v9a0 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field4-r9 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL -- Need OR
]]
}
InformationElement1-r10 ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 ENUMERATED {
value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,
value5-v960, value6-v1170, spare2, spare1, ... },
field2 CHOICE {
field2a BOOLEAN,
field2b InformationElement2b,
field2c-v960 InformationElement2c-r9,
...,
field2d-v12b0 INTEGER (0..63)
},
field3-r9 InformationElement3-r10 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field4-r9 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
field5-r10 BOOLEAN,
field6-r10 InformationElement6-r10 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
...,
[[ field3-v1170 InformationElement3-v1170 OPTIONAL -- Need OR
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions of _InformationElement1_ as shown in the
above example:
\-- The _InformationElement1_ is initially extended with a number of non-
critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced
for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE
_InformationElement1_ (i.e. _InformationElement1-r10_) is defined in which the
earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the
original field.
\-- The _value4-v880_ is replacing a spare value defined in the original
protocol version for _field1_. Likewise _value6-v1170_ replaces _spare3_ that
was originally defined in the r10 version of _field1_
\-- Within the critically extended release 10 version of _InformationElement1_
, the names of the original fields/ IEs are not changed, unless there is a
real need to distinguish them from other fields/ IEs. E.g. the _field1_ and
_InformationElement4_ were defined in the original protocol version (release
8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the _field3-r9_ is introduced in release 9
and not re-tagged; although, the _InformationElement3_ is also critically
extended and therefore tagged _InformationElement3-r10_ in the release 10
version of InformationElement1.
#### A.4.3.4 Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a
message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the
end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or
OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v860-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v860-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4-v860 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need OP
field5-v860 BOOLEAN OPTIONAL, -- Cond C54
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field6-v940 InformationElement6-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need OR
nonCriticalExtensions SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The _InformationElement4_ is introduced in the original version of the
protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
#### A.4.3.5 Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default
extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case
an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
#### \-- _ParentIE-WithEM_
The IE _ParentIE-WithEM_ is an example of a high level IE including the
extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level
IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ which not include the
extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have
to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0_
and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0_ (both in release N) are used to connect non-
critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs
to the actual extension location in this IE.
_ParentIE-WithEM information element_
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ParentIE-WithEM ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Root encoding, including:
childIE1-WithoutEM ChildIE1-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
childIE2-WithoutEM ChildIE2-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
...,
[[ childIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL, -- Need ON
childIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL -- Need ON
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The fields _childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0_ may not really need to be optional
(depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
\-- In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields
should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.
#### \-- _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, used to control
certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be
setup or released using the local IE _ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature_. The example
illustrates how the new field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the
configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the
following assumptions:
\-- when initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the
original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as
if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
\-- when the configurable feature is released, the new field should be
released also.
\-- when omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE
continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling
for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
\-- when omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases
the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may
be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an
eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may
not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.
_ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ information elements

## A.5 Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC
messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a
Transaction identifier
1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC
transaction identifier.
2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC
transaction identifier.
3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC
Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an
RRC transaction identifier.
5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a
corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction
identifier.
## A.6 Protection of RRC messages (informative)
The following list provides information which messages can be sent
(unprotected) prior to security activation and which messages can be sent
unprotected after security activation. Those messages indicated \"-\" in \"P\"
column should never be sent unprotected by eNB or UE. Further requirements are
defined in the procedural text.
P...Messages that can be sent (unprotected) prior to security activation
A - I...Messages that can be sent without integrity protection after security
activation
A - C...Messages that can be sent unciphered after security activation
NA... Message can never be sent after security activation

###### ## Annex B (normative): Release 8 and 9 AS feature handling
## B.1 Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in fields
_featureGroupIndicators_ (in Table B.1-1) and _featureGroupIndRel9Add_ (in
Table B.1-1a).
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the fields
_featureGroupIndicators_ in the IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ and
_featureGroupIndRel9Add_ in the IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability-v9a0_. All the
functionalities defined within the field _featureGroupIndicators_ defined in
Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a are mandatory for the UE, if the related
capability (frequency band, RAT, SR-VCC or Inter-RAT ANR) is also supported.
For a specific indicator, if all functionalities for a feature group listed in
Table B.1-1 have been implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator
as one (1), else (i.e. if any one of the functionalities in a feature group
listed in Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a, which have not been implemented or
tested), the UE shall set the indicator as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators that correspond to RATs not supported by the
UE as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in Table B.1-1
or Table B.1-1a, as zero (0).
If the optional fields _featureGroupIndicators_ or _featureGroupIndRel9Add_
are not included by a UE of a future release, the network may assume that all
features pertaining to the RATs supported by the UE, respectively listed in
Table B.1-1 or Table B.1-1a and deployed in the network, have been implemented
and tested by the UE.
In Table B.1-1, a \'VoLTE capable UE\' corresponds to a UE which is IMS voice
capable.
The indexing in Table B.1-1a starts from index 33, which is the leftmost bit
in the field _featureGroupIndRel9Add_.

**Clarification for mobility from EUTRAN and inter-frequency handover within
EUTRAN**
There are several feature groups related to mobility from E-UTRAN and inter-
frequency handover within EUTRAN. The description of these features is based
on the assumption that we have 5 main \"functions\" related to mobility from
E-UTRAN:
A. Support of measurements and cell reselection procedure in idle mode
B. Support of RRC release with redirection procedure in connected mode
C. Support of Network Assisted Cell Change in connected mode
D. Support of measurements and reporting in connected mode
E. Support of handover procedure in connected mode
All functions can be applied for mobility to Inter-frequency to EUTRAN, GERAN,
UTRAN, CDMA2000 HRPD and CDMA2000 1xRTT except for function C) which is only
applicable for mobility to GERAN. Table B.1-2 below summarises the mobility
functions that are supported based on the UE capability signaling (band
support) and the setting of the feature group support indicators.

In case measurements and reporting function is not supported by UE, the
network may still issue the mobility procedures redirection (B) and CCO (C) in
a blind fashion.
## B.2 CSG support
In this release of the protocol, it is mandatory for the UE to support a
minimum set of CSG functionality consisting of:
\- Identifying whether a cell is CSG or not;
\- Ignoring CSG cells in cell selection/reselection.
Additional CSG functionality in AS, i.e. the requirement to detect and camp on
CSG cells when the \"CSG whitelist\" is available or when manual CSG selection
is triggered by the user, are related to the corresponding NAS features. This
additional AS functionality consists of:
\- Manual CSG selection;
\- Autonomous CSG search;
\- Implicit priority handling for cell reselection with CSG cells.
It is possible that this additional CSG functionality in AS is not supported
or tested in early UE implementations.
Note that since the above AS features relate to idle mode operations, the
capability support is not signalled to the network. For these reasons, no
\"feature group indicator\" is assigned to this feature to indicate early
support in Rel-8.
###### ## Annex C (normative): Release 10 AS feature handling
## C.1 Feature group indicators
This annex contains the definitions of the bits in field
_featureGroupIndRel10_.
In this release of the protocol, the UE shall include the field
_featureGroupIndRel10_ in the IE _UE-EUTRA-Capability-v1020-IEs_. All the
functionalities defined within the field _featureGroupIndRel10_ defined in
Table C.1-1 are mandatory for the UE, if the related capability (spatial
multiplexing in UL, PDSCH transmission mode 9, carrier aggregation, handover
to EUTRA, or RAT) is also supported. For a specific indicator, if all
functionalities for a feature group listed in Table C.1-1 have been
implemented and tested, the UE shall set the indicator as one (1), else (i.e.
if any one of the functionalities in a feature group listed in Table C.1-1
have not been implemented or tested), the UE shall set the indicator as zero
(0).
The UE shall set all indicators that correspond to RATs not supported by the
UE as zero (0).
The UE shall set all indicators, which do not have a definition in Table
C.1-1, as zero (0).
If the optional field _featureGroupIndRel10_ is not included by a UE of a
future release, the network may assume that all features, listed in Table
C.1-1 and deployed in the network, have been implemented and tested by the UE.
The indexing in Table C.1-1 starts from index 101, which is the leftmost bit
in the field _featureGroupIndRel10_.

###### ## Annex D (informative): Descriptive background information
## D.1 Signalling of Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (Multiple FBI)
### D.1.1 Mapping between frequency band indicator and multiple frequency band
indicator
This subclause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator
(MFBI) lists and the E-UTRA frequency bands in _SystemInformationBlockType1_
by means of an example as shown in Figure D.1.1-1. In this example:
\- E-UTRAN cell belongs to band B90 and also bands B6, B7, B91, and B92.
\- E-UTRAN uses B64 to indicate the presence of B90 in
_freqBandIndciator-v9e0_.
\- For the MFBI list of this cell, E-UTRAN uses B64 in _MultiBAndInfoList_ to
indicate the position and priority of the bands in _MultiBandInfoList-v9e0_.
\- The UE, after reading _SystemInformationBlockType1_ , generates an MFBI
list with priority of B91, B6, B92, and B7. The UE applies the first listed
band which it supports _._

### D.1.2 Mapping between inter-frequency neighbour list and multiple
frequency band indicator
This subclause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator
(MFBI) lists and the E-UTRA frequencies signalled in
_SystemInformationBlockType5_ by means of an example as shown in Figure
D.1.2-1. In this example:
\- E-UTRAN includes 4 frequencies: the bands associated with f1 and f4 belong
to bands lower than 64; the bands associated with f2 and f3 belong to bands
larger than 64. The reserved EARFCN value of 65535 is used to indicate the
presence of _ARFCN-ValueEUTRA-v9e0_.
\- The band associated with f1 has two overlapping bands, B1 and B2 (lower
than 64); the band associated with f2 has one overlapping band, B91; the bands
associated with f3 has four overlapping bands B3, B4, B92, and B93; the band
associated with f4 does not have overlapping bands.
\- E-UTRAN includes 4 lists in both _interFreqCarrierFreqList-v8h0_ and
_interFreqCarrierFreqList-v9e0_ and ensure the order of the lists is matching.
Each list corresponds to one EARFCN and contains up to 8 bands. The first list
corresponds to f1, the second list corresponds to f2, and so on. The grey
lists mean not including _MultiBandInfoList_ or _MultiBandInfoList-v9e0_ ,
i.e. the corresponding EARFCN does not have any overlapping frequency bands in
_MultiBandInfoList_ or _MultiBandInfoList-v9e0_.

### D.1.3 Mapping between UTRA FDD frequency list and multiple frequency band
indicator
This subclause describes the use of the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator
(MFBI) lists and the UTRA FDD frequencies signalled in
_SystemInformationBlockType6_ by means of an example as shown in Figure
D.1.3-1. In this example:
\- E-UTRA includes 4 UTRAN FDD frequencies.
\- The bands associated with f1 and f4 have no overlapping bands. The band
associated f2 has two overlapping bands, B1 and B2. The band associated with
f3 has one overlapping band, B3.
\- E-UTRA include 4 lists in _carrierFreqListUTRA-FDD-v8h0_ with the first and
fourth entry not including _MultiBandInfoList_.
