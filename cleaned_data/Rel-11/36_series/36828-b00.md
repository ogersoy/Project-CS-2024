# Introduction
TDD offers flexible deployments without requiring a pair of spectrum
resources. For TDD deployments in general, interference between UL and DL
including both basestation-to-basestation and UE-to-UE interference needs to
be considered. One example includes layered heterogeneous network deployments,
where it may be of interest to consider different uplink-downlink
configurations in different cells. Also of interest are deployments involving
different carriers deployed by different operators in the same band and
employing either the same or different uplink-downlink configurations, where
possible interference may include adjacent channel interference as well as co-
channel interference such as remote basestation-to-basestation interference.
Currently, LTE TDD allows for asymmetric UL-DL allocations by providing seven
different semi-statically configured uplink-downlink configurations. These
allocations can provide between 40% and 90% DL subframes. The semi-static
allocation may or may not match the instantaneous traffic situation. The
current mechanism for adapting UL-DL allocation is based on the system
information change procedure. Additional mechanisms could include e.g. dynamic
allocation of subframes to UL or DL.

# 4 Objectives of study
Objectives of the study item include:
For the isolated cell scenario, i.e. without co-channel interference:
  * RAN1 should evaluate the benefits of uplink-downlink > re-configuration dependent upon traffic conditions.
    * Identify the proper simulation assumptions, including traffic > models.
    * Assess the appropriate time scale for uplink-downlink > re-configuration.
    * Assess the benefits at least in terms of performance and energy > saving.
  * RAN4 should perform coexistence analysis with multiple operator > deployments in adjacent channels.
For the multi-cell scenario, i.e. with co-channel interference:
  * RAN1 should evaluate the benefits of uplink-downlink > re-configuration dependent upon traffic conditions.
    * Identify the proper simulation assumptions, including traffic > models.
    * Assess the appropriate time scale for uplink-downlink > re-configuration.
    * Assess the benefits at least in terms of performance and energy > saving.
  * RAN1 and RAN4 should identify the multi-cell scenarios for which TDD > DL-UL interference may arise and additional TDD DL-UL interference > mitigation would be beneficial.
    * Deployments comprising the same or different uplink-downlink > configurations should be investigated.
  * RAN4 should perform co-existence analysis for the above identified > scenarios, including co-channel and adjacent channel interference, > where adjacent channel interference may be from other operator(s).
  * For all the studies above, deployment scenarios should include > regular homogeneous macro deployments and layered heterogeneous > deployments.
For both isolated cell scenario and multi-cell scenario:
  * If significant benefits are identified by RAN1 evaluations, RAN1 > should identify potential air interface solutions, including > necessary EUTRAN/UE measurements, to mitigate DL-UL interference, > taking into account the RAN4 co-existence analysis.
  * Backward compatibility of Rel-8/9/10 terminals should be maintained.
  * Specification impact should be identified and assessed.
# 5 Feasibility study
## 5.1 Methodologies
The following two approaches are used for the feasibility study.
  * Approach 1: Deterministic calculations mainly for BS-BS interference case
    * Obtain the minimum required site separation distance in certain scenarios when different TDD configurations are applied in neighbouring cells.
    * 0.8dB de-sensitivity criteria is applied for negligible interference level for BS.
  * Approach 2: Monte Carlo simulations for both BS-BS and UE-UE interference case
    * Obtain the DL/UL geometry and/or throughput to see the performance loss due to different TDD configurations in the network based on the agreed simulation assumptions.
For approach 2, the difference of the DL/UL geometry with and without
different TDD configurations and the absolute DL/UL geometry with different
TDD configurations are used as criteria to evaluate the feasibility of
applying different TDD configurations in different cells. Further studies of
the criteria are not precluded. It is noted that the feasibility study in this
section assumes full buffer traffic model.
## 5.2 Scenario 1
This scenario assumes multiple Femto cells deployed on the same carrier
frequency. The simulation assumptions are included in Annex A.

## 5\. 10 Summary
Based on the co-existence evaluations for the eight scenarios, following
conclusions are made:
  * Significant BS-BS co-existence challenges have been observed to apply different TDD UL-DL configurations in different cells for scenarios 1-4 without any interference mitigation mechanisms.
  * It is feasible to apply different TDD UL-DL configurations in different cells for scenarios 1 -- 4, only provided sufficient interference mitigation mechanisms are adopted. The interference mitigation schemes need further study.
  * Significant BS-BS coexistence challenges have been observed when different TDD UL-DL configurations are applied in different cells for scenarios 5-8 without any interference mitigation schemes. Preliminary results with interference mitigation mechanisms were submitted but it has not been discussed. No conclusion on coexistence feasibility with interference mitigation mechanisms has been made.
# 6 Performance evaluation
## 6.1 Methodologies
To evaluate the benefits of TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic
adaptation at least in terms of performance and energy saving, the following
metrics can be used:
  * Packet throughput, defined as the packet size over the packet transmission time, including the packet waiting time in the buffer
  * UE average packet throughput, defined as the average of packet throughput for the UE
  * {5%, 50%, 95%} UE average packet throughput, from the CDF of average packet throughput from all UEs
  * Cell average packet throughput, defined as the mean of average packet throughput from all UEs
  * Other metrics, e.g.
    * Packet drop statistics
    * Packet delay statistics
    * Frequency resource (PRBs) utilizations
    * Time resource (subframes) utilizations
    * CDF of packet throughput
    * Total number of configured DL/UL subframes
The gain of TDD UL-DL reconfiguration is assessed by comparing its performance
relative to a fixed reference TDD UL-DL configuration, where the gain is
evaluated over different fixed reference TDD UL-DL configurations and
different downlink/uplink traffic loads. Downlink and uplink transmissions are
evaluated in an integrated simulator, with metrics collected separately for
downlink and uplink. Different time scales for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration are
also evaluated to show its impact on the performance.
## 6.2 Scenario 1: Isolated pico cell
This section captures the simulation assumptions and evaluation results for
the isolated pico cell scenario. The evaluation assumptions are shown in Table

### 6.4.1 Evaluation results without interference mitigation
Tables 6.4.1-1 to 6.4.1-4 show the evaluation results of co-channel multi-cell
macro-pico scenario for different fixed reference TDD UL-DL configurations and
different downlink/uplink traffic loads, without interference mitigation. The
values are relative gain or loss of TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic
adaptation compared to the fixed reference TDD UL-DL configuration.
Table 6.4.1-1a collects the metrics separately for pico and macro, and Table
6.4.1-1b collects the metrics jointly for pico and macro.

### 6.4.2 Evaluation results with interference mitigation
Tables 6.4.2-1 to 6.4.2-2 show the evaluation results of co-channel multi-cell
macro-pico scenario for different fixed reference TDD UL-DL configurations and
different downlink/uplink traffic loads, with interference mitigation. The
values are relative gain or loss of TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic
adaptation compared to the fixed reference TDD UL-DL configuration.
Table 6.4.2-1a collects the metrics separately for pico and macro, and Table
6.4.2-1b collects the metrics jointly for pico and macro.

## 6.5 Scenario 4: Adjacent-channel multi-cell macro-pico scenario
This section captures the simulation assumptions and evaluation results for
the adjacent-channel multi-cell macro-pico scenario. The evaluation
assumptions are the same as in Table 6.4-1, with the additional assumptions
shown in Table 6.5-1.
Table 6.5-1: Additional evaluation assumptions for adjacent-channel multi-cell
macro pico scenario

Parameters Assumptions ACIR BS-BS 43dB ACIR BS-UE 33dB ACIR UE-BS 30dB ACIR
UE-UE 28dB
* * *
Tables 6.5-1 to 6.5-5 show the evaluation results of adjacent-channel multi-
cell macro-pico scenario for different fixed reference TDD UL-DL
configurations and different downlink/uplink traffic loads, without
interference mitigation. The values are relative gain or loss of TDD UL-DL
reconfiguration based on traffic adaptation compared to the fixed reference
TDD UL-DL configuration.

## 6.6 Summary
For the evaluated isolated pico cell scenario (i.e. scenario 1), TDD UL-DL
reconfiguration based on traffic condition provides benefits over a fixed
reference TDD UL-DL configuration.
  * The benefits at least include improved packet throughput
  * The benefits may be observed in either DL or UL or both directions,
    * The less number of DL (or UL) subframes in the fixed reference TDD UL-DL configuration, the higher DL (or UL) packet throughput gain (if any) achieved by TDD UL-DL reconfiguration
  * The benefits are mainly observed in low to medium cell traffic load region
  * Faster TDD UL-DL reconfiguration provides larger benefits than slower TDD UL-DL reconfiguration
    * The gain of faster TDD UL-DL reconfiguration over slower TDD UL-DL reconfiguration reduces with the increase of cell traffic load and/or packet size
For the evaluated multi-pico cell scenario (i.e. scenario 2), TDD UL-DL
reconfiguration based on traffic conditions without interference mitigation
provides benefits over a fixed reference TDD UL-DL configuration.
  * The benefits at least include improved average packet throughput in the low cell traffic load region
  * The benefits may be observed in either DL or UL or both directions,
    * The less number of DL (or UL) subframes in the fixed reference TDD UL-DL configuration, the higher DL (or UL) packet throughput gain (if any) achieved by TDD UL-DL reconfiguration
  * Faster TDD UL-DL reconfiguration provides larger benefits on average packet throughput than slower TDD UL-DL reconfiguration
    * The gain of faster TDD UL-DL reconfiguration over slower TDD UL-DL reconfiguration reduces with the increase of cell traffic load and/or packet size
  * The 5% UE average packet throughput may be increased or decreased.
For the evaluated multi-pico cell scenario (i.e. scenario 2), with
interference mitigation, TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic conditions
provides higher packet throughput in UL than without interference mitigation.
Meanwhile, depending on the interference mitigation scheme and cell traffic
load, TDD UL-DL reconfiguration with interference mitigation may provide
higher or lower packet throughput in DL than without interference mitigation,
and for the latter case, the increase in UL packet throughput can be higher
than the loss in DL packet throughput.
For the evaluated co-channel multi-macro/pico cell scenario (i.e. scenario 3),
the following observations are made for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on
traffic conditions without interference mitigation compared to a fixed TDD UL-
DL configuration:
  * Improved or reduced DL packet throughput for pico cells;
  * Similar DL packet throughput for macro cells;
  * Significantly decreased UL packet throughput for both macro and pico cells.
For the evaluated co-channel multi-macro/pico cell scenario (i.e. scenario 3),
the following observations are made for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on
traffic conditions with interference mitigation compared to without
interference mitigation:
  * Improved UL packet throughput for both macro and pico cells;
  * Similar DL packet throughput for macro cells;
  * Improved or decreased DL packet throughput for pico cells depending on the interference mitigation scheme.
For the evaluated co-channel multi-macro/pico cell scenario (i.e. scenario 3),
the following observations are made for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on
traffic conditions with interference mitigation compared to a fixed TDD UL-DL
configuration:
  * Reduced UL packet throughput for macro cells;
  * Improved or decreased UL packet throughput for pico cells, partly depending on the interference mitigation scheme.
For the evaluated adjacent channel multi-macro/pico cell scenario (i.e.
scenario 4), the following observations are made for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration
based on traffic conditions without interference mitigation compared to a
fixed TDD UL-DL configuration:
  * Improved DL packet throughput for pico cells;
  * Similar DL packet throughput for macro cells;
  * Similar UL packet throughput for pico cells in low cell load;
  * Significantly decreased UL packet throughput for pico cells in medium to high cell load and for macro cells.
For TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic adaptation, it is beneficial to
configure TDD UL-DL configuration #0 when there is no traffic in the cell from
the perspective of energy saving, which on the other hand may impact the
packet throughput for medium/low speed adaptation time scales.
# 7 Methods to support different time scales for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration
Depending on the required adaptation time scale, different methods can be
considered for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration. Independent of the signaling method,
the non-coordinated change of transmission direction among neighboring cells
may cause DL-UL interference in some subframes. Interference mitigation
techniques as discussed in Section 8 can be utilized to avoid the negative
impact of DL-UL interference on system performance.
## 7.1 Method 1 -- System information signaling
### 7.1.1 Description
This method supports TDD UL-DL reconfiguration by system information (SI)
change as in Rel-8, where the TDD UL-DL configuration is indicated by SIB. Two
approaches can be considered. One is the Rel-8 system information change
procedure and the other is reusing the Rel-10 ETWS (Earthquake and Tsunami
Warning System) notification procedure.
With the Rel-8 system information change procedure, the supported time scale
for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration is every 640ms or larger. It is noted that
legacy UEs can enjoy the benefits of TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on
traffic adaptation, since the method to adapt the TDD UL-DL configuration is
backward compatible. This method always affects all UEs connected to the cell,
even those that do not have data to transmit or receive.
With reusing the Rel-10 ETWS notification procedure, the supported time scale
for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration is every 320ms or larger depending on the
configured default paging cycle. The ETWS notification is indicated by a
paging message, but is updated regardless of the modification period unlike
the Rel-8 system information change procedure. It is noted that legacy UEs
cannot know the change of TDD UL-DL reconfiguration, since the notification
procedure is transparent to legacy UE.
With this method, ambiguity exists between eNB and UE on the TDD UL-DL
configuration, since the eNB does not know the exact time at which the UE
correctly decodes the updated SI, eNB may apply scheduling restriction during
this uncertain period, in order to properly maintain the communications
between the eNB and the UE. Further study is required to assess its impact on
performance. Possible enhancements can be specified to resolve the ambiguity.
Note that such enhancements are not applicable to legacy UEs.
Given that PDSCH/PUSCH HARQ timeline in TDD is determined by the TDD UL-DL
configuration, TDD UL-DL reconfiguration would impact the PDSCH/PUSCH HARQ
during reconfiguration. Possible enhancements on HARQ timing can be specified
to handle HARQ processes properly for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration.
The TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on SIB modification may require eNB to
transmit paging notification more frequently than in a typical Rel-8/9/10
system, and meanwhile may require UE to monitor paging more frequently.
Possible enhancements can be specified to reduce the paging overheads due to
TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic adaptation.
### 7.1.2 Specification impact
Rel-8 system information change procedure has no specification impact to
enable TDD UL-DL reconfiguration by system information change, as it is
already supported by Rel-8. Reusing the Rel-10 ETWS notification procedure has
some specification impacts to enable the notification of TDD UL-DL
reconfiguration, which is transparent to legacy UEs. For both approaches, new
specification work may be required for enhancement(s) to resolve the ambiguity
on the TDD UL-DL configuration between eNB and UE, to handle the HARQ timing
properly when UL-DL configuration is changed, and to reduce paging overheads.
## 7.2 Method 2 -- RRC signaling
### 7.2.1 Description
This method supports TDD UL-DL reconfiguration by RRC signaling. The
corresponding time scale supported by this method depends on how fast the
reconfiguration can be performed. Typical time scale intended by this method
is on the order of 200ms. This method requires one reconfiguration message per
RRC connected user, unless a broadcast or a multicast approach is specified.
This method provides better traffic adaptation capability than Method 1, given
the support of smaller time scale for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration. Method 2 is
not applicable for the legacy UEs. Furthermore, if the higher layer signaled
TDD UL-DL configuration is different from that signaled in SIB1, it may not be
possible to schedule legacy UEs in all subframes since the legacy UEs'
PDSCH/PUSCH HARQ timeline follows the TDD UL-DL configuration in SIB1. This
may degrade the throughput of legacy UEs. In addition, if a specific subframe
is a DL subframe according to the SIB1 indicated TDD UL-DL configuration, but
is an UL subframe according to higher layer signaled TDD UL-DL configuration,
legacy UEs will still assume presence of reference signals e.g. CRS in such
subframes. This will for instance impact legacy UEs' RRM and RLM measurements.
Schemes to handle these issues and guarantee backwards compatibility should be
considered.
Ambiguity exists between eNB and UE on the TDD UL-DL configuration, if the eNB
does not know the exact time at which the UE applies the updated TDD UL-DL
configuration during reconfiguration. Further study is required to assess its
impact on performance. Possible enhancements can be specified to resolve the
ambiguity.
Similar to method 1, TDD UL-DL reconfiguration would impact the PDSCH/PUSCH
HARQ during reconfiguration. Possible enhancements on HARQ timing can be
specified to handle HARQ processes properly for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration.
### 7.2.2 Specification impact
New specification work is required to introduce the higher layer signaling for
TDD UL-DL configuration. Additional specification may be required for
enhancement(s) to resolve the ambiguity on the TDD UL-DL configuration between
eNB and UE, and to handle the HARQ timing properly when UL-DL configuration is
changed.
## 7.3 Method 3 -- MAC Control Element Signaling
### 7.3.1 Description
This method supports TDD UL-DL reconfiguration by MAC Control Element (CE)
signaling in the MAC header, with time scale of adaptation on the order of a
few tens of ms.
Method 3 provides the better traffic adaptation capability than Methods 1 and
2, given the support of smaller time scale for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration.
Method 3 is not applicable to legacy UEs. In case both legacy UEs and UEs
supporting Method 3 are to be served on the same serving cell, the impacts on
legacy UEs due to Method 3 are similar to those of Method 2 as discussed in
section 7.2.1.
Ambiguity exists between eNB and UE on the TDD UL-DL configuration, if the eNB
does not know the exact time at which the UE applies the updated TDD UL-DL
configuration during reconfiguration, especially considering MAC CE signaling
does not have its own error recovery process and the HARQ-ACK corresponding to
the PDSCH containing the MAC CE signaling may be received incorrectly. Further
study is required to assess its impact on performance. Possible enhancements
can be specified to resolve the ambiguity.
Similar to method 1, TDD UL-DL reconfiguration would impact the PDSCH/PUSCH
HARQ during reconfiguration. Possible enhancements on HARQ timing can be
specified to handle HARQ processes properly for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration.
### 7.3.2 Specification impact
New specification work is required to introduce the MAC CE for TDD UL-DL
configuration. Additional specification may be required for enhancement(s) to
resolve the ambiguity on the TDD UL-DL configuration between eNB and UE, and
to handle the HARQ timing properly when UL-DL configuration is changed.
## 7.4 Method 4 -- Physical layer signaling
### 7.4.1 Description
This method supports TDD UL-DL reconfiguration by physical layer design, with
time scale of adaptation on the order of 10ms. The TDD UL-DL configuration or
the transmission direction of a subframe can be explicitly indicated by
physical channel or signal. Alternatively, the transmission direction of a
subframe can be implicitly derived by the UE based on the eNB scheduling and
configurations for UL transmissions.
Method 4 provides the best traffic adaptation capability, given the support of
smaller time scale for TDD UL-DL reconfiguration than Methods 1 -- 3. Method 4
is not applicable to legacy UEs. In case both legacy UEs and UEs supporting
Method 4 are to be served on the same serving cell, the impacts on legacy UEs
due to Method 4 are similar to those of Method 2 as discussed in section
7.2.1.
Other aspects to consider for Method 4 include the CSI measurements and
support of interference mitigation schemes. With each cell individually
reconfiguring the subframe transmission direction on a radio frame basis, the
dynamics of inter-cell interference due to eNB-to-eNB and/or UE-to-UE
interference is expected to increase compared to Methods 1 -- 3, which may
make the CSI reporting less accurate. In addition, the traffic adaptation
capability on the time scale of 10ms may not be fully exploited in combination
with interference mitigation schemes requiring coordination among cells. In
these cases, it is however up to implementation how fast the adaptation is
performed.
The PDSCH/PUSCH HARQ timeline for UEs supporting Method 4 will not always
follow the TDD UL-DL configuration in SIB1, which requires specification work.
### 7.4.2 Specification impact
Specification work is required for the PDSCH/PUSCH HARQ timeline, as well as
methods to explicitly or implicitly determine the UL-DL configuration and/or
the transmission direction of a subframe. Specification work for
enhancement(s) to other physical channels and physical procedures may also be
needed.
# 8 Potential interference mitigation schemes
The interference mitigation schemes provided in this section, though
separately described, are not excluded to function jointly. Consideration of
using some other interference mitigation schemes that are not listed in this
section is also not precluded.
Interference mitigation for both data and control channels shall be
considered. Additional control channel interference mitigation such as HARQ
timeline change can be considered with other interference mitigation
techniques.
## 8.1 Scheme 1: Cell clustering interference mitigation
### 8.1.1 Description
This interference mitigation (IM) scheme is named Cell Clustering IM (CCIM),
which divides the cells into cell clusters according to some metric(s), such
as coupling loss, interference level, etc between cells.
A cell cluster can comprise one or more cells. The active transmissions of all
cells in each cell cluster shall be either uplink or downlink in any subframe
or a subset of all subframes, so that eNB-to-eNB interference and UE-to-UE
interference can be mitigated within the cell cluster. Hence, coordination
between the multiple cells belonging to the same cell cluster is needed.
Transmission directions in cells belonging to different cell clusters can be
different in a subframe by selecting the different TDD configurations freely,
in order to achieve the benefits of TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic
adaptation. By forming the cell clusters, eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE interference
between cells in different cell clusters can be controlled. An illustration is
shown in Figure 8.1.1.

Figure 8.1.1: Illustration of cell clustering
### 8.1.2 Specification impact
CCIM essentially includes two functionalities, i.e. forming cell clusters and
coordinating the transmission within each cell cluster. To properly form the
cell clusters, eNB measurements need to be possible, where the purpose of the
eNB measurements is to estimate the interference level from/to another eNB. In
addition, necessary signaling and/or procedures related to the eNB
measurements could be supported. For coordination within a cell cluster,
further study is required on what needs to be specified as it depends on how
coordination is performed.
## 8.2 Scheme 2: Scheduling dependent interference mitigation
### 8.2.1 Description
This interference mitigation (IM) scheme is named Scheduling Dependent IM
(SDIM), where the eNB adjusts the scheduling strategies e.g. link adaptation,
resource allocation, transmit power, transmission direction of a subframe,
considering e.g. the DL and UL channel quality, the eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE
interference, traffic load, etc. The adjustment of scheduling strategies can
be based on the variation of the observed interference, the estimation of
induced interference, inter-cell interference coordination information
exchange, and/or cell load.
### 8.2.2 Specification impact
For SDIM, eNB measurements need to be possible, where the purpose of the eNB
measurements is to estimate the interference level from/to another eNB. In
addition, necessary signaling and/or procedures related to the eNB
measurements could be supported. Additional UE measurements may also be
needed, where the purpose of the UE measurement is to estimate the
interference level from another eNB or UE. New signaling to support improved
uplink and/or downlink power control or to support inter-cell interference
coordination information exchange may be needed. Applying some of the
scheduling strategies for interference mitigation, e.g. link adaptation, may
not need to be specified.
## 8.3 Scheme 3: Interference mitigation based on eICIC/FeICIC schemes
### 8.3.1 Description
With different TDD UL-DL configurations in different cells, there are
potential interferences from eNB-to-eNB and/or UE-to-UE due to the different
transmission directions in adjacent cells. For Rel-10/11 eICIC/FeICIC,
extensive specification work has been made to cope with the interference
conditions caused in the HetNet deployment, where the interference condition
is caused by the strong transmit signal from nearby cells. Although the causes
of these interference conditions are different, it can be considered to reuse
the interference mitigation schemes and procedures from eICIC/FeICIC to TDD
UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic adaptation, e.g., almost blank
subframes, restricted RLM/RRM measurements, dual CSI measurement reports,
etc..
### 8.3.2 Specification impact
Additional eNB measurements may need to be possible, where the purpose of the
eNB measurements is to estimate the interference level from/to another eNB. In
addition, necessary signaling and/or procedures related to the eNB
measurements could be supported. Additional UE measurements may also be
needed, where the purpose of the UE measurement is to estimate the
interference level from another eNB or UE.
## 8.4 Scheme 4: Interference suppressing interference mitigation
### 8.4.1 Description
Interference suppressing interference mitigation (ISIM) may be considered for
UL transmission of either Pico or Macro cells. Suppression of one or more of
the dominant eNB-to-eNB interfering signals may be possible, e.g. by enhanced
receiver such as MMSE-IRC, or by joint transceiver technologies such as
interference alignment or interference nulling.
### 8.4.2 Specification impact
ISIM is largely implementation dependent, but may benefit from some signaling
assistance. For example, collided subframes among pico/macro cells could be
exchanged among interfering eNBs to assist in the interference suppression.
Necessary signaling and/or procedures related to the eNB interference
measurements could be supported.
# 9 Conclusion and recommendations
Based on the studies carried out, the following conclusions are made:
  * TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic adaptation provides benefits in terms of packet throughput and energy saving in some of the evaluated deployment scenarios.
  * The benefits on packet throughput, when present, are mainly observed for low to medium system loadings, and may be observed in either DL or UL or both directions.
  * Decreased UL packet throughput for macro cells compared with the fix configuration is observed without any interference mitigation schemes due to severe eNB-to-eNB interference in multi-macro/pico cell scenarios.
  * Interference mitigation is essential to reduce the negative impact on system performance caused by DL-UL interference due to opposite transmission directions in different cells.
  * Significant coexistence challenges have been observed to apply different TDD UL-DL configurations in different cells for scenarios 1 -- 8 in section 5 without any interference mitigation mechanisms. It is feasible to apply different TDD UL-DL configurations in different cells for scenarios 1 -- 4 in section 5, only provided sufficient interference mitigation mechanisms are adopted. No interference mitigation schemes have been agreed for scenarios 1 -- 4 in section 5, and no conclusion on coexistence feasibility with interference mitigation mechanisms has been made for scenarios 5 -- 8 in section 5.
  * Faster TDD UL-DL reconfiguration time scale provides larger benefits than slower TDD UL-DL reconfiguration time scale. The amount of required specification changes varies depending on the supported reconfiguration time scales.
    * Potential PDSCH/PUSCH HARQ timeline related issues are identified with TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic adaptation, which may require specification changes especially for fast TDD UL-DL reconfiguration time scales.
  * There exists impact on legacy UEs due to TDD UL-DL reconfiguration, on the aspects of achievable DL/UL throughput, RLM/RRM measurement, and/or CSI reporting. The impact on legacy UEs' DL/UL throughput is expected to increase as the reconfiguration is performed faster.
Based on the above conclusions, it is recommended to specify the necessary
mechanism(s) to support TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on traffic adaptation.
Further study is needed to decide on the supported adaptation time scale and
assess the impact on legacy UEs with TDD UL-DL reconfiguration based on
traffic adaptation. It is also recommended to further study and specify
interference mitigation schemes.
