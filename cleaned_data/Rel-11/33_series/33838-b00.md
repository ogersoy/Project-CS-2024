# 1 Scope
The present document studies more focussed the high-level solutions
possibilities for PUCI described in the technical report (TR 33.937) on PUCI.
The scope of the study includes:
\- Study of the PUCI related information:
\- What information to be stored in the HSS.
\- Type of PUCI information to be exchanged (e.g. scoring information,
contextual information) and how this information should be structured, or even
between which nodes the information should be sent.
\- If and how PUCI information should be sent inside SIP.
\- Study on Invoking of 3rd party PUCI AS or Supplementary Services (SS)
depending on configuration.
\- Interworking
\- with non-IMS networks.
\- with other IMS services like SRVCC, ICS, and service continuity.
\- Types of communication that should/can be covered by PUCI, and how the
different types of communication affect the PUCI solution.
\- How much of PUCI that can be achieved via prevention and how much needs to
be done via treatment.
\- PUCIF to PUCIF communication.
\- Use of existing methods of user notification for PUCI communication.
\- Mitigation of source identity spoofing, especially from non-IMS networks,
on the effectiveness of the PUCI mechanism.
\- Illustrative use of standardized PUCI features in typical deployment
scenarios.

# 4 Definition of PUCI scope
## 4.1 Communication modes
The PUCI study TR 33.937 [3] discussed PUCI primarily in the context of voice
communications, but did not specify which modes of communication a PUCI
solution should apply to. To address this question, the following
considerations are put forward:
\- It is desirable to have as complete a protection as possible. Thus, PUCI
should preferably cover all communication modes carried in IMS. In particular,
this includes communication modes utilized in services defined for IMS, such
as voice, video, and instant messaging (IMS Multimedia Telephony Service TR
22.173 [4]). Other possibilities include protection against presence spam,
i.e., UC embedded in presence subscription messages (e.g., in the From or
Contact fields, depending on what is displayed to the recipient for an
authorization decision).
\- However, since the overall goal of PUCI is to avoid disturbing the
subscriber with UC, there is likely little utility in attempting to block
communication elements in an already established session. Thus, the primary
aim is to prevent UC session establishment attempts. Consequently, content-
based protection mechanisms could be beneficial for the case of instant
messaging UC carried in SIP Messages, but is likely ineffective when applied
to the media plane, e.g., of an established MSRP session. It could be studied
if media plane screening solutions can help in addition to mechanisms studied
in this TR.
Note: The addition of an media element during an ongoing session might
introduce a potential issue, if it is possible for an attacker to spoof the
originating identity.
## 4.2 Bulk communications vs targeted communications
The PUCI study TR 33.937 [3] considered scenarios with targeted communications
to specific individuals, for instance, in a stalker type of scenario, as well
as the more spam-like bulk communication scenario which indiscriminately
targets large recipient populations.
Since existing Supplementary Services (SS) for the Multimedia Telephony
service TS 22.101 [4] already includes protection mechanisms for targeted UC
through Malicious Communication Identification (MCID) and Call Barring (CB),
PUCI scope for targeted communication should be studied only for mechanisms
that are not already covered by SS.
# 5 Design principles and security requirements
## 5.1 Design principles
The PUCI solution will adhere to the following design principles:
\- No new capabilities are required on the IMS core elements. For example the
support of iFC, initial Filtering Criteria, in S-CSCF as the basic IMS
function is good enough to redirect SIP signals to a PUCI AS.
\- There will be new originating and terminating S-CSCF triggers. For example
PUCI AS can be triggered by utilizing the existing iFC.
\- No impacts on the UEs or its interfaces, including the Gm interface or user
interface.
\- PUCI processing will be performed in an Application Server.
\- If UC score and other PUCI related information needs to be signaled between
carriers, it shall originate and terminate in a PUCI AS, thereby being
transparent to the IMS core. For example UC score and other PUCI related
information can be carried in the SIP header as an optional information
element.
\- SPUCI solution will not mandate user notification or user interaction, but
if there is user notification, only existing methods will be used, as not to
impact the UE or usage experience.
\- The UC score and other PUCI related information will be defined at a
generic level, with their specific meanings being left to operator policy.
\- Mapping of UC score and other PUCI related information between carriers
will be per interconnection agreements.
\- The invocation of PUCI, thresholds, and actions taken will be based on the
contractual relationship between the user and the carrier, where the
thresholds are based on operator policy.
\- PUCI processing may be performed on behalf of IMS and non-IMS users,
including PSTN users.
\- National legislature and/or operator policy may impact the PUCI actions to
be taken.
\- PUCI may apply to all IMS services to include and not limited to: session
based services (voice, video), messaging, and data delivery.
## 5.2 Security requirements
Following are security requirements on SPUCI:
1\. The IMS should provide a means for IMS-users to report communication as a
UC.
Note: This requirement still holds because without this it is not possible to
report a UC. There is no conflict with design principle on \"No impacts to the
UEs or its interfaces, including the Gm interface or user interface.\"
2\. The IMS should provide the ability to the operator to extract information
from the signalling and other means to provide an indication of the likelihood
whether the communication is unsolicited.
3\. The IMS should provide a mechanism to allow variation in communication
handling based on UC related information.
4\. The solution should also work in interworking scenarios with legacy
networks and devices, in particular when using Single Radio VCC, IMS Service
Continuity, and IMS Centralized Services.
# 6 Preventive measures
## 6.1 Introduction
Preventive measures can be regarded as measures that prevent a malicious user
from initiating SPIT/UC at all while reactive measures try to protect the
SPIT/UC victim if the SPIT/UC has already been initiated. Therefore preventive
measures are the first line of defense against SPIT/UC and are well suited to
at least significantly diminish the SPIT/UC problem, before it arises. They
can be split into:
\- non-technical prevention measures like legislation or contractual
agreements and
\- technical prevention measures like the reliable identification of the
originating communication source
## 6.2 Non-technical prevention measures
### 6.2.1 General
Non-technical prevention measures are mainly on the level of:
\- legislation that may be and usually is country- or region-specific
\- contractual agreements between operators and their customers
\- contractual agreements between different operators, called Service Level
Agreements (SLAs)
### 6.2.2. Legislation
The preventive effect of legislation is that it illegalizes activities like
SPIT/UC and inflicts a penalty on individuals that contravene the
corresponding law. In a specific country (e.g. Germany) or a specific region
(e.g. Europe, especially EU) with a coherent legislation this may be a
powerful countermeasure, if the identity of the SPITter can be verified.
Although SPIT/UC related legislation is already available for a number of
countries -- among which a significant number of OECD countries -- it differs
unfortunately in the definition of SPIT/UC, in the definition of SPIT/UC
concerned communication services, and in the handling of SPIT/UC suspicious or
SPIT/UC identified communication. This scattered SPIT/UC legislation landscape
with different SPIT/UC prevention approaches complicates the verification and
the penalization of SPITters and opens also legal grey-zones in cross-border
communication while it achieves a consistent protection in the corresponding
country or the corresponding region where the law is valid.
As an example for this problem look at the consent achievement whether a
communication is SPIT/UC or not. In one region (e.g. EU) a SPIT/UC prevention
law determines the Opt-In principle where the initiator of a bulk UC
communication (e.g. advertisement) has to prove that the recipient has
explicitly given consent. In another region (e.g. US) another SPIT/UC
prevention law determines the Opt-Out principle with the consequence that the
initiator is allowed to perform the same bulk UC communication without consent
of the recipient if there is an easy possibility to get deleted from the
address list in order to stop further nuisance in a timely manner. While each
law is consistent in the corresponding region, these two different principles
are unfortunately mutually exclusive in EU â†” US communication and open
therefore a legal grey-zone.
Therefore it would be helpful to define as well a set of rules regulating the
legal aspects of cross-border communication.
### 6.2.3 Contractual agreements between operators and their customers
Contractual agreements between operators and their customers can have a
similar preventive effect as legislation. Any individual wishing to use the
services of an operator has to enter into a contract with the corresponding
operator. There the operator can specify the terms of use and the consequences
if the customer defies the agreed contractual agreements. In contrast to
legislation the consequences are now not generally defined by a law but only
specifically by an operator. The potential customer has the possibility to
either accept the contractual agreements or to choose an operator with less
strict terms of use.
The terms of use may control the behavior of a customer by certain parameters
like for example the number of calls per time interval, the number of
international calls per time interval or the total duration of international
calls per time interval. Additionally the operator can restrict the usage of
its services to \'only private and non-commercial\' and rate calls
contravening these conditions another price making misuse by SPITters
unattractive. In worst case, if the operator identifies a specific customer as
a permanent source of malicious usage, the operator may reserve the right to
terminate the contract with this user.
However with the rising of VoIP and with the interconnection of the currently
existing VoIP islands it is no longer guaranteed that all VoIP users will have
a contract with an operator at all. Nevertheless it is interesting to see that
today also well-known VoIP providers that offer free communication over the
Internet behave operator-like (charging of small fees; terms of use
restricting the capabilities of a user), if they connect to existing PSTN
networks. But even the contracts of the different operators may differ in
their conditions so that the trust into an operator may range from high to
low.
On the other hand these varying levels of trust give trusted operators also
the opportunity to differentiate from their competitors. Today it is not clear
whether the majority of users is willing to accept a large number of nuisances
like SPIT/UC for the benefit of a lower price. Therefore the trust level of
the operator will perhaps also have consequences for a differentiation between
the kinds of customers joining the network: \'normal\' customers may perhaps
accept an additional charge for a network, almost clean of nuisances like
SPIT/UC, while customers with a restricted budget and happy with \'trying out
new things\' may choose an operator with lower price and lower trust level.
But trusted operators carry then the responsibility to which other operator
networks they connect under which terms to protect their own network against
external nuisances. This is usually regulated by contractual agreements
between different operators, usually called Service Level Agreements (SLAs;
see next sub-section).
Generally even the non-operator centric part of the VoIP community in IETF
acknowledges in RFC 5039, section 3.13 that today\'s operator controlled
networks experience relatively little SPIT/UC and takes this as proof that
this kind of arrangement can work.
### 6.2.4 Contractual agreements between different operators (SLAs)
Operator networks face two kinds of major interfaces, one towards their
customers and one towards peering operator networks. While the last sub-
section has illustrated the possibilities to tackle the SPIT/UC problem in the
own operator\'s network, this section deals with the protection of the
operator network against SPIT/UC traffic originating from peering operator
networks. The protection is achieved by bilateral contractual agreements
between the peering operators, usually called SLAs.
These SLAs may for example specify the amount of allowed nuisance originating
from the peering network, countermeasures to identify and stop malicious
sources in the peering network, thresholds for SPIT/UC attacks where the
operator is allowed to block the complete traffic of its peering counterpart
or compensatory payments if the SLAs are violated.
The preventive effect of these SLAs is that they delegate responsibility
towards the peering operator and regulate the consequences if the peering
operator doesn\'t live up to this responsibility. SLAs have turned out to be a
powerful means for operators to maintain control over their network and the
connected customers. They are widely adopted, e.g. in the telco and the ISP
area and are therefore well suited as a preventive measure suppressing the
generation of SPIT/UC as far as possible.
## 6.3 Technical prevention measures
A technical prevention measure is the reliable identification of the
communication source. The preventive effect is that the communication source
is no longer able to act anonymously and, as a consequence, can therefore be
held responsible for actions like e.g. the sending of SPIT/UC.
The effectiveness of reliable identification is underlined by RFC 5039 [15]
clause 4. RFC 5039 [15] sees the reliable identification of the communication
source as the key enabler to make reactive SPIT/UC measures work. The key role
of reliable identification is also accentuated in various sections of 3GPP TR
33.937 [3].
This item is discussed in more detail in clause 7.1.2 of this TR. There the
already widely adopted mechanism of \'Pâ€‘Asserted Identity\' is proposed as an
agreed identity mechanism for interworking between VoIP operators mutually
trusting each other. Additionally the definition of a new optional signaling
element allowing VoIP operators to reliably convey rich information related to
SPIT/UC is discussed as a long term solution.
# 7 Interworking with non-IMS systems
## 7.1 Background
The present clause provides background information, such as reviewing relevant
related efforts in other standards bodies.
### 7.1.1 IETF Work on SIP Peering
The SPEERMINT WG in IETF is currently working on defining use cases,
requirements, architectures, mechanisms, and best practices for SIP service
provider peering (at the service level, not the IP-routing level), including
considerations such as establishment of trust, security, and resistance to
abuse and attacks (see [charter-speermint-2010-04-02.txt]{.underline} [7]).
While protection against UC is explicitly outside the WG scope, the results
will inevitably have implications for how protection against UC can be
achieved.
Interworking with non-IMS SIP-based services that comply with IETF standards
appears to be one significant case to consider. Thus, it is desirable to align
PUCI considerations for interworking with non-IMS systems with the SIP Peering
work in IETF.
The use cases considered for SIP peering are divided along two dimensions (as
described in RFC5486 [8]):
\- Direct (no transit) or indirect (using transit)
\- Static (pre-established peering) or on-demand (limited pre-existing state)
Static peering is defined as the case when a pre-association between the SIP
service providers is required for the initiation of any real-time transactions
(like a SIP message). On-demand peering is said to occur when any information
that needs to be exchanged between domains in support of peering can be
learned through a dynamic protocol mechanism. The on-demand peering model
mimics the Internet email model. However, it is noted in draft-ietf-speermint-
voip-consolidated-usecases-18 [9] that on-demand SIP peering is uncommon in
production, and a detailed description is therefore omitted.
Security threats and suggested countermeasures are identified in draft-ietf-
speermint-voipthreats-05 [10], and security requirements of mutual
authentication, protection of confidentiality and integrity protection, and
the possibility of passing media security attributes are mentioned. It is
stated that the authentication, confidentiality, and integrity requirements
can be fulfilled through the use of, e.g., TLS or IPsec. TLS is perceived as
having some advantages in the way it can be coupled to the specified
functional elements, but it is also noted that there may be particular cases
where IPsec is preferable.
Several other countermeasures to attacks against peering are also considered.
However, most of these, with the exception of the use of _strong sender
identity assertions_ , are not directly relevant for protection against UC;
but may be relevant indirectly with respect to a step in an attack to enable
UC injection.
Two main alternatives to achieve strong identity assertions are considered:
\- A chain of trust model using Network-Asserted-Identity or P-Asserted-
Identity (see RFC3324 [11] and RFC3325 [12]), or
\- Use of cryptographic signatures using SIP Authenticated Identity Body (see
RFC3893 [13]) or SIP Identity (see RFC4474 [14])
It is noted that the transitive trust requirement for the first alternative
can be seen as an underlying weakness, and the second alternative requires a
Public Key Infrastructure to be in place.
### 7.1.2 Operator SPIT/UC interworking and source identification
#### 7.1.2.1 Introduction
Reliable identification of the originating user/domain has been identified as
a building block of many successful technical SPIT/UC measures, for example
blacklist or whitelist.
While identification of the originating user/domain in itself would not be
sufficient for SPIT/UC prevention, it is rather the basis for other methods:
Because of address forging technical SPIT/UC prevention measures relying on
source identities like black-listing of SPIT/UC sources or the evaluation of a
SPIT/UC score in the terminating domain may be significantly impaired. This
problem has already been discussed in TR 33.937 [3].
None of the already existing identification mechanisms like
\- Open Proxy Handshake
\- P-Asserted Identity
\- SIP Identity
\- Trusted Interconnect with IPsec/TLS, potentially combined with P-Asserted
Identity
\- Combination of SPIT/UC score transmission (see draft Spam Score for SIP
(draft-wing-sipping-spam-score-02) [18]) with identification of originating
user/domain
provides by itself a satisfying solution of the problem, that is to say \'a
reliable identification of the originating user/domain\' for IMS as well as
for non-IMS networks. The reasons are that
\- they are not ubiquitously available;
\- they rely potentially on chained trust like \'Trusted Interconnect with
IPsec/TLS\', but trust is in general not transitive without additional
agreements;
\- SIP signaling enhancements like RFC 4474 (SIP Identity) or the draft-wing-
sipping-spam-score-02 suffer from the fact that the required signaling
elements may either be changed or even blocked by Back-to-Back User Agents,
thus preventing the requested functionality.
In summary, it can be stated that today and even in the mid-term no widespread
solution exists that generally solves the \'identification of the originating
user/domain\' problem for the purposes of 3GPP SPIT/UC prevention. To get out
of this deadlock, a two-step approach is proposed:
1) Use of P-Asserted Identity as an agreed identity assertion mechanism for
interworking between VoIP operators mutually trusting each other
2) Definition of a new optional SIP signaling element allowing VoIP operators
to reliably convey rich information related to SPIT/UC as a long-term solution
#### 7.1.2.2 Interworking between mutually trusting VoIP operators
The interworking on a trust basis is achieved between VoIP operators that are
associated by mutual contractual agreements and therefore have a certain
degree of trust in each other. This is comparable to the \'circles of trust\',
discussed by Rosenberg and Jennings in RFC 5039. It is expected that IMS-based
VoIP operators will usually interwork on a trust basis but the interworking is
not restricted to IMS networks. Every VoIP operator supporting \'P-Asserted
Identity\' as the agreed identity assertion mechanism and willing to bind
themselves by contractual agreements is able to participate in the
interworking of mutually trusting VoIP operators. Every domain of a trusted
VoIP operator can as well be connected to other VoIP domains not supporting
\'P-Asserted Identity\', but these domains not supporting \'P-Asserted
Identity\' are per default assumed to have a lower trust level. Therefore,
with respect to PUCI mechanisms, the world of VoIP domains is split into two
parts: either supporting \'P-Asserted Identity\' or not supporting
\'P-Asserted Identity\'.
{width="3.6368055555555556in" height="2.352777777777778in"}
P-Asserted Identity is selected as identity assertion mechanism to reliably
evaluate the identity of users, because the P-Asserted Identity SIP header has
already been standardized as a private extension to SIP (RFC 3325 [12]). It
enables a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the identity of
authenticated users. The trust in P-Asserted Identity is based on the fact
that it is added by the network (trusted SIP servers) and not by a potentially
malicious user. An additional advantage of using P-Asserted identity in a
first step is that it does not put too much burden on networks that are
usually well controlled and that are not expected to be the primary source of
SPIT/UC trouble.
Although originally proposed to the IETF by 3GPP, P-Asserted Identity seems to
have spread beyond IMS networks, but is not ubiquitously available. Even if
ubiquitously available, it would not generally solve the problem of reliable
identification because P-Asserted Identity is not signed by the originating
SIP server. Leaving P-Asserted Identity unsigned, requires additionally that
the mutually trusting VoIP operators are interconnected by means of a trusted
interconnection network, e.g. according to the Za inter-domain interface as
specified in TS 33.210 [19]. Za represents the interface between the Security
Gateways (SEG) of two different security domains (denoted as security domain A
and B in the example below). Za is an inter-operator interface between two
operators A and B, connected via a potentially unsecure intermediate network.
{width="5.386805555555555in" height="2.1902777777777778in"}
According to TS 33.210 [19] the provisioning of a Za interface applies only to
signaling traffic. Integrity and confidentiality is ensured by an IPsec tunnel
between the two security domains. The required IPsec ESP tunnel functionality
is
  * integrity, authentication and anti-replay protection (mandatory)
  * confidentiality by encryption (optional)
But this means on the other side: If a P-Asserted Identity header is received
from a non-trusted domain, this header has to be cut and with that the level
of trust in the originating identity is per default reduced. This implies that
trusted VoIP domains may not be connected via untrusted intermediary domains.
Between mutually trusting VoIP operators P-Asserted Identity enables an
effective SPIT/UC prevention in the terminating network, in conjunction with
others methods such as Supplementary Services, because the originating user is
reliably identified. Thus SPIT/UC prevention methods like black-listing or the
evaluation of a SPIT/UC score according to the policy of the terminating
operator will get effective without the need to exchange SPIT/UC scores
between the domains of trusted VoIP operators.
The usage of P-Asserted Identity alone already allows a SPIT/UC related
differentiation between trusted and other VoIP domains. All users of other
VoIP domains are per default set to a reduced trust level. This allows
reactions in the terminating network like blocking of calls, redirecting to a
SPIT/UC voice mailbox in conditional call forwarding or indicating of reduced
trust level.
# 8 PUCI architectural considerations
## 8.1 Overview
## 8.2 PUCI information storage
PUCI is a subscription service, therefore there is a need to store relevant
information of the PUCI service that are important for the S-CSCF to know
whether and how PUCI service should be invoked and when a caller is considered
as unsolicited. Therefore the basic PUCI information stored consists of the
following:
[- PUCI Flag:]{.underline} A logical indication saying whether the subscriber
is subscribed to PUCI service or not; this could be realized as part of the
Initial Filter Criteria (iFC) in the HSS to invoke one or more PUCI ASs.
[- PUCI Threshold:]{.underline} Settings which tells the PUCI AS what to do
when a certain UC Score is received, e.g., a subscriber can set that an
incoming call with a score above 5 should be forwarded to a given number and
with a score above 10 the call should be dropped. It is on the operator to
decide whether the PUCI Threshold is a value valid for all subscribers in the
network or is modifiable by a subscriber. PUCI Threshold is stored in the PUCI
AS.
[- PUCI Action:]{.underline} Depending on operator policy, this is subscriber
preference setting on what should be done after unsolicited communication is
detected, e.g., dropping of the call etc. The operator could decide a global
policy for action to be taken or leave it on user decision. PUCI Action is
stored in the PUCI AS.
[- Routing profile:]{.underline} This is information about the order in which
PUCI ASes / Functions should be accessed for a given subscriber. Based on
operator policy, a subscriber can modify the strength of protection, for
example, somewhere between strict to lenient check. This may have a bearing on
the routing profile.
Collectively we call the above four items as PUCI User Policy (PUP). Only the
iFC is stored in the HSS. This means as a consequence that the PUP is not
stored centrally at a unique location in the network but decentrally at least
at two different locations. A reasonable place to store all other information
than iFC would be the PUCI AS.
## 8.3 PUCI function invocation
The PUCI function is invoked as any other application server in IMS with the
initial filter criteria (iFC) setting in the S-CSCF, which are downloaded from
the HSS on a per user basis, as described in TS 23.228 [20]. The iFC for the
PUCI service can be configured based on subscription or on operator policy. It
is recommended that the PUCI function is invoked as early as possible in order
to perform the PUCI functions before further handling of other functions. The
handling of originating and terminating requests may differ.
Initial Filter Criteria (iFC) are included in the user profile (described in
TS.23.228 [20] Annex B), which is downloaded from the HSS to the S-CSCF as
part of the registration procedure. The \"PUP Routing Profile\" (clause 8.2)
_could_ thus be encoded using the iFC Priority field and the AS name for the
ServerName field. The Priority field values (increasing order) then indicate
the ordering of the ASs to traverse. Moreover, the \"PUP PUCI Flag\" (clause
8.2) _could_ be encoded simply in terms of whether the iFC for calling a PUCI
Function/AS is enabled or disabled (or present vs absent) for a particular
subscriber. The remaining information in clause 8.2, PUCI Threshold and PUCI
Action, _could_ be stored in the PUCI Function/AS itself. This way,
specification changes to the HSS or Cx interfaces would not be needed.
## 8.4 Compatibility with IMS centralized services, SRVCC, and service
continuity
### 8.4.1 General
As stated in TR 33.937 [3], it is desirable to strive for a consistent user
experience across access scenarios. Thus, it is important to ensure that the
approach chosen for PUCI can be made compatible with IMS Centralized Services
(ICS), Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC), and Service Continuity
(SC).
### 8.4.2 Mechanisms based on supplementary services
The sole purpose of IMS centralized services (see e.g., TS 22.101 [5], clause
22) is to use the IMS service engine to provide the telephony service for the
CS access in addition to the PS access. This also implies that the same IMS
TAS (including supplementary services according to 22.173 [4]) will be used
irrespectively of whether the user uses a CS access or a PS access. As a
result, when the SS-based PUCI functionality is used, this will be provided
for the user irrespectively of access, and by the same service engine. No
additional functionality will be required to handle these cases, and no
limitations are foreseen.
If SRVCC is applied, this will not impact SS based PUCI functionality, as the
service engine is not changed. The same applies when using Service Continuity
in general, as the service engine remains the same.
Thus, mechanisms in TR 33.937 [3] based strictly on the use of existing
mechanisms in Supplementary Services (SS) will also be compatible with ICS,
SRVCC, and SC.
### 8.4.3 IMR
IMR PUCI functionality is executed by the iFC settings in the S-CSCF, which
are downloaded from the HSS on a per user basis (TS 23.228 [20]). Since the
detection of unsolicited users is performed only at the session setup defined
in the iFCs, the marking of the session with a UC score and other PUCI related
information is independent of further handling by other application servers.
When the session is established, then there is no functional impact on mid-
call features like SRVCC and SC, which are executed by the SCC AS. There is
also no impact to ICS since with this feature all sessions are anchored in the
TAS for supplementary service handling in IMS, which is a separate application
server and which is like the SCC AS invoked by the iFCs after the PUCI AS.
NOTE: UE involvement is out of scope.
# 9 Solution alternatives
## 9.1 High level architecture
This section describes the high-level architecture for PUCI in case of using
the PUCI functions IMR, mechanisms based on supplementary services as well as
extensions to supplementary services. The PUCI functions are hosted by a PUCI
application server (PUCI AS), which supports at least one of the three
methods, IMR, Supplementary Services (SS) or extended SS. The PUCI AS may be
collocated with the Telephony Application Server (TAS), but iFC should point
to the relevant SS to be executed for the PUCI functions. In general, the
different options, as described in clause 9 of TR 33.937 [3] apply, i.e. the
PUCI AS can be collocated with the TAS or separated. Figure 9.1-1 shows UE A
as session originator and UE B as session terminator of the communication.

# 10 PUCI information exchange
## 10.1 PUCI information type and structure
The intention of providing PUCI information is to alert that the corresponding
session is matter of UC with a certain likelihood indicated by the UC Score.
The PUCI information, e.g., the UC Score, is updated by the terminating PUCI
AS according to the check(s) performed and it is used in the terminating
S-CSCF for re-routing the session to an answering machine or elsewhere
depending on user or operator policy of the terminating network. The threshold
based on which a session is treated as UC is based on operator policies of the
terminating network; the operator might also allow subscribers to set the
threshold.
SIP proxies will, in accordance with their compatibility procedures, ignore
the UC Score and the UC Indicator. Back to Back User Agents (B2BUAs) may
however remove the UC Score and the UC Indicator. Therefore, an environment
where UC Scoring is to be used successfully needs to ensure that no B2BUAs act
on UC Scores.
The scoring information should consist at least of the following two basic
parameters:
\- UC Score: The parameter range is configured by the operator, indicating the
likelihood of UC as well as the hostname where the PUCI test got executed.
If PUCI scoring takes place in the originating network, the interpretation in
the terminating network of the UC Score generated in the originating network
needs to be defined in the SLAs of the IMS level interworking. Possibly,
multilateral SLA for all operators joining in the PUCI scheme may be
advantageous.
In the general case, intermediary networks need to be considered. Whether this
is an issue will depend on the concrete deployments. Note also that clause
10.2 would allow intermediary networks adding PUCI scores.
Corresponding SLAs should define originator of the particular UC Score because
it is needed to for evaluation of the UC Score.
NOTE: If communication is happening within operator network then
authentication is not needed.
\- UC Indicator: This parameter should be a simple Boolean that is set by the
originating network. It marks explicitly the sessions as UC or not and is
evaluated by the terminating network.
The UC Score and the UC Indicator could be incorporated into the SIP header as
shown in the example below:
NOTE: According to the text in this clause, the UC score is always present
when the UC indicator is present. It could not be determined, in general, in
how far the latter adds value in the presence of the former. This question
will have to be solved for individual deployments.

## 10.2 PUCI information signalling
Figure 10.2-1 shows a message sequence of PUCI signalling. UE A, in the
figure, is the sending or calling party while UE B is the receiving party or
callee. UE B is protected against unsolicited communication with the PUCI
service. In case UE A and UE B belong to different operators or are roaming,
the originating or intermediary operators may already perform PUCI checks
before forwarding the session to the terminating operator. The registration
step R is executed at the time of the registration of UE B this step is part
of the regular Cx-Put/Cx-Pull operation (Public User Identity, Private User
Identity, S-CSCF name) to the HSS and the corresponding Cx-Put Resp/Cx-Pull
Resp (user information) to the S-CSCF.
Figure 10.2-1: Simple PUCI service invocation (those in red need to be
standardized).R. : The Callee (UE B) side S-CSCF and the HSS exchange messages
over the Cx interface as required for the IMS registration procedure.
0) The PUCI AS is initialized with global operator settings, e.g. black-list
that applies to all users for which the operator has legal consent.
1) The S-CSCF receives a SIP INVITE message from the Caller (UE A). This
message may include UC Score and other PUCI information if PUCI check was
already performed in any of the networks through which the message traversed.
NOTE: Addition of UC Score in SIP header needs IETF work.
2) Then the S-CSCF checks whether the PUCI Flag is on for the given Callee (UE
B).
3) If the PUCI service applies for the Callee (UE B) then the PUCI AS/Function
is invoked by the S-CSCF. For this, the S-CSCF sends a SIP INVITE message to
the PUCI AS/Function. This message may include UC Score if it was already
provided in Step 1.
4) The PUCI AS then checks the operator global setting and provides PUCI
filtering based on techniques like those given in Section 3 of [15]. Other
techniques could also be possible, e.g. CAPTCHA. These checks result in an
updated UC Score. The PUCI AS also verifies the UC Score against PUCI
Threshold and PUCI Action if all is fine then, based on the Routing Profile,
the PUCI AS sends the SIP INVITE with the UC Score to another PUCI AS for
further checks or sends it to the S-CSCF.
5) The PUCI AS sends the SIP INVITE message to the S-CSCF.
6) The S-CSCF then forwards the SIP INVITE to the Callee (UE B).
## 10.3 PUCI function communication
In case of a distributed PUCI AS or functions for IMR, different
functionalities (e.g. MCD, black/whitelist check, turing test, etc) can be
hosted in different ASes. For this reason UC Score should be indicated from
one PUCI function to other within or in different ASes. The UC Score will be
added up; operator can give weight to a given PUCI function. Each PUCI
function will check whether the UC Score has reached a threshold based on
which the given communication will be considered a UC. The threshold for the
UC Score can be set by the operator.
The UC Score can be in the simplest way a linear function of the corresponding
metric, e.g. call rate. An example of determining the UC Score is shown in
Figure 10.3-1:
{width="3.8381944444444445in" height="2.21875in"}
Figure 10.3-1: Simple UC Score excample.
Once the metric exceeds a certain threshold 1 (e.g. call rate > 15/min), then
it starts creating a corresponding UC Score for the session up to a threshold
2, where already the maximum UC Score is reached.
How to combine the UC Scores is up to the operator policy. A simple example is
shown in Figure 10.3-2.
{width="3.6152777777777776in" height="2.5416666666666665in"}
Figure 10.3-2: Simple UC Score accumulation excample.
The different PUCI functions generate a UC Score which is weighted based on
the operator\'s policy and simply combined. How to weight is out of scope of
this specification.
In case UC Score is used there could also be a necessity of communicating PUCI
UC Score between PUCI ASes of different networks. This will happen in cases
where call originates and ends in different network.
Privacy issues are subject to national regulations and may lead to
restrictions on inter-operator PUCI information.
## 10.4 PUCI user notification
Depending on operator policies, IMS should support capabilities that allow
notifying an originating party that a performed or attempted communication to
the terminating party has been classified as UC. As a result of this
classification the originating party maybe added to a list of UC sources.
Optionally, IMS may notify to the originating party a way to request itself to
be removed from being a UC source; example a telephone number or URL. The
notification is limited to IMS, for example an infected IMS terminal.
# 11 Conclusions and recommendations
Solutions, i.e. supplementary services based and IMR, for protecting IMS from
unsolicited communication (UC) were discussed in 3GPP SA3 working group.
Discussion in SA3 did not lead to agreement and thus conclusion on items that
should be standardized and at which level. However identification of origin of
calls was considered as a building block which maybe used in future 3GPP work.
