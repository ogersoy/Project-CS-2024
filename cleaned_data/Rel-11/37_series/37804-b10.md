# 4 Background
In Japan, "Action plan for frequency reorganization toward realizing Wireless
Broadband" was discussed in the Working Group (WG) under the ICT Policy Task
Force for a Global Era of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
(MIC). The WG concluded that 900 -- 905 MHz for UL and 945 -- 950 MHz for DL
will be allocated in 2011, and 10 MHz bandwidths will be added to the UL and
DL from 2012 if all progress smoothly. Eventually 900 -- 915 MHz for UL and
945 -- 960 MHz for DL will be allocated by 2015 (note: the reorganization may
not be completed in some geographical areas until 2015, however, assignment to
the areas will be completed by March 2018) [2]. Taking this plan into account,
the Telecommunications Council under the MIC studied technical conditions in
the 900 MHz band, and the final report was issued in May, 2011\. It should be
noted that these technical conditions are developed considering the co-
existence with the UMTS/LTE operation in the 800 MHz band, such as Bands 18
and 19/XIX.
Meanwhile, in Korea, the KCC (Korea Communications Commission) has re-
allocated the 800 MHz band (i.e., 839 -- 849 MHz for UL and 884 -- 894 MHz for
DL) and the 900 MHz band (i.e., 905 -- 915 MHz for UL and 950 -- 960 MHz for
DL) for IMT service. In order to investigate the impact of interference both
in UE and BS operating between these 800\~900 MHz bands, the SI "Interference
analysis between 800\~900 MHz bands" is ongoing in RAN4.
Since the possible new WI for the 900MHz band in Japan and the existing SI for
interference analysis between 800\~900 MHz bands in Korea are targeting for
similar frequency ranges, it would be useful to study the possibility of
harmonized WI proposal for these different band plans among these two
countries, before the possible new WI for the 900 MHz band in Japan is
established in the RAN#53.

## 4.1 Objective of the SI
The purpose of this work item is to:
\- Study the feasibility to add the Japanese technical conditions in the 900
MHz band to UMTS Band VIII
\- Study the feasibility to add the Japanese technical conditions in the 900
MHz band to LTE Band 8 considering the required A-MPR value and associated NS
signalling
\- Study the creation of a new UMTS/LTE Band to match the Japanese technical
conditions in the 900 MHz band
\- Study the possibility of a harmonized WI proposal for the different
frequency allocations in the 900 MHz ranges Japan and Korea
The Study Item description for New Study item proposal for 900MHz UMTS/LTE
operation was approved in RAN#52 [3].

### 5.1.2 Korean regulatory requirement
In June 2010, the KCC (Korea Communications Commission) had allocated 2x10MHz
bandwidth (UL: 839\~849MHz, DL: 884\~894MHz) of Band 5 to LG Uplus and 2x10MHz
bandwidth (UL: 905\~915MHz, DL: 950\~960MHz) of Band 8 to KT for IMT services
as shown in Figure 5.1.2-1.
{width="6.847222222222222in" height="2.36875in"}
Figure 5.1.2-1: The status of 800-900MHz band in Korea
As there is no technical requirement for unwanted emission between Band 5 and
Band 8 in TS25.101 and TS36.101, a technical regulation group, consisted of
KCC and operators (SKT, KT and LG Uplus), was formed under the control of KCC
in July 2010. The technical regulation group was responsible for making
domestic standards on unwanted emission requirements between Band 5 and Band
8. As there was no consensus among members of the study group in spite of
several meetings, KCC formed the technical expert committee organized with
professors and, member of government R&D centre, and all of the three
operators
KCC regulatory requirements had been discussed within technical expert
committee from December 2010. As there was, still no consensus made among
members of the technical expert committee, KCC made a tentative decision to
set for the strictest requirement for available for UE and BS requirement
based on field test. This tentative decision has been published in May 2011.
#### 5.1.2.1 Technical conditions for UTRA in Korea
900MHz spectrum has been awarded to KT for use of UTRA or E-UTRA in Korea. KT
will deploy E-UTRA in this spectrum and technical conditions for UTRA is not
needed to be studied in this study item.
#### 5.1.2.2 Technical conditions for E-UTRA in Korea
900MHz spectrum has been awarded to KT for use of UTRA or E-UTRA in Korea. KT
will deploy E-UTRA in this spectrum.
##### 5.1.2.2.1 Base Station (BS) requirements
Table 5.1.2.2.1-1 shows the BS Spurious emissions limits for Wide Area BS.
Korean regulatory specifies Wide Area BS as BS with transmission power of more
than +24dBm.

Above requirements had been acquired by actual field test on BS antennas. Two
different types of antenna had been used but only result from Omni antenna had
been considered for the evaluation. The distance between two antenna were set
as 2 meters as most of the BS deployment in Korea is likely to be located
within this distance. For this reason, 3GPP co-existence specification is not
likely to be applicable for BS deployment in Korea.
Since BS requirements are operator specific, BS vendors shall meet this
requirement in Korea. However, these Korean specific requirements are not
intended to be implemented in any of 3GPP Technical Specifications.
##### 5.1.2.2.2 UE to UE Coexistence requirements
Table 5.1.2.2.2-1 shows the UE to UE coexistence requirement between 900MHz UE
and 800MHz UE. Korean regulatory specifies maximum emission level to be
-30dBm/MHz.

# 7 General issues
## 7.1 Harmonization in the 900 MHz ranges Japan and Korea
For LTE deployment in Japan, only 5MHz and 10MHz are considered and 10MHz
deployment is limited to upper 10MHz (UL: 905-915MHz, DL: 950-960MHz).
Limiting UL RB allocation is considered for satisfying the Japanese protection
requirement of -40dBm/MHz.
For LTE deployment in Korea, 10MHz deployment is planned with the same range
as Japanese upper 10MHz deployment (UL: 905-915MHz, DL: 950-960MHz). Following
clauses will examine whether Band 8 can satisfy the Korean regulation
requirement of -30dBm/MHz.
The feasibility of using Band 8 LTE UE for both Japan and Korea is considered
in the following clauses.
# 8 Study of UTRA specific issues
## 8.1 Reuse of Band VIII for Japanese and/or Korean 900 MHz bands
### 8.1.1 Band VIII and 800 MHz band UE co-existence
There are 2 cases of co-existence between Band VIII UE and 800 MHz band in
Korea and Japan.
\- In Korea, Band V DL (869-894 MHz) needs to be protected from the UL in
905-915 MHz.
\- In Japan, Band XVIII DL (860-875 MHz) and XIX DL (875-890 MHz) need to be
protected from the UL in 900-915 MHz.
Assuming the typical minimum distance from the band edge for a carrier
frequency is 2.4 MHz, the minimum carrier spacing between the aggressor and
victim UEs is 14.8 MHz. Based on the model, which is verified by measuring an
actual PA device, the PA ACLR is approximated by an ACLR level of 36 dBc at 5
MHz offset and an ACLR slope of 13 dB/5 MHz for a single uplink carrier [10].
Approximating the minimum carrier spacing is 15MHz, thus, the ACLR term of 62
dBc/3.84MHz can be applicable. Assuming a 24 dBm R99 output power at antenna
port, the spurious emission is -38 dBm/3.84 MHz (=24-62). This is equivalent
to -43.8 dBm/1MHz for a single uplink. Furthermore, assuming the ACLR level at
5MHz is 33 dBc, which is specified as ACLR1 level in TS25.101, the spurious
emission becomes -40.8 dBm/1MHz in the same manner.
In addition, Band XIX DL protection from Band VIII UE is analysed using the
measurement results of commercially available PAs [11]. These PAs are
evaluated for ACLR1 under the condition by intentionally manipulating its
voltage bias with 33 dBc.

Figure 8.1.1-1 Power Amplifier Output Spectrum [11].
Figure 8.1.1 shows that typical PAs have at least 3.6 dB margin from Japanese
regulation of -37 dBm/1MHz.
In Japan, the spurious emission requirement is -37 dBm/1MHz in 800 MHz DL
bands (860-890 MHz), which can be achieved without any changes to hardware or
to software.
### 8.1.2 Band VIII and 800 MHz band BS co-existence
Figure 8.1.2-1 shows the summary of the frequency allocations of 900 MHz bands
in Japan and Korea, and the corresponding 3GPP bands.
{width="6.133333333333334in" height="2.5034722222222223in"}
Figure 8.1.2-1: Frequency allocations of 900 MHz bands in Japan and Korea, and
the corresponding 3GPP bands
With respect to the frequency allocations of 900 MHz bands in Japan and Korea,
the following issues on the co-existence between 800 MHz BS and 900 MHz BS
should be studied:
\- a-1) 900 MHz band BS blocking under the interference from 800 MHz band DL
\- b-1) Spurious emission power levels of 800 MHz band DL for protection of
900 MHz band UL
Here, the above co-existence issues a-1) and b-1) could be replaced with the
following if the design of the Rx filters for 900 MHz band BS in Japan and
Korea are equivalent to that of Band VIII BS:
\- a-2) Band VIII BS blocking under the interference from Band V/XIX DL
\- b-2) Spurious emission power levels of Band V/XIX BS for protection of band
VIII UL
Considering Band VIII UL is overlapping in Band V/XIX DL, the above co-
existence issues a-2) and b-2) could not be solved due to the little
attenuation of Rx filter for Band VIII BS in Band V/XIX DL.
However, the actual frequency allocations of 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands in
Japan and Korea are not overlapping Then the above co-existence issues a-1)
and b-1) could be solved through the following manner.
\- a-3) Expecting additional coupling loss by the site-engineering between 800
MHz band BS and 900 MHz band BS and/or additional attenuation by installing
the operator specific Rx filter.
\- b-3) Introducing the exception of spurious emission requirement of Band
V/XIX BS for protection of the not operated frequency range in Band VIII UL in
Japan and Korea.
As conclusion, the co-existence between 800 MHz band BS and 900 MHz band BS
would not be the issue on the feasibility to use UMTS band VIII in Japan and
Korea. However, whether the above regional solution should be captured in 3GPP
specification and, if necessary, how to capture this regional solution needs
to be further discussed.
## 8.2 Definition of a new band for Japanese and/or Korean 900 MHz bands
In Japan, use of UMTS Band VIII UE and BS for Japanese 900 MHz band is
feasible as described in the previous section. Therefore, consideration of a
new UMTS band for the Japanese 900 MHz band is not required.
# 9 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 9.1 Reuse of Band 8 for Japanese and/or Korean 900 MHz band
This section summarizes issues and additional requirements when Band 8 E-UTRA
UE/BS is to be operated under Japanese/Korean regulations.
### 9.1.1 Band 8 and 800 MHz band UE co-existence
#### 9.1.1.1 A-MPR and NS signalling addition for protection of 800MHz to Band
8 UE
In Japan, -40dBm/MHz will be required for a UE operating in 900MHz to protect
Band 18/19 as mentioned in 5.1.1.2.1(b). With Band 8 RF frontend, part of Band
19 spectrum is within the pass band of Band 8 Tx filter and it is impossible
to comply with the regulation. The introduction of appropriate A-MPR (and
relevant NS signalling) is a method to satisfy the protection requirement.
Study results were presented for A-MPR values required to be compliant with
the regulation[6, 7]:
