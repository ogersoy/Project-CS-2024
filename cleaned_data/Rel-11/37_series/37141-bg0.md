# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The minimum requirements are given in TS 37.104 [2] and the references
therein. Test requirements are given in this specification or are included by
reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS 25.142 [12], TS 36.141 [9] or TS 51.021 [11].
Test Tolerances for the test requirements explicitly stated in the present
specification are defined in Annex C of this specification. Test Tolerances
for test requirements included by reference are defined in the respective
referred test specification.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

\- If a multi-band BS supports three carriers only, two carriers shall be
placed in one band according to the relevant test configuration while the
remaining carrier shall be placed at the edge of the Maximum Radio Bandwidth
in the other band.
\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidths of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared Total RF Bandwidth of transmitter
and receiver for the declared band combinations of the BS, repeat the steps
above for test configurations where the Base Station RF Bandwidth of one of
the operating band shall be reduced so that the Total RF Bandwidth of
transmitter and receiver is not exceeded and vice versa.
\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carrier of each supported
operating bands in multi-band operation is larger than the declared total
number of supported carriers for the declared band combinations of the BS,
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall be
reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not exceeded and
vice versa.

highest band being tested for the BS.
\- If the maximum supported number of carriers is two for a BC2 band when the
BS supports CS4, CS5 or CS6, place the UTRA/E-UTRA carrier at the Base Station
RF Bandwidth edge adjacent to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and place the
GSM/EDGE carrier at the edge of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.
Narrowest supported E-UTRA channel bandwidth shall be used in the test
configuration.
\- If the maximum supported number of carriers is three or more for a BC2 band
when the BS supports CS4, CS5 or CS6, place one GSM/EDGE carrier at the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge adjacent to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, place the
second GSM/EDGE carrier at the edge of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth
and place the UTRA/E-UTRA carrier adjacent to the GSM/EDGE carrier at the
inter RF bandwidth gap. Narrowest supported E-UTRA channel bandwidth shall be
used in the test configuration. The adjacent UTRA/E-UTRA carrier shall be
placed with its channel BW edge aligned with the channel BW edge of the
GSM/EDGE carrier by applying F~offset,RAT ~in clause 4.4.2.

##### 4.8.7.2.2 TC7b power allocation
Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers equals
the rated total output power according to the manufacturer's declaration.
If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the declared
rated total output power of the operating band(s) in multi-band operation, the
exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other band(s). If
the power allocated for a carrier exceeds the rated carrier output power
declared for that carrier, the exceeded power shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other carriers.

band according to test case b) in TS 51.021 clause 6.12.2.
\- For the multi-RAT BC2 band, if the maximum supported number of carriers is
two, place the UTRA/E-UTRA carrier at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
adjacent to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, then place the GSM/EDGE carrier at the
other edge of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.
\- For the multi-RAT BC2 band, if the maximum supported number of carriers is
threeor more, place one GSM/EDGE carrier at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
adjacent to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, then place the second GSM/EDGE carrier
at the other edge of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth, then place the
UTRA/E-UTRA carrier in the middle of the Base Station RF Bandwidth.
> Repeat the steps above with the allocated carriers swapped between the two
> BC2 bands so that each BC2 band is tested once according to test case b) in
> TS 51.021 clause 6.12.2.
\- The narrowest supported E-UTRA channel bandwidth shall be used in the test
configuration.
\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared total bandwidth of transmitter and
receiver for the declared band combinations of the BS, repeat the steps above
for test configurations where the Base Station RF Bandwidth of one of the
operating band shall be reduced so that the Total RF Bandwidth of transmitter
and receiver is not exceeded and vice versa.
##### 4.8.7.3.2 TC7c power allocation
Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers equals
the rated total output power according to the manufacturer's declaration.
If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the declared
rated total output power of the operating band(s) in multi-band operation, the
exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other band(s). If
the power allocated for a carrier exceeds the rated carrier output power
declared for that carrier, the exceeded power shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other carriers.
## 4.9 RF channels and test models
### 4.9.1 RF channels
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range in the
operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and
T~RFBW~ (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ defined as following:
B~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
M~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. M~RFBW~ may be shifted
maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies to align carriers with the channel
raster.
T~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.
For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers to
test procedures defined in the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the
interpretation of the RF channels to be tested shall be according to the
definitions in the corresponding single-RAT specifications.
For BS capable of dual-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall
be performed at B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~_ T'~RFBW~: the Base Station RF Bandwidths located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the highest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the upper operating band.
\- B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW:~ the Base Station RF Bandwidths located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the lower operating band.
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ = B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the declared
Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans both operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ means the
Base Station RF Bandwidths are located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in the lower operating band and at the top of the supported
frequency range in the upper operating band.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supporting operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band
combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult
with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
### 4.9.2 Test models

HS-PDSCH transmission using 16QAM is supported also TM5 as defined in TS
25.141 [10] subclause 6.1.1.1, 6.1.1.4 and 6.1.1.4A whilst any remaining
carriers from other RAT(s) shall be configured according to a).
\- For the case that modulation accuracy is measured for UTRA TDD, the UTRA
TDD carriers shall be configured according to the supported modulation in
Table 6.2A, Table 6.39A, Table 6.39B, Table 6.39C, Table 6.39D, Table 6.40A,
Table 6.40B, Table 6.41A, Table 6.41B as defined in TS 25.142 [12] subclause
6.3.4, 6.8.1, 6.8.2 and 6.8.3 whilst any remaining carriers from other RAT(s)
shall be configured according to a). For BC3 CS3 BS testing, E-UTRA carriers

E-TM3.3 and E-TM2 as defined in TS 36.141 [9] subclause 6.1.1.4, 6.1.1.5,
6.1.1.6 and 6.1.1.3 whilst any remaining carriers from other RAT(s) shall be
configured according to a).
\- For the case that modulation accuracy is measured for GSM, the GSM carriers
shall be configured for the supported modulation according to TS 51.021 [11]
clause 6.2.2 whilst any remaining carriers from other RAT(s) shall be
configured according to a).
For the test of certain RF requirements clause 5 refers to the test
configurations as defined in the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the
transmitter test signals and test models as defined within the referred test
specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
## 4.10 BS configurations
### 4.10.1 Transmit configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics in clause 6 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.10.1-1: Transmitter test ports
#### 4.10.1.1 Transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in the case of
transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.
### 4.10.2 Receive configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics in clause 7 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.10.2-1: Receiver test ports
#### 4.10.2.1 Reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, receiver
diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity or in the
case of multi-carrier reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors.
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector (s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
For a multi-band BS, multi-band tests for blocking and intermodulation are
performed with the interferer(s) applied to each antenna connector mapped to
the receiver for the wanted signal(s), however only to one antenna at a time.
Antenna connectors to which no signals are applied are terminated.
### 4.10.3 Duplexers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted,
if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS.
NOTE: The present release of this specification does not contain test
requirements for the case that the duplexer is supplied as an option by the
manufacturer. This is left for future releases.
### 4.10.4 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 4.10.5 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF
amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting
network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and
the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the
manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the
attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation
value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the
applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.
When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to Table 4.10.5-1, where x denotes that
the test is applicable:
Table 4.10.5-1 Tests applicable to ancillary RF Amplifiers
* * *
Receiver Tests Subclause TX amplifier only RX amplifier only TX/RX amplifiers
combined (Note) 7.2 X X 7.4 X X 7\. 5 X X 7\. 6 x X 7\. 7 x  
Transmitter Tests 6.2 x X 6.6.1 X X 6.6.2 X x 6.6.3 X x 6.6.4 x X 6.7 x X
* * *
NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers
can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers
could be a passive network.
In test according to subclauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation
value is applied.
### 4.10.6 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the integrated
Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions according to clauses
6.6.4 and 7.7 shall be measured only for frequencies above 20MHz with the
integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.
### 4.10.7 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per transceiver). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least
one of the following conditions:
\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at more
than one antenna port; or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as
the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas (known
as \"aircombining\"); or
\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than one
antenna.
In case of diversity or spatial multiplexing, multiple antennas are not
considered as an antenna array.
If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an antenna system
which contains filters or active elements which are necessary to meet the BS
requirements, the conformance tests may be performed on a system comprising
the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for the purposes of
testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the performance of the
configuration under test is representative of the system in normal operation,
and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the BS is used with the
antenna system.
For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be used.
#### 4.10.7.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.10.7.1-1.
Figure 4.10.7.1-1: Receiver test set-up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 4.10.7.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna connectors
(Pi) shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals
the power of the test signal(s) (Ps) specified in the test. This may be
assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna connector
and summing the results, or by combining the signals and performing a single
measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the combining
network should be such that the power of the combined signal is maximised.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.10.7.2-1.
Figure 4.10.7.2-1: Transmitter test set-up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.
## 4.11 Format and interpretation of tests
Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:
**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
This subclause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or
only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer declarations may be included
here.
**X.2 Minimum requirement**
This subclause contains the reference to the subclause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.
**X.3 Test purpose**
This subclause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
**X.4.1 Initial conditions**
This subclause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-
up. For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers
to the test method of the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the initial
conditions as defined within the referred test specification for the RF
requirement shall be used.
**X.4.2 Procedure**
This subclause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. test port),
domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and
algorithms (e.g. averaging). For the test of certain RF requirements the
present specification refers to the test method of the single-RAT
specifications. In this case, the test procedure as defined within the
referred test specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
**X.5 Test requirement**
This subclause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test.
See subclause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. For the test of
certain RF requirements the present specification refers to the requirements
of the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the test requirement as
defined within the referred test specification for the RF requirement shall be
used.
## 4.12 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation. In the case of
multiband operation of a BS, single-RAT operation and the corresponding
applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined based
on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless otherwise
stated.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to each antenna connector.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to the antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting BC3 bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume synchronized operation, where
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
# 5 Applicability of requirements and test configurations
The present clause defines for each RF test requirement the set of mandatory
test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating conformance. This is
specified in the Table 5.2-1 for single-RAT Multi-carrier, and Table 5.1-1 for
multi-RAT Base Stations and Table 5.3-1 for multi-band capable Base Station.
Requirements apply according to the declared RAT Capability Set (CS) within
each supported operating band of the MSR Base Station and the Band Category of
the declared operating band (BC1, BC2 or BC3), as listed in the heading of
each table. Some RF requirements listed in the tables may not be mandatory or
they may apply only regionally. This is further specified for each requirement
in clause 6 and 7, and in Table 4.3-1.
For a declared RAT Capability Set (CS) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1, only the
requirements listed in the column for that CS apply. Requirements listed under
CS other than the declared CS(s) need not be tested.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous operation only, the test
configuration(s) in Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by a "C" and entries that
refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause
4.7.2 are identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation, the test
configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by "CNC" and entries that
refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause
4.7.2 are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation, the test
configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by "C/NC" and entries that
refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
For some of the RF test requirements entries within Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1
refer to the single-RAT specifications; this is denoted by \"(TS 25.141)\",
\"(TS 25.142)\", \"(TS 36.141)\" or \"(TS 51.021)\". In this case the
following shall apply:
\- transmitter test signals and test models as defined within the referred
test specification shall be used, see clause 4.9.2. For some RF requirements
this comprises a mandatory test case in addition to a test case using the MSR
test configurations defined in clause 4.8.
\- for some RF requirements the initial conditions and test procedure as
defined within the referred single-RAT test specification for the RF
requirement shall be used. This is specified in further detail in clauses 6, 7
and 8 of the present document.
\- for some RF requirements the test requirement as defined within the
referred single-RAT test specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
This is specified in further detail in clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the present
document. In this case (see clause 4.1):
\- The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
are defined in the respective referred test specification
\- Test Tolerances are defined in the respective referred test specification.
\- If the parameters in the manufacturer's declarations according to subclause
4.7.2 are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation, the
parameters for contiguous operation shall be used for the test in the single
RAT test specification.
For a BS declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the applicability of
the requirement for each operating band is determined by the RAT configuration
within that operating band as identified in Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1, unless
otherwise stated. The testing of multi-band capable BS shall be according to
Table 5.3-1 as follows:
\- For requirements test denoted by SBT (Single Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 shall be used for each operating
band depending on the RAT configuration within that band.
\- For requirements test denoted by MBT (Multi-Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in Table 5.3-1 shall be used depending on the Band Category
of the declared operating band combination.

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in subclause 4.10.
## 6.2 Base Station output power
### 6.2.1 Base Station maximum output power
#### 6.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
Output power of the Base Station is the mean power delivered to a load with
resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the transmitter.
The maximum total output power, P~max~, of the Base Station is the mean power
level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period in a
specified reference condition.
The maximum RAT output power, P~max,RAT~, of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific RAT in a specified reference condition.
The maximum carrier output power, P~max,c~ of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific carrier in a specified reference condition.
The rated carrier output power, P~Rated,c~, of the base station is the mean
power level for a specific carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal test
environment in Annex B.
The rated carrier output power of the BS shall be as specified in Table 6.2-1.
Table 6.2-1 Base Station rated carrier output power
* * *
BS class P~Rated,c~ Wide Area BS (note) Medium Range BS ≤+ 38 dBm Local Area
BS ≤+ 24 dBm NOTE: There is no upper limit for the rated carrier output power
of the Wide Area Base Station.
* * *
#### 6.2.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.2.1.
#### 6.2.1.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the accuracy of the maximum carrier output power
across the frequency range and under normal and extreme conditions for all
transmitters in the BS.
#### 6.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~
in single-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
In addition, a single test shall be performed under extreme power supply
conditions as defined in Annex B.3. In this case, it is sufficient to test on
a single combination of one ARFCN, UARFCN or E-ARFCN, one Base Station RF
Bandwidth position and with only one applicable test configuration defined in
clause 5.
NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply also test extreme temperature.
Connect the power measuring equipment to the MSR Base Station antenna
connector as shown in Annex D.1.1.
##### 6.2.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Measure the mean power for each carrier at the Base Station antenna
connector.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
3) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.2.1.5 Test requirements
In normal conditions, the measurement result in step 2 of subclause 6.2.1.4.2
shall for UTRA and E-UTRA remain:
within +2.7 dB and --2.7 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated carrier output power
for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz,
within +3.0 dB and --3.0 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated output power for
carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \ 3) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.6.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.6.1.5 Test requirements
The measurement result in step 2 of 6.6.1.4.2 shall not exceed the maximum
level specified in Table 6.6.1.5.1-1 to Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 if applicable for
the BS under test.
The test requirements of either subclause 6.6.1.5.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 6.6.1.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. In addition for a BS
operating in Band Category 2, the test requirements of 6.6.1.5.3 shall apply
in case of Category B limits.
##### 6.6.1.5.1 Spurious emissions (Category A)
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table

##### 6.6.1.5.4 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS
This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent the
receivers of Base Stations being desensitised by emissions from the BS
transmitter. It is measured at the transmit antenna port for any type of BS
which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table
6.6.1.5.4-1, depending on the declared Base Station class and Band Category.

Local Area BS BC1,BC2 F~UL_low~ -- F~UL_high~ -88 dBm 100 kHz
* * *
##### 6.6.1.5.5 Additional spurious emission requirements
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the
present document is given in subclause 4.4.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below. The power of any spurious emission shall not
exceed the limits of Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 for a BS where requirements for co-
existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of
multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of
Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in
Band 25 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 do not
apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink
operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). Emission limits for this excluded
frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table 4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-
existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements
are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and
10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.5.5-2: BS Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with
PHS
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 1884.5 ‑ 1915.7 MHz
-41 dBm 300 kHz Applicable for co-existence with PHS system operating in
1884.5-1915.7MHz NOTE: The requirement is not applicable in China.
* * *
The following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 41 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range
from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to
10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.5.5-3: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 41
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 2505MHz -- 2535MHz
-42dBm 1 MHz  
2535MHz -- 2630MHz -22dBm 1 MHz Applicable at offsets ≥ 250% of channel
bandwidth from carrier frequency 2630MHz -- 2655MHz -30dBm 1 MHz  
NOTE: This requirement applies for 10 or 20 MHz E-UTRA carriers allocated
within 2545-2575MHz.
* * *
In addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.1.5.1 to 6.6.1.5.4 and above
in the present subclause, the BS may have to comply with the applicable
emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [8], when deployed in regions
where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.
##### 6.6.1.5.6 Co-location with other Base Stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed
in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For
BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
column of Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the
co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [14].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table
4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the
same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
### 6.6.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band to the lower Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to 10 MHz above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink operating band. In addition, for
a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block
gap. In addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification,
except for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation. The
requirements in TS 45.005 [6] as defined in subclause 6.6.2.3 apply to an MSR
Base Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band
Category 2.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF Bandwidth gap are
not applicable.
#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.6.2.1, 6.6.2.2,
6.6.2.3 and 6.6.2.4.
#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the MSR BS, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.
#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test
For some of the test cases Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 refer to single-RAT
specifications; see clause 5. In this case the following shall apply:
\- For references to TS 25.141 [10], the method of test is specified in TS
25.141 [10], subclause 6.5.2.1.4.
\- For references to TS 25.142 [12], the method of test is specified in TS
25.142 [12], subclause 6.6.2.1.4.
\- For references to TS 36.141 [9], the method of test is specified in TS
36.141 [9], subclause 6.6.3.4.
NOTE: In this case the test requirements of the present document defined in
subclause 6.6.2.5 apply.
For GSM/EDGE single-RAT requirements, the method of test is specified in TS
51.021 [11], applicable parts of subclause 6.5.1, 6.5.2, 6.6.2 and 6.12.
For test requirements of operating band unwanted emissions using the MSR test
configurations defined in subclause 4.8, the, method of test described in
subclauses 6.6.2.4.1 and 6.6.2.4.2 applies.
##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~
in single-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
1) Connect the signal analyzer to the Base Station antenna connector as shown
in Annex D.1.1.
> As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
> should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
> measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and to avoid e.g. carrier
> leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
> bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
> bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in
> order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
2) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth. For BS operating in multiple bands or non-contiguous
spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be
measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF
Bandwidth or sub block edge.
3) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases with channel set-up according
to clause 5 and subclause 4.9.2.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.

#### 7.5.5.2 Co-location test requirements
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of BS
receivers when E-UTRA BS, UTRA, CDMA or GSM/EDGE operating in a different
frequency band are co-located with a BS.
The requirements in this subclause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between the
interfering transmitter and the BS receiver and are based on co-location with
base stations of the same class.
For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
parameters in Table 7.5.5.2-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
[5], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [4], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS
45.005 [6], Annex P.2.1.

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. In this
case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with
the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in subclause 6.6.1 are
valid.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported
on each antenna connector.
### 7.6.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 7.6.1.

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent the
maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within the
specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test report.
# B.3 Extreme test environment
The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:
1) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC
60721-3-3 [17] or ETSI EN 300 019-1-3 [19] (\"Stationary use at weather
protected locations\");
2) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC
60721-3-4 [18] or ETSI EN 300 019-1-4 [20] (\"Stationary use at non weather
protected locations\");
3) The equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the relevant
classes from IEC 60721 [16] documentation for Temperature, Humidity and
Vibration shall be declared.
NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall out side of the standard
operational conditions are not tested in the present document. These may be
stated and tested separately.
## B.3.1 Extreme temperature
When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum operating temperatures
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Minimum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60068-2-1 [21].
**Maximum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60068-2-2 [22].
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
# B.4 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test. This shall use
the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60068-2-6 [23]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in clause B.2.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
# B.5 Power supply
When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test shall
be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Upper voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60068-2-1 [21] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60068-2-2 [22]
Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
**Lower voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60068-2-1 [21] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60068-2-2 [22]
Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
# B.6 Measurement of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments shall be.
> Pressure: ±5 kPa.

> Relative Humidity: ±5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Test Tolerances and Derivation of test
requirements
The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification
using the Test Tolerances defined here. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the
test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum
requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the
following tables.
Test requirements which are included by reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS
25.142[12], TS 36.141[9] or TS 51.021[11] have been calculated within the
referred test specification using the Test Tolerances defined therein.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in subclause 4.1.2.
In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as
defined in this Annex.
