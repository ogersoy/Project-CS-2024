# Introduction
The concept of Precoded EGPRS2 -- PC EGPRS2 - DL has recently shown to provide
significant performance gains for EGPRS2. Gains are expected both in
interference and sensitivity limited scenarios, allowing significant increase
to both data capacity and spectral efficiency for EGPRS2.
Performing precoding of EGPRS2 modulated data is expected to increase
robustness of the system significantly while keeping the spectral properties
of the signal intact.

# 4 Objectives
## 4.1 Performance Objectives
### 4.1.1 Improved EGPRS2 throughput
The introduction of Precoded EGPRS2, PC EGPRS2, shall significantly improve
data throughput performance as compared to realistic EGPRS2 performance.
## 4.2 Compatibility Objectives
### 4.2.1 Spectral properties
PC EGPRS2 shall obey the current spectral requirements on spectrum due to
modulation and wideband noise and on switching transients of EGPRS2 DL[4].
### 4.2.2 Impact to legacy service
The impact of PC EGPRS2 on GSM speech codecs, GPRS, EGPRS and EGPRS2 shall be
kept at a minimum. Impact on cell reselection performance of mobile stations
should be avoided by operation of PC EGPRS2 on the BCCH carrier. Impacts from
PAN and USF multiplexing on PC-EGPRS2 and legacy user throughput should be
minimized.
### 4.2.3 Implementation impact to base stations
The introduction of Precoded EGPRS2 in the base station transmitter should
change BTS hardware as little as possible.
It is recommended for each candidate techinque to state compliance with Radix
size used in LTE up to 5 (e.g. 2, 3, 5) in the complexity evaluation in order
for the BTS to have an efficient implementation.
Note: SPEED TR will still open for other candidate techniques which are not
fulfilling such criterion.
### 4.2.4 Implementation impact to mobile station
The introduction of Precoded EGPRS2 in the mobile station receiver should
change MS hardware as little as possible. Both impact to stand-alone PC-EGPRS2
platforms and combined EGPRS2 and PC-EGPRS2 platforms shall be considered.
It is recommended for each candidate techinque to state compliance with Radix
size used in LTE up to 5 (e.g. 2, 3, 5) in the complexity evaluation in order
for the UE to have an efficient implementation.
Note: SPEED TR will still open for other candidate techniques which are not
fulfilling such criterion.
# 5 Common assumptions for the evaluation
In the following sub-clauses common assumptions for the performance evaluation
are listed
## 5.1 Overall design principles
### 5.1.1 Precoder module
The Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform shall be used as precoder module.
### 5.1.2 Burst length
The length of the active part of the burst (including current tail symbols) of
EGPRS2 shall be kept for PC EGPRS2, i.e.
\- EGPRS2-A: 148 NSR symbols
\- EGPRS2-B: 177 HSR symbols
### 5.1.3 Cyclic prefix
One cyclic prefix length, defined in duration of microseconds, is required.
When applied on PCE2-A and PCE2-B this duration must be translated to CP
lengths defined by normal and higher symbol rate symbols respectively.
### 5.1.4 Positioning of training symbols
To enable easier detection of the precoded bursts only a single positioning
vector of training symbols onto the burst for the respective EGPRS2 level will
be applied, i.e. one for PC EGPRS2-A and one for PC EGPRS2-B.
### 5.1.5 Modulation and coding scheme
All channel coding definitions of EGPRS2 shall be kept intact with regards to
payload size, channel coding and interleaving, except for the highest MCS of
each set, i.e. DAS-10/11/12 and DBS-10/11/12 for EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B, where
only the payload size is required to be kept.
#### 5.1.5.1 Modulation scheme
In addition to the modulation schemes defined in [4] for EGPRS2, BPSK and
64QAM can be used for the mapping of bits onto modulation symbols in the
burst.
The definition of the additional modulation schemes are shown in Figure 5.1.

# 5a Concept description
In this sub clause an overall concept description of each proposed candidate
techniques is given.
The description is based on the design used in the analysis on _Impact to base
station and mobile station_ (Section 6.6) and in the section on _Comparison of
PC EGPRS2 with EGPRS2 performance_ (Section 8).
The TR can also contain other design alternatives within the same candidate
technique. However, these have not been used for the final proposal of each
respective candidate technique.
## 5a.1 Single Block Precoded EGPRS2 -- SBPCE2
Single Block Precoded EGPRS2 introduces an IDFT precoder module in the
transmitter chain to form a single OFDM symbol modulated upon the GSM carrier
frequency. Since only a precoder module is inserted in the transmitter chain
the useful part of the burst is still pulse shaped as in legacy operation,
keeping the spectral properties of the signal.
The IDFT is applied to both payload and TSC symbols in the burst. Conventional
tail symbols used for up/down ramp and providing known states for the
termination of the trellis search are discarded, and, instead these symbols
are used to add a cyclic prefix to the transmitted OFDM symbol to keep the
orthogonality of the transmitted sub carriers, taking the added time
dispersive nature of Tx/Rx filters and channel propagation into account.
By applying the precoder module in the transmitter the Peak-to-Average (PAR)
of the signal is significantly increased, and stochastic in nature, compared
to the deterministic PAR characteristics of EGPRS2. In order to reduce the PAR
without adding clipping distortion to the signal, a rotation based PAR
reduction is applied where the TSC symbols and half of the data symbols are
rotated. A predetermined set of rotation angles are used and for each burst
the most suitable rotation angle is chosen. Rotation based PAR reduction is
only applied to DBS-11b/12b since for lower MCSs the SINR operating range of
the MCSs increases the detection error of the rotation and thus degrades
performance, see subclause 6.4.1.
The number of total symbols in the burst has been kept, to the farthest extent
possible, similar to the legacy EGPRS2 burst format while still finding a DFT
size suitable for efficient FFT operations. The DFT sizes used for level A and
B is 144 and 162 respectively to enable FFT Radix size of two and three, see
subclause 6.2.1.1.
Since the tail symbols are discarded, and with an IDFT size of 144 for level
A, a ramp function is applied to the signal, as decribed in Section 6.2.7.1,
to comply with the normal burst duration and preserve spectrum due to
switching transients, see subclause 6.2.7.1.
For level B the IDFT size of 162 will reduce the OFDM symbol duration and thus
a longer CP has been added compared to the one used for level A, see 6.2.2.1.
Mixed modulations in the burst have been investigated as a means to keep the
bit energy constant over the burst, despite suppression from the Tx filter on
the edge carriers. It was found that the gains were depending on scenario
investigated and thus it has not in general been applied to the design.
However, with the chosen DFT size of 162 for level B a certain amount of
modulation mix has been applied together with a reduced TSC length, compared
to the 32 symbols currently used for EGPRS2-B, see subclause 6.2.5.1 and
6.2.1.1.
To improve performance of the higest MCSs in each respective EGPRS2 set, 64QAM
modulation is used for MCSs (DAS-10b/11b/12b and DBS-10b/11b/12b). Further, to
improve coderate, the number of TSC/pilot symbols has been reduced to 16 for
these MCSs, see subclause 6.1.1.1.4.
The channel coding definitions, of the MCSs in terms of SF, USF, PAN, Payload
and Header have been kept intact for all MCSs except for the three highest in
each set where the rate of the channel coding for the payload have been
reduced, while keeping the payload size. Also, rate matching and interleaving
have been optimized for the highest MCSs.
The burst mapping has been modified with the TSC symbols evenly spread over
sub carriers not significantly suppressed by the transmit pulse shape while
for sub carriers attenuated at the carrier bandwidth edge, consecutive
tranining/pilot symbols are used to improve channel estimation and
equialization.
In order for the receiver to blindly detect the modulation used in the burst,
a predefined set of circular shifts of the TSC symbol vector is performed, see
6.3.1.
To keep the performance of USF and the relative performance of SF/Header to
data intact, the currently defined mapping of bits in each half burst is
circularly shifted. The shift is different depending on the MCSs used and is
performed to map the USF/SF/Header fields on stronger sub channels than what
is achieved with the current EGPRS2 mapping. Also, bit swapping is applied to
place the SF/Header bits, and the USF bits for 8PSK, on strong bit positions
in the burst (for higher order modulations the USF bits are mapped to full
symbols, as is done for EGPRS2), see subclause 6.2.4.1.
The design of Single Block EGPRS2 described in this sub clause, is captured in
table 5a.1-1 and table 5a.1-2 for SBPCE2-A and SBPCE2-B respectively.

* Main modulation
## 5a.2 Padded Higher Order Modulation-- Padded HOM
Padded HOM introduces a Symbol swapping and an IDFT precoder module in the
transmitter chain to form a single OFDM symbol modulated upon the GSM carrier
frequency. The pulse shaping and the spectral properties of the signal are
kept intact for legacy EGPRS2.
Symbol swapping module swaps half burst symbol's position to ensure the
performance of USF and Header in a simple way, see subclause 6.2.4.2.
One level higher order modulation is utilized for each coding scheme so that
only a portion of symbols are needed to carry the same amount of payload. The
padded symbols are introduced and could be arranged at the edges of the signal
bandwidth to adapt to the intact total symbol numbers for the burst. The
padded symbols have different choices. Zero-padded symbols are used for the
final design evaluation. For the re-designed MCS DAS-10b/11b/12b v1/v2 and
DBS-10b/11b/12b v1/v2, no padded symbols are ultilized.
In order to achieve high efficient FFT/IFFT implementation and comply with
radix size used in LTE up to 5, the DFT length used for level A and B is 144
and 162 respectively, see subclause 6.2.1.2.
Conventional tail symbols are discarded and instead these symbols are used to
add a cyclic prefix. With the DFT length of 144 for level A, some change in
ramping is applied to the signal, see subclause 6.2.7.1.
For level B the DFT length of 162 will reduce the OFDM symbol duration and
thus a longer CP has been added compared to the one used for level A, see
6.2.2.2.
Different TS lengths with corresponding number of padded symbols have been
investigated to improve the performance for Padded HOM. The number of TS
symbols has been reduced to 17/18 for level-A and level-B MCSs except the
three higest MCSs in each respective EGPRS2 set. The position of the TS
symbols is evenly spread over the whole burst, see subclause 6.2.3.2.
In order for the receiver to blindly detect the modulation used in the burst a
predefined set of circular shifts of the TS symbol vector is performed, see
6.3.1.
To improve performance of the highest MCSs in each respective EGPRS2 set,
64QAM modulation is used for MCSs (DAS-10b/11b/12b and DBS-10b/11b/12b). To
improve the coderate, the number of TS symbols has been further reduced to
14/13 for these MCSs, see subclause 6.1.1.2.
The channel coding definitions of the MCSs in terms of SF, USF, PAN, Payload
and Header have been kept intact for all MCSs except for the three highest in
each set where the coderate of the channel coding for the payload have been
reduced, while keeping the payload size intact.Furthermore, the puncturing and
interleaving parameters of the three highest MCSs in each set have been re-
searched, see subclause 6.1.1.2.
To optimize the performance of USF and the relative performance of SF/Header
to data intact the currently defined mapping of bits to the burst is
circularly shifted and bit swapping is applied for the three highest MCSs in
each respective EGPRS2 set, depending on the MCSs used, see subclause 6.1.1.2.
The design of Padded HOM described in this sub clause, is captured in table
5a.2-1 and table 5a.2-2 for Padded HOM-A and Padded HOM-B respectively.

# 6 Design and Evaluation
## 6.1 Re-design of DAS-10b/11b/12b/DBS-10b/11b/12b
A re-definition of DAS-10/11/12 and DBS-10/11/12 for EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B
respectively is foreseen in order to optimize performance. The payload size of
each MCS, i.e. 2x82, 3x68, 3x82 bytes and 3x74, 4x68 and 4x74 bytes for
DAS-10/11/12 and DBS-10/11/12 respectively are to be kept.
This sub-clause evaluates modifications in the MCS design and its impact on
performance.
### 6.1.1 Burst formatting and channel coding
In the sub clauses below a re-design of DAS-10/11/12 and DBS-10/11/12 is
proposed. These new redesigned MCSs have been denoted DAS-10b/11b/12b and
DBS-10b/11b/12b in this technical report.
Two designs of DAS-12b and DBS-12b are presented, and denoted v1 and v2. The
difference between the two designs is the number of TSC symbols used. DAS-12b
and DBS-12b v1 is used in this document, unless otherwise stated, while
DAS-12b v2 and DBS-12b v2 is used in the final performace evalution in Sub
clause 8.
#### 6.1.1.1 Burst formatting for Single Block PCE2
##### 6.1.1.1.1 Introduction
This sub-clause proposes a new burst formatting design for DAS-10b/11b/12b and
DBS-10b/11b/12b for Single Block PCE2 in terms of
  * Mapping of bits onto modulation symbols and
  * Burst mapping of Header and Data fields.
For the mapping of bits onto modulation symbols the objective is to find the
best mixed mode modulation combination for the studied MCSs in terms of
optimal throughput performance.
**For the** burst mapping of Header and Data fields the objective is to derive
  * header bit swapping, which swaps header bits at weak positions with > data bits at strong positions and
  * burst bit shifting, which circularly shifts each half burst so that > part of, or all header bits end up at higher SNR **region,**
to achieve robust header and incremental redundancy performance.
The evaluation in section 6.1.1.1.2 and 6.1.1.1.3 was for simplicity only
performed for DAS-12b and DBS-12b, as it was shown in [6.1-9] that the derived
designs are robust enough to be applied also to DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and
DBS-10b/11b/12b v2.
##### 6.1.1.1.2 Evaluation Method
Several best MMM candidates are first derived, in terms of providing as robust
performance as possible at lower SNR region, which will later lead to robust
data performance when header bit swapping and shifting is used. This
evaluation is done by placing all header/USF/SF bits at high SNR region, and
focusing therefore on the data BLER performance.
The header bit swapping and shifting are then evaluated together with the best
MMM candidates. The best burst formatting for DAS-12b and DBS-12b is then
selected as the one that keeps the relative performance between header and
data BLER (using non-precoded DAS-12 (data BLER\@50% to avoid error floor and
headerBLER\@1%) and DBS-11(data BLER\@10% and headerBLER\@1%) as reference),
meanwhile achieves as low data BLER as possible.
For more information please refer to [6.1-2].
##### 6.1.1.1.3 Simulation Assumptions and Results
###### 6.1.1.1.3.1 Simulation Assumptions
The selection of the optimal burst formatting, including MMM, header bit
swapping and shifting is based on performance simulated in a sensitivity
limited scenario given a TU50nFH propagation environment. The data and header
BLER are then verified in other propagation models and interference scenarios.
A detailed list of simulation assumptions are presented in table 6.1-1.

###### 6.1.1.1.3.2 Simulation Results
Evaluation according to 6.1.1.2 shows that the best burst formatting is:
  * For DAS-12b: MMM pattern containing 56 64QAM symbols, one 32QAM and > one 8PSK symbol, with header bit swapping and a right shift of 50 > bits;
  * for DBS-12b: no MMM, with header bit swapping and no shifting.
Simulation results are listed in table 6.1.1-2 and table 6.1.1-3.

It can be seen that the use of header bit swap and burst shift significantly
improves the header performance of DAS-12b and DBS-12b, up to 17dB, meanwhile,
the data performance has degraded moderately, in almost all the simulated
scenarios. It should also be noticed that, for DAS-12b, the use of MMM
decreases the degradation in data performance due to header bit swapping and
shifting.
#### 6.1.1.1a TSC symbol position for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b/12b
v2 for SBPCE2
##### 6.1.1.1a.1 Introduction
In EGPRS2-A and EGPRS2-B the TSC lengths were chosen to secures accurate
receiver channel estimation to facilitate synchronization, ISI suppression and
equalization. As SBPCE2 introduces a new air interface, where e.g.
orthogonality between adjacent symbols is granted by the introduction of a
cyclic prefix, it is not necessarily true that the EGPRS2 TSC lengths are
optimal for SBPCE2. In the following an empirical method is described that is
designated to investigate the optimal TSC length for SBCPE2-A DAS-10b/11b/12b
v2 and Low Complexity SBPCE2-B DBS-10b/11b/12b v2. For detailed information
see [6.1-9].
The method is based on a search for a TSC vector _TSC(T,cn,sp)_ of length _T_
and defined by a number _cn_ of symbols located in the centre of the burst and
a number _T-cn_ of symbols evenly distributed over the remains of the burst,
starting at position _sp_ , as illustrated in Figure 6.2-4.
The task is to find the best TSC vector, offering optimum performance for
DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b/12b v2, among the set of TSC positing
vectors _TSC(T,cn,sp)_ defined by:
##### 6.1.1.1a.2 Evaluation Method
To find the best TSC vector the Data and Header BLER performance for each TSC
positing vector _TSC(T,cn,sp)_ was evaluated for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and
DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 given TU50noFH propagation conditions and;
  * Sensitivity limited,
  * Co-channel interference limited and
  * Adjacent channel interference limited scenarios.
During the evaluations simulation settings according to Table 6.1-4 was used.
For each evaluated TSC length new puncturing patterns and interleaver schemes
were derived, using a best guess value on interleaver parameter _a_ and the
puncturing _swap_ parameter set to 0. Header definitions were in accordance

The achieved performance for each MCS and scenario was compared with the
reference performance achieved when utilizing the optimum TSC positioning
vector found in subclause 6.2.3.1 and Table 6.2-5a. The relative performance
at 10% Data BLER was used as metric to identify the best TSC vector
_TSC(T,cn,sp)_ for each MCS. Table 6.1-4a shows the results for the best TSC
vector _TSC(16,4,7)_ for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2. Gains are observed in all
scenarios. The same was true for DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 where _TSC(16,4,7)_ gave
best performance, and gains on all scenarios except for DBS-10b when exposed
to adjacent interference.

The improvement in Data BLER, seen in Table 6.1-4a, is achieved by a decreased
Data code rate. As the Header block code is unaffected by the choice of
_TSC(T,cn,sp)_ it must be verified that the improved data performance is not
achieved at the expense of an unacceptable degradation in header performance.
In Table 6.1-4b it is shown that the relative header performance degradation
for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 is limited. The same is true for DBS-10b/11b/12b v2
header performance.

##### 6.1.1.1a.3 Verification and Conclusion
To secure that the performance gains were not limited to TU50nFH propagation
conditions the choice of TSC vectors _TSC(16,4,7)_ for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and
DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 was verified in the following scenarios:
  * Es/N0, TU50nFH,
  * Es/N0, HT100nFH,
  * Es/N0, RA250nFH,
  * C/I~CO~, TU3iFH and
  * C/I~ADJ~, TU3iFH
Table 6.1-4c summarizes, in similarity to Table 6.1-4a, the relative
performance improvement at 10% Data BLER for each of the evaluated MCSs in the
listed set of interference and sensitivity limited scenarios. Gains are
observed in all scenarios except for DBS-10b in the C/I~ADJ~, TU3iFH
evaluation. This confirms the conclusion that _TSC(16,4,7)_ was the best
choice for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b/12b v2.

#### 6.1.1.1b Puncturing and Interleaver design for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and
DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 for SBPCE2
##### 6.1.1.1b.1 Introduction
Sub-clause 6.1.1.1.4 presents a proposal to reduce the TSC length and decrease
the code rate for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 to achieve
throughput gains at high SINR levels. During the evaluations performed [6.1-9]
to derive the results presented in sub-clause 6.1.1.1.4 the optimization of
puncturing patterns and interleaver schemes were left for further study. In
this sub-clause the evaluation is made complete as a search for optimal
puncturing patterns and interleaver schemes is performed. For detailed
information see [6.1-10].
##### 6.1.1.1b.2 Evaluation Method
The EGPRS2 puncturing pattern and interleaver scheme design are based on the
_swap_ and _a_ design parameters. To derive optimal _swap_ and _a_ parameters
for each of DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 the method outlined in
[6.1-7] was followed, i.e. to
  * Simulate incremental redundancy Data BLER performance for a range of _swap_ values, given an initial best guess of the _a_ parameter value.
  * Select the best _swap_ value and simulate first transmission Data BLER performance over a range of feasible _a_ values for the chosen interleaver type.
In the evaluation Interleaver type 1 was used since it is typically used for
EGPRS2 MCS with low code rate and secures a good spread of bits over the
entire radio block as well as within each burst. It restricts _a_ to take on a
value less than the number of data bits per burst, _N~b~_ , and prohibits _a_
to have factors common to _N~b~_.
Table 6.1-4d lists the code rate for each of the targeted MCSs along with the
applied interleaver type and the required number of puncturing patterns.

The simulations were performed for TU50nFH and TU3nFH channels which are
believed to correspond to typical propagation conditions, while covering
scenarios where high as well as low fading diversity can be expected. Table
6.1-4e presents a detailed summary of the simulation assumptions.

##### 6.1.1.1b.3 Puncturing design
Incremental redundancy performance was evaluated for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and
DBS-10b/11b/12b v2. Figure 6.1 shows the performance for DAS-12b and DBS-12b
RV 1, 2 and 3 over the range of selected _swap_ values, simulated for TU50nFH
and TU3nFH, relative the performance achieved for the best choice of _swap_.
Reference [6.1-10] presents similar results for DAS-11b/10b and DBS-11b/10b.

To optimize incremental redundancy performance, and minimize the total
degradation computed over the simulated scenarios, it was concluded that swap
equal to 0% shall be used for DAS-11b/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b while swap equal
5% is the best choice for DAS-10b and DBS-12b v2. Table 6.1-4f summarizes the
results.

##### 6.1.1.1b.4 Interleaver design
The first transmission Data BLER performance was, for each studied MCS,
evaluated over a range of _a_ values as defined in Table 6.1-4e, at a fixed
Es/N0 corresponding to approximately 10% Data BLER. The puncturing _swap_
parameter was set in accordance to the findings in sub-clause 6.1.1.1.5.3.
Figure 6.2 below shows the performance for DAS-12b v2 and DBS-12b v2 over the
entire range of _a_ values, simulated for TU50nFH and TU3nFH, relative the
performance achieved for the best choice of _a_. As the resulting performance
from the TU50nFH and TU3nFH simulations were strongly correlated an average
value of the relative performance was selected as metric in the search for the
optimal choice of _a_. Reference [6.1-10] presents similar results for
DAS-11b/10b and DBS-11b/10b.

type 1 a parameter for TU50nFH and TU3nFH propagation conditions.
The optimal _a_ value for each MCS was identified as the value offering the
lowest metric, i.e. the best average performance over the simulated scenarios.
As DAS-11b and DAS-12b v2 have same data block size they can for simplicity be
equipped with identical interleaver schemes. The same principle applies to
DBS-11b and DBS-12b v2. A summary of the best _a_ value, given the condition
that DAS-11b and DAS-12b v2 as well as DBS-11b and DBS-12b v2 shall have
identical interleavers, is presented in Table 6.1-4g.

##### 6.1.1.1b.5 Conclusion
This section presents an investigation of interleaver and puncturing design
for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 based on EGPRS2 Interleaver type
1 a and puncturing swap parameters. Optimal values for the studied parameters
have been found through a search over a range of feasible a and selected swap
values given TU50nFH and TU3nFH propagation conditions in a sensitivity
limited scenario. Table 6.1-4f and 6.1-4g summarizes the findings.
The results from these investigations show that the SBPCE2 performance is
robust over a range of puncturing swap and interleaver a parameter values. It
is thus concluded that the results from earlier investigations, performed for
SBPCE2, where swap has been set to 0% and arbitrary a values have been used,
can be considered as robust.
#### 6.1.1.2 Coding parameters and burst formatting for Padded HOM
##### 6.1.1.2.1 Design assumptions
  * 64QAM modulation is used over the whole burst for the new MCSs DAS-10b/11b/12b and DBS-10b/11b/12b.
  * The same Header, USF and SF definitions for DAS-10/11/12 and DBS-10/11/12 respectively are to be kept.
  * The length of the Training Sequence in the burst could be different from DAS-10/11/12 and DBS-10/11/12.
  * The mother code and rate matching algorithms are kept the same as EGPRS2 described in TS 45.003 chapter 5.1a.1.3. The interleaver Type1 defined in TS45.003 5.1a.2.1 is used in this study.
Therefore the coding design of the puncturing and interleaving algorithms is
limited to determine the rate matching parameter _swap_ and the interleaver
parameter _a_.
##### 6.1.1.2.2 Design Method
A set of different TS lengths and corresponding best choice of rate matching
and interleaver parameters are first derived.
The RV1 Data BLER performances with different TS lengths under the selected
coding parameters are evaluated in different propagations and interference
scenarios. After comprehensive comparison the TS length 12 symbols for DAS-12b
and 13 symbols for DBS-12b are selected.
Burst shift and bit swapper according to [6.1-8] are utilized in searching the
best burst format. Based on the performance evaluations, it is shown that the
best burst format for DAS-12b is header bit swapping and shifting of 88 bits.
And the best format for DBS-12b is header bit swapping and shifting of 54
bits. This version of re-design MCSs could be denoted v1 or no version
indication is given, unless otherwise stated.
For more information please refer to [6.1-6].
For Low complexity Padded HOM, the re-designed MCSs have been denoted v2. The
TS length 14 and 13 symbols are proposed for DAS-10b/11b/12b v2 and
DBS-10b/11b/12b v2 respectively.

## 6.2 Burst format
### 6.2.1 DFT length
The length of the Discrete Fourier Transform - DFT -- has a direct relation to
the computational complexity and also the sub-carrier spacing, which will have
impact on performance.
This sub-clause evaluates different DFT sizes, both in terms of computational
complexity and performance.
#### 6.2.1.1 Choice of DFT lengths for Single Block PCE2
At the normal symbol rate, a reasonable choice of {width="0.19375in"
height="0.19375in"}, the DFT size, is {width="1.8888888888888888in"
height="0.19375in"}, since this length yields the same payload and training
symbols as EGPRS/EGPRS2-A. Unfortunately {width="0.19375in"
height="0.19375in"} is not a highly composite number since 71 is a prime
number. The choice {width="1.9583333333333333in" height="0.19375in"}is
proposed since FFT's of size 144 are typically 3 to 10 times faster than FFT's
of size 142, depending on implementation details and hardware capabilities.
This also gives two extra symbols that can be used for training or other
purposes. Although the sub-carrier spacing for {width="0.5965277777777778in"
height="0.19375in"} is a little smaller than for {width="0.5965277777777778in"
height="0.19375in"}, the difference in performance between the two FFT lengths
is negligible.
At the higher symbol rate, a reasonable choice of {width="0.19375in"
height="0.19375in"} is{width="1.9166666666666667in" height="0.19375in"}, which
gives the same payload and training symbols as EGPRS2-B. A more convenient
value from the computational point of view is{width="1.7361111111111112in"
height="0.19375in"}. This last value is obtained by the elimination of one
training symbol. Although the sub-carrier spacing for
{width="0.5965277777777778in" height="0.19375in"} is a little larger than
for{width="0.5965277777777778in" height="0.19375in"}, and even though one
training symbol is removed, the difference in performance between the two DFT
lengths is negligible. A further reduction in computational complexity is
achieved by choosing an FFT size of {width="1.7361111111111112in"
height="0.19375in"}.
This design is in the following sub clauses and in the remainder of the TR
referred to as 'Low complexity SBPCE2B', see [6.2-10] for more details. If Low
complexity SBPCE2B is not explicitly referred to SBPCE2B is assumed to be
based on the design with an FFT size of 168.
As the Low complexity SBPCE2B FFT size is reduced, the modulation order needs
to be increased, as shown in table 6.2-0, in order for the Low complexity
SBPCE2B radio block to maintain its payload capacity.

Table 6.2-0a lists the TSC length and payload size of the investigated SBPCE2B
burst formats. To accommodate a total burst size of 162 the number of TSC
symbols has been reduced to 26 symbols for DBS-5-9 resulting in a payload size
of 136 symbols. The Low complexity SBPCE2B TSC length of 26 symbols for
DBS-5-9 enables a re-use of the TSC set defined for EGPRS2-A. DBS-10b/11b/12b
allows more flexibility in the TSC length which has been investigated in-depth
in section 6.1.1.1.4.

##### 6.2.1.1.1 Performance Evaluation of DFT lengths
Figures 6.2-1 and 6.2-2 show that a DFT of size 144 for normal symbol rate and
168 for higher symbol rate can be adopted without link performance losses with
respect to the sizes 142 and 169 respectively.
Simulation assumptions include TX and RX impairments from [6.2-1] TSC
positioning based on [6.2-3] and using an RX bandwidth of 240 kHz and 275 kHz
for PCE2-A and PCE2-B respectively.

The performance impact on reducing the size of the FFT from 168 to 162 by
utilizing a shorter TSC and increasing the modulation order is listed in table

SBPCE2B and Low complexity SBPCE2B is typically 0.5 dB or less for most of the
investigated scenarios.

#### 6.2.1.2 DFT length for Padded HOM
##### 6.2.1.2.1 Principle of DFT length choices
For the normal case, the DFT size is determined primarily by the number of
user data symbols, the number of training symbols and some special symbols
(such as padding symbols at the edge of the signal BW). Considering the
efficient of DFT algorithm and the impact on other parts, the final DFT length
should be carefully designed.
At the normal symbol rate, a common choice of N, the DFT size, is N = 142 =
116+26=2*71. Unfortunately N is not a highly composite number since 71 is a
prime number, which will result in high algorithm complexity both in BTS and
MS. So is the N=169=138+31=13*13 at the higher symbol rate.
A good way to achieve highly efficient DFT is to find a number which is highly
composite number with the small prime numbers, such as 2,3,5,7. At the same
time, the change of the DFT size would have little impact on the functionality
of other parts of burst and the performance. The DFT sizes, N = 140 = 2*2*5*7
and N = 144 =2*2*2*2*3*3 are both candidates at the normal symbol rate.
Compared to DFT size N = 142 the increased DFT size N = 144 will result in
even narrower sub-carrier bandwidth which may bring some frequency offset
sensitivity issues. Since the total duration of the burst is kept intact and
it is determined by the guard period, data symbols, CP, training symbols and
other special symbols (if exists), if keeping the guard period, the CP length
will be shortened because of the increased DFT size. It is not expected
especially for the large delay spread channel. At the higher symbol rate, the
DFT size N=168=2*2*2*3*7 is an appropriate highly composite number close to
169.
According to above considerations, a reasonable choice of DFT size N
=140=2*2*5*7 is recommended for NSR and N =168=2*2*2*3*7 for HSR, shown in
Table 6.2-2. This DFT size can be easily obtained by removing 2(for NSR) or
1(for HSR) padding symbols in Padded HOM (reference to the section 6.2.5.2).
In order to further reduce computational complexity of FFT/IFFT implementation
and comply with radix size used in LTE up to 5, alternative DFT sizes of N=144
for NSR and N=162=2*3*3*3*3 for HSR are also proposed for Padded HOM.
In the following sub clauses and in the remainder of the TR this alternative
DFT sizes design is referred to as 'Low complexity Padded HOM'. If Low
complexity Padded HOM is not explicitly stated, Padded HOM is assumed to be
based on the design with DFT sizes of 140 and 168.

##### 6.2.1.2.2 Performance evaluations for the DFT length
Figure 6.2-3 shows that the DFT size of 140 (for NSR) and 168 for HSR can be
adopted without link performance losses compared to the DFT sizes 142 and 169
respectively. The simulation assumptions are depicted in Table 6.2.1.2-4.

### 6.2.2 CP length
A cyclic prefix is needed to mitigate the impact from channel time dispersion,
on PC EGPRS2 performance.
This sub-clause evaluates different CP lengths.
#### 6.2.2.1 Choice of CP length for Single Block PCE2
The CP introduces overhead, but also helps reduce the complexity of the
demodulator. In order to keep both the duration of the PCE2 time slot, the
length of the DFT and maintain the guard period as in EGPRS2, the following
values are proposed.
Table 6.2-3 CP length for PCE.
* * *
Symbol rate CP duration [μs] Normal 6*48/13 Higher 9*40/13 Higher, low
complexity 15*40/13
* * *
The proposed duration of the CP covers the time dispersion due to the Tx/Rx
filters, as well as the time dispersion found in the most common propagation
environments (except for Hilly Terrain).
#### 6.2.2.2 Choice of CP length for Padded HOM
In order to keep the duration of the burst intact and maintain the guard
period, the CP length will be increased from 6 symbols to 8 symbols when the
DFT size is decreased from 142 to 140, as described in section 6.2.1.2.1. The
CP length defined in duration of microseconds, given in Table 6.2-4, is very
close for NSR and HSR (with only a difference of 1.8us).
For Low complexity Padded HOM, the CP length of 6 symbols and 15 symbols for
NSR and HSR are proposed.

### 6.2.3 TSC symbol position
This sub-clause evaluates different positioning of the training symbols for
improved performance.
#### 6.2.3.1 TSC symbol position for Single Block PCE2
In Precoded EGPRS2 [6.2-1], the channel estimate is performed based on the
training symbols, which are spread over the transmitted burst. To achieve good
quality of the channel estimate and increased throughput, the placement of the
training symbols should be carefully designed.
In the following sub-clauses two design criteria are presented and evaluated
to find best the placement of the training symbols,
##### 6.2.3.1.1 Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) criterion
Under the MMSE criterion, a good training symbol placement
$\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{opt}}}$is the one that minimizes the mean
square error of the channel estimate:
where ${\hat{\lambda}}_{i}$is the channel frequency response estimate for the
$i$-th symbol.
Given Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and flat fading channel, the
optimal training symbol placement based on MMSE criterion are those that are
equally spaced. The training symbol indices can be calculated by:
$\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{uniform}}}(\text{sp}) = \text{sp} +
\left\lfloor \frac{L}{\text{Ntr}}\left\lbrack 0:1:\text{Ntr} - 1 \right\rbrack
\right\rfloor$,
with L the DFT size, $\text{Ntr}$ the training sequence length,
and$\text{sp}$the index of the first training symbol.
##### 6.2.3.1.2 Balance Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) criterion
Due to the low-pass characteristic of a GSM/EDGE channel, the instantaneous
SNR for symbols transmitted at the edge of the frequency band in a PCE2 burst
will always be lower than that for those transmitted in the middle of the
frequency band. By placing training symbols at different positions, the
instantaneous SNR can be adjusted.
Consider the signal tap model for PCE2:
$Y_{i} = {\hat{\lambda}}_{i}S_{i} +
\underset{\text{Noise}'_{i}}{\overset{(\lambda_{i} - {\hat{\lambda}}_{i})S_{i}
+ N_{i}}{\underbrace{}}},\ i = 1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},N$,
where the noise term consists of both the noise (and interference) _N~i~_ ,
and the channel estimation error${\hat{\lambda}}_{i}$. Expectation of the
instantaneous SNR is calculated as:
with $\text{MSE}(\lambda_{i})$contributing to the SNR calculation. By
modifying the training symbol placement, and hence the MSE, the instantaneous
SNR over the burst can be adjusted towards a more balanced form. Please refer
to [6.2-3] for illustration of the SNR balancing effect.
To make the design feasible, the following constraints are used:
  * The training symbols are placed symmetrically over the part > consisting of payload and training symbols;
  * In the center of the burst, the training symbols are consecutively > placed to achieve a lower MSE in this part (the weak taps), thus > increase the SNR for this part;
  * In other parts of the burst, the training symbols are evenly placed.
A simplified implementation of training symbol placement, denoting as
$\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}}(\text{sp},\text{cn})$is calculated as follows. The
Matlab operators ":" and $\text{fliplr}$will be used.
$\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{left}_{\text{concentrated}}}}(\text{sp},\text{cn})
= \left\lbrack \frac{L}{2} - \frac{\text{cn}}{2} + 1:1:\frac{L}{2}
\right\rbrack$ ;
$\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{left}_{\text{uniform}}}}(\text{sp},\text{cn}) =
\left\lfloor \text{sp} + \frac{\frac{L}{2} - \frac{\text{cn}}{2} - \text{sp} +
2}{(\text{Ntr} - \text{cn}\frac{)}{2}}\left\lbrack 0:1:(\text{Ntr} -
\text{cn}\frac{)}{2} - 1: \right\rbrack \right\rfloor$;
$\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{left}}}(\text{sp},\text{cn}) = \left\lbrack
\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{left}_{\text{uniform}}}}\
\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{left}_{\text{concentrated}}}} \right\rbrack$;
$\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}}(\text{sp},\text{cn}) = \left\lbrack
\text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{left}}}\ \text{tsc}_{\text{ind}_{\text{right}}}
\right\rbrack$.
with $\text{sp}$denotes the index of the first training symbol, and
$\text{cn}$the number of training symbols concentrated in the middle of the
burst.
Figure 6.2-4 illustrates the concentrated training symbol placement according
to the above procedure.

##### 6.2.3.1.3 Evaluation of training symbol placement
In this section, performances with different training symbol placements based
on design criteria in 6.2.3.1 are evaluated. The design parameters are tuned
and a recommendation of the training symbol placement is made.

###### 6.2.3.1.3.2 Simulation Results and conclusions
The evaluation process involves:
  * Tuning the concentrated training symbol placement, including the > first training symbol, > {width="0.20833333333333334in" > height="0.18055555555555555in"}, and the number of concentrated > training symbols, > {width="0.20833333333333334in" > height="0.1527777777777778in"}in > {width="1.1388888888888888in" > height="0.2222222222222222in"}in both sensitivity and interference > limited scenarios (single interference and multiple > interferences);
  * Performance comparison with uniform placement and concentrated > placement, in both sensitivity and interference limited scenarios.
An example of performance comparison between uniform and concentrated TSC
placement can be seen in Figure 6.2-5.
{width="5.497222222222222in" height="4.269444444444445in"}
Figure 6.2-5. Performance of different training symbol placements in
sensitivity.
It can be seen that the concentrated placement generally outperforms the
uniform placement, which results from a balanced SNR. In TU channel, the gain
with concentrated placement can be over 1dB for SNR below 24 dB, and in static
channel, an overall improvement up to 2dB is achieved. It can also be noticed
that, in static channel, the gain increases as more training symbols are
concentrated, which is well aligned with the theoretical analysis of a more
balanced SNR.
Please refer to [6.2-3] for a detailed information about the evaluation and
simulation results.
The following conclusions are reached based on the evaluation:
Both the MMSE criterion and the balancing SNR criterion can be used to reach a
reasonable design of the training symbol placement;
  * The effectiveness of the balancing SNR criterion is limited by > non-AWGN noise, unknown and fading channel, and constraints made > for design simplicity;
  * For sensitivity, the concentrated placement outperforms the uniform > placement (especially at low SNR region). The gain is up to 1dB in > TU channel and up to 2dB in a Static channel.
  * In single interference case, concentrated placement is outperformed > by the uniform placement. The degradation is up to 1.5dB. The gap > steadily closes as > {width="0.20833333333333334in" > height="0.1527777777777778in"}increases;
  * In multi-interference case, the concentrated placements generally > outperform the uniform placement. At high C/I region, the uniform > placement outperforms concentrated placements with a lower > {width="0.20833333333333334in" > height="0.1527777777777778in"};
  * The placement of the first training symbol, > {width="0.20833333333333334in" > height="0.18055555555555555in"}, does not affect the performance > much in both sensitivity and interference limited scenario. The > differences are within 0.2dB for the simulated scenarios.
It is therefore recommend to use a concentrated training symbol placement,
with moderate amount of concentrated training symbols, to have non-negligible
gain in sensitivity and multi-interference scenario, while only a small
degradation in single interference case. For PCE2A, {width="1.0in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}is recommended; for PCE2B,
{width="0.9305555555555556in" height="0.2222222222222222in"}is recommended.

#### 6.2.3.2 TSC symbol position for Padded HOM
##### 6.2.3.2.1 Principle of TS symbol position generation
Since the padding symbols are already used to balance the SNR in Padded HOM, a
kind of uniform placement of TS symbols are investigated in this section. In
order to simplify the description, the burst format shown in this section is
given in the format before the Symbol swapping. As illustrated in [6.2-5],
symbols before the IDFT are swapped to ensure the performance of USF and
Header which are located in the middle of the burst. That means, in the burst
format shown here the symbols which are located in the middle of the burst are
mapped to the centre of the signal Bandwidth (BW) and the symbols at the both
ends of the burst are mapped to the edge of the signal BW.
The exemplary uniformly placed TS symbol position could be achieved as
follows:
  * Two TS symbols are assigned to each end of the burst;
  * Other TS symbols are evenly placed in the whole burst.
{width="5.379166666666666in" height="0.46875in"}
Figure 6.2-6 TS symbol position
For example, as shown in Figure 6.2-6, when the DFT size N=142, two TS symbols
are allocated at the symbol index 0 and 141. Other TS symbols are evenly
placed in the whole burst according to the TS length. A simple way to
implement this can be elaborated below.
The interval of every two TS symbols could be roughly calculated by:
  * TS_interval = round((N-2)/(NTS-1)), where N is the DFT size and NTS > is the TS length.
Hence, the training symbol indices TS_ind are usually calculated by:
  * TS_ind(1) = 0;
  * TS_ind(NTS)=N-1;
  * TS_ind(k) = TS_ind(k-1)+ TS_interval, for k=2,3,...,NTS-1.
A small adjustment is needed with some exception when TS symbol position index
exceeds the bound of the DFT size.
With respect to the TS length, it should also be taken into account for PCE2.
As we know, the TS symbols are mainly used to estimate the channel property.
The wireless channels change both in time and frequency. The frequency
coherence shows how quickly it changes in frequency. Coherence bandwidth is
the parameter which expresses the frequency coherence. It gives the range of
frequencies over which the channel can be considered \"flat\". Considering the
new characteristics of PCE2, the TS length in EGPRS2 may not be suitable for
PCE2. Within the coherence bandwidth, optimized TS length can give some extra
symbols for other use, such as more padding symbols at the edge of the signal
BW which can bring some performance improvement with little loss on channel
estimation.
Table 6.2-6 shows the resulting TS position index with different TS lengths
according to the principle described above.

In these evaluations, the TS symbols with shorter length are simply
intercepted from the legacy TS symbols. The detailed figures can be found in
[6.2-6].The absolute performance and the relative performance for PCE2-A and
PCE2-B with different TS lengths are given in Table 6.2-8 and Table 6.2-9 .The
gray cell means no simulation has been done in that scenario. The sign "∕"
means 10% BLER cannot be reached in that case. The positive value in Table
6.2-9 refers to the performance gain with the shorter TS length compared to
the legacy TS length while the negative value means the loss.
It can be seen that the performance of shorter TS length has little impact on
the performance in sensitivity and CCI scenario and has about 1 dB gain for
DAS-5, DAS-11 and DBS-5 and up to 3 dB gains for DBS-11 in ACI scenario.
### 6.2.4 Mapping of block fields
The optimal position of Data, Header, USF and SF fields in EGPRS2 and PC
EGPRS2 is not necessary identical.
This sub-clause evaluates different placements of the burst fields to i)
Ensure similar performance as EGPRS2 USF reception and ii) Ensure incremental
redundancy performance of Precoded EGPRS2.
#### 6.2.4.1 Header bit swap and burst shift of Single Block PCE2
##### 6.2.4.1.1 Introduction
In an EGPRS2 radio block there are different information fields that need to
be mapped on the information symbols of the bursts: Data, Header, USF, SF (and
optionally PAN). The mapping of these information fields are done in a
specific manner to guarantee both absolute and relative performance targets.
In Precoded EGPRS2 (PCE2) the characteristics of the burst is changed and thus
the mapping of these information fields need to be optimized.
This sub-clause presents results from an investigation performed in [6.2-7] on
the use of header bit swap and burst shift for PCE2 Header field to guarantee
robust incremental redundancy performance.
##### 6.2.4.1.2 PCE2 Burst characteristics
In EGPRS2 the training sequence code (TSC), is placed in the middle of the
burst. In general it can be assumed that the further away a data symbol is
from the TSC the weaker the performance gets. In PCE2 the TSC symbols need to
be spread out over the burst to optimize the channel estimation, see [6.2-3].
Further, the quality is no longer as dependent on the distance from the TSC
symbol but rather characterized by the spectral properties of the TX pulse.

Figure 6.2-10 Burst characteristics of a Precoded 16QAM EGPRS2 burst.
##### 6.2.4.1.3 Burst shift and Bit swapper
The MCS used, and the channel coding definitions needed to decode the data
block is signaled in the header. Thus, the header needs to be correctly
decoded for the data block to be correctly decoded. Further, if incremental
redundancy is used the operative range of the MCS will be wider but still the
condition of header decoding is valid.
To enhance header performance and secure a Header BLER performance relative to
the data BLER a burst shift can in combination with a bit swap be used on weak
header bits. The shift of the bits in the burst is done in a cyclic manner for
each half burst as shown in Figure 6.2-11.
{width="5.741666666666666in" height="1.426388888888889in"}
Figure 6.2-11 Burst mapping 16QAM, EGPRS2-A with (bottom) and without (top) a
circular shift of 20 bits.
The bit swapper will swap weak header bits to strong bit positions occupied by
data. This is illustrated in Figure 6.2-12.

Figure 6.2-12. Burst mapping 16QAM, EGPRS2-A with 20 bits circular shift and
with (bottom) and without (top) header bit swap.
In order to evaluate the relative performance needed between the Data and
Header BLER the relative performance of EGPRS2 Data and Header BLER has been
used as a reference. Since the channel coding definitions are kept intact for
PCE2 it is reasonable to assume that similar relative performance figures
should be kept.
##### 6.2.4.1.4 Simulation assumptions and Results
Table 6.2-10 summarizes the simulation assumptions used when deriving burst
shift and bit swap required to maintain the relative performance of EGPRS2
Header and Data BLER in PCE2.

##### 6.2.4.1.5 IR performance
In Figure 6.2-4 and -5 ideal link adaptation envelope curves are shown for
both PCE2-A, EGPRS2-A and PCE2-B, given shift and swap parameters according to
table 6.2-12. Visible impacts from the header is seen at Es/N0 \ in order to detect between a PCE2 and EGPRS2 user, for equipment > supporting both EGPRS2 and SBPCE2;
  * Circular shift of training sequence, which adds negligible > computations.
With the DFT size 144 (2*2*2*2*3*3) and 168 (2*2*2*3*7) [6.1-4] proposed for
PC EGPRS2A and PC EGPRS2B, the FFT calculation can be optimized, thus limiting
the increase of computational complexity due to the addition of FFTs.
To summarize, the computational complexity of blind detection in SBPCE2, given
method in 6.3.1.2, is roughly same as that for EGPRS2 (twice for equipment
supporting both E2 and SBPCE2) plus the computation of the FFT.
#### 6.3.1.4 Simulation Assumptions and Results
##### 6.3.1.4.1 Simulation Assumptions
Table 6.3-1 lists the common simulation assumptions in the evaluation.

The offsets used for each modulation type are listed in Table 6.3-2. The
cross-correlation property of the circular shifted training sequences is
verified and no degradation has been observed in CO-channel interference
scenario.

When using DAS-10b/11/12b v2 and DBS-10b/11b/12b v2, introduced in Section
6.1.1, the following modulation types and offsets are proposed.

DAS-10b/11b/12b and DBS-10b/11b/12b.

In Section 6.3.1.4.2, only results with modulation types according to table
6.3-2 are shown. However, given that the same numbers of offsets are proposed
for SBPCE2-B while one offset less is needed for SBPCE2-A, the presented
results are valid for both cases.
##### 6.3.1.4.2 Simulation Results
Figure 6.3-3 shows the SBPCE2-A and SBPPCE2-B performance of blind detection
based on the circular shifted training sequence, in interference limited and
noise limited scenario respectively. It can be seen that the modulation type
(QPSK/8PSK/16QAM/32QAM/64QAM), user type (EGPRS2/SBPCE2) and levels
(LevelA/LevelB for SBPCE2B) can be correctly detected. The performance
difference between ideal blind detection and blind detection based on circular
shift training sequence is small for the simulated scenarios, with the largest
degradation around 0.3dB for QPSK in sensitivity.

## 6.4 PAR reduction
By applying precoding to EGPRS2 the Peak-to-Average Ratio -- PAR -- of the
signal is increased.
This sub-clause contains methods and evaluations to reduce the PAR of PC
EGPRS2 while maintaining the spectral properties of the signal and minimizing
impact on link level performance.
### 6.4.1 PAR reduction for Single Block PCE2
Single Block Precoded EGPRS2 (SBPCE2) possesses an inherently large Peak to
Average power Ratio (PAR). This section presents an evaluation of PAR
reduction methods for SBPCE2, taking into consideration both the computational
complexity of the evaluated methods and their impact on performance.
Three alternative PAR reduction methods for SBPCE2 are briefly introduced in
the sub-clause 6.4.1.1. The chosen evaluation method and the results from the
PAR reduction exercise, along with complexity estimates of the methods are
described in sub-clause 6.4.1.2.
A detailed description on PAR reduction for SBPCE2 can be found in [6.4-1].
#### 6.4.1.1 PAR Reduction Methods
##### 6.4.1.1.1 Soft clipping
Soft clipping targets signal peaks exceeding a configured threshold. Each
targeted peak is compressed by a compensation signal as described in [6.4-2].
To maintain the spectrum of the soft clipped signal the compensation signal is
filtered through the Linearized GMSK pulse shaping filter.
##### 6.4.1.1.2 Hard clipping
Hard clipping limits the amplitude of all signal peaks exceeding a configured
threshold to the level of the threshold. This operation will widen the
spectrum of the signal, due to the sharp transitions around the clipped peaks.
The spectrum widening limits the PAR level that can be achieved while meeting
the spectrum requirements.
##### 6.4.1.1.3 Symbol rotation
In SBPCE2, a signal peak occurs when the sub-carriers transmitted at different
frequencies add constructively together. By rotating part of the signal with
angles selected from a pre-defined set, the signal PAR characteristics can be
altered. At the receiver side blind detection is performed over the rotated
training sequence, to detect the used rotation angle. Both the rotation angle
selection and blind detection are performed on a burst-by-burst basis.
In the results below the choice of rotation angle is used after upsampling and
pulse shaping. Alternative ways to choose rotation angle has been investigated
in [6.4-9] with minimal impact to performance (at most 0.2 dB) but a
significant reduction in complexity. The rotation angle is then chosen based
from a signal without oversampling and a 2 tap pulse shaping filter [1 1].
#### 6.4.1.2 PAR Reduction Evaluation
The PAR reduction methods are evaluated for all SBPCE2-A and SBPCE2-B MCSs
given a target PAR of 6dB. For DAS-5 -- DAS-7 and DBS-5 -- DBS-6 the PAR
reduction are also evaluated for a 4dB target.
Sub-clause 6.4.1.2.1 presents the simulation assumptions used through the
evaluations. To achieve maximal performance the PAR reduction methods
presented in sub-clause 6.4.1.1 were combined, as described in sub-clause
6.4.1.2.2 and 6.4.1.2.3. The sub-clauses also present the impact on
performance and spectral characteristics of the signal along with an
assessment of the computational complexity of the PAR reduction methods.
##### 6.4.1.2.1 Simulation Assumptions
The PAR reduction evaluations were performed with a PA model, verified towards
measurements on Spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise, to secure that
the signal spectrum characteristics were assessed correctly in the evaluation.
Figure 6.4-1 depicts the simulated spectrum of the basic SBPCE2 signal given
different impairment models.

##### 6.4.1.2.2 Soft Clipping combined with Symbol rotation
Soft clipping and Symbol rotation can be combined to compress the signal to a
desired PAR target. Table 6.4-1 lists the number of peaks clipped in order to
reach a target PAR, given this approach. The impact on both computational
complexity and performance from usage of symbol rotation are presented.
It can be concluded that soft clipping efficiently reduces the PAR. For the 6
dB target, 98% of the bursts reach their target after less than 11 clipped
peaks. The impact on performance is small for lower order MCSs, while 32QAM
and higher order modulated MCSs are less robust to clipping.
It is beneficial to use symbol rotation for the higher order modulated MCSs in
level B, while the performance degrades at lower MCSs due to erroneous blind
detection of the rotation angle.

##### 6.4.1.2.3 Soft Clipping combined with Hard clipping and Symbol rotation
To reduce the computational complexity Soft clipping and Symbol rotation can
be combined with Hard clipping. For a given PAR target, the soft clipping is
performed first and targets only the highest signal peaks. The hard clipping
is applied on the remaining peaks. The maximum number of hard clippings is
limited to secure that the spectrum are maintained within the 3GPP
requirements.
It can be seen in table 6.4-2 that by combining soft clipping with hard
clipping, the clipping efficiency is significantly enhanced, while performance
is maintained. Again it is beneficial to use symbol rotation for the higher
order modulated MCSs in level B, while the performance degrades at lower MCSs
due to erroneous blind detection of the rotation angle.
Table 6.4-2 Summary of PAR reduction results.

* Evaluated at 30% DataBLER.
For Low complexity SBPCE2 the performance degradation is at most an additional
0.5 dB compared to table 6.4-2. The additional degradation is mainly due to
the higher order modulation symbols that are needed to compensate for the
smaller FFT size used (compared to SBPCE2B). For more details, see [6.4-8]
As the signal is hard clipped the spectrum of the clipped signal will widen.
This is exemplified in the figures below for DAS-7 and DBS-6 given PAR targets
of 4dB and 6dB. In the figures it is seen that the spectrum widening is
dependent on the number of soft clipped peaks. As the number of soft clipped
peaks decrease, the impact from hard clipping on the spectrum characteristics

### 6.4.2 PAR Reduction for Padded HOM
Higher peak-to-average power ratio is introduced by the IDFT precoder in
PCE2.The clipping based PAR reduction method is performed for Padded HOM.This
section presents the techniques and investigates of the impact on the
performance and spectrum.
PAR reduction methods for Padded HOM are described in sub-clause 6.4.2.1.
Both the performance degradation and impact on the spectrum are evaluated and
described in sub-clause 6.4.2.2.
#### 6.4.2.1 PAR Reduction Method
The same soft and hard clipping algorithms described respectively in sub-
clause 6.4.1.1.1 and 6.4.1.1.2 are used for Padded HOM. The evaluations of the
clipping based PAR reduction method are given in the following sub-clauses.
#### 6.4.2.2 PAR Reduction Evaluation
In this sub-clause, the impact of PAR reduction with the combined soft and
hard clipping on the performance and spectrum are investigated. For a given
PAR target, the soft clipping is performed first and targets only the highest
peaks. The hard clipping is then applied on the remaining peaks. The number of
soft clipping peaks aligns with [6.4-7].

Table 6.4-4 shows the impact of PAR reduction on the link level performance.
For DAS-7, with a target PAR of 4 dB and 6 dB the spectrum requirements could
be met with a performance degradation of 1.5 dB (see Figure 6.4-6) and 0.2 dB
(see Figure 6.4-7), respectively. For DBS-6, with a target PAR of 4 dB and 6
dB the spectrum requirements could be met with a performance degradation of
1.5 dB (see Figure 6.4-10) and 0.1 dB (see Figure 6.4-11), respectively. In
other cases, with a target PAR of 6 dB, the spectrum requirements could be met
with a small performance degradation of less than 0.7 dB (except for DBS-11b
v2).
It can be seen in the figures that the target PAR could be efficiently reached
with several times of soft and hard clipping. The spectrum of the clipped
signal could be kept within the spectrum mask with acceptable performance
degradation.

### 6.4.3 PAR reduction complexity for Single Block PCE2
The evaluation in sub-clause 6.4.2 indicates that the combined soft and hard
clipping algorithm offers the best tradeoff between link level performance and
computational complexity. The ambition of this sub-clause is to verify this
indication, and make a thorough assessment of the computational complexity
demanded by the combined soft and hard clipping algorithm.
#### 6.4.3.1 Soft and Hard clipping algorithms
The soft clipping algorithm applies a compression signal to all signal peaks
exceeding a configured threshold. This compression signal _c~i~_ is typically
generated based on all signal samples _s~i~_ in a burst exceeding a configured
power threshold _th~pow~_ , or the corresponding amplitude threshold
_th~amp~_.
$c_{i} = \left{ \begin{matrix} s_{i} - \text{th}_{\text{amp}} \cdot
\frac{s_{i}}{\sqrt{s_{i}s_{i}^{}}}\ ,\ \text{if}\ s_{i}s_{i}^{} -
\text{th}_{\text{pow}} > 0 \ 0,\ \text{if}\ s_{i}s_{i}^{} -

###### 6.5.2.1.2.2 Measures to combat USF multiplexing
In [6.5-5] a modified burst format is shown for Precoded EGPRS2 where part of
the payload and the TSC is modulated in time domain to allow for multiplexing
with MSs not supporting Precoded EGPRS2. The potential gain with the modified
burst format is investigated in the simulations and indicated as 'Mod BF'.
USF granularity is a standardized solution for both EGPRS and EGPRS2, see
[6.5-6], where the network assigns (in e.g. PACKET UL ASSIGNMENT) the MS to
transmit either one (USF granularity = 1) or four (USF granularity = 4)
consecutive radio blocks in the UL at the reception of the assigned USF value.
In the following text the term USF granularity is used for the value set to 4.
Both USF granularity and the Modified burst format provide means improve UL
scheduling while minimizing restrictions on DL modulation transmissions. The
difference is that:
\- with USF granularity, restrictions apply on the DL modulation in that the
receiving MS shall be able to receive the modulated USF in the first block. In
the remaining three blocks no restrictions apply. It should be noted that if
the user has less than 4 blocks of data to send in the uplink when receiving a
USF with a granularity of 4 in the downlink, the resulting uplink blocks
carrying no user data are actually a waste of uplink resources, dependent on
the scenario and traffic model investigated.
\- with the modified burst format there is an expansion of the DL modulation
possible to use, in each block, see [6.5-5]. There is no impact on UL
granularity.
###### 6.5.2.1.2.3 Scheduling strategies
Two strategies are investigated:
  1. Strategy 1 does not take the USF problem into account. If a downlink block is sent using precoding or higher order modulation, containing a USF to a legacy MS, the legacy MS will not receive the USF and no transmission will occur in the corresponding uplink block. The USF granularity is 1 for all users.
  2. Strategy 2 is a simple attempt to reduce the USF problem. If there is a conflict between preferred downlink modulation and USF decoding, the MCS of the downlink block is reduced to accommodate USF reception. Strategy 2 has also been investigated in combination with using USF granularity 4 for EGPRS MSs and with the modified burst format ([6.5-5]) to further reduce multiplexing losses.
###### 6.5.2.1.2.4 Results
In figure 6.5-3 the throughput impact on downlink and uplink is shown at
different (PC)E2 MS penetrations using the simulation parameters and traffic
model in Table 6.5-3. Both scheduling strategies described in 6.5.2.1.3 have
been investigated using both USF granularity 1 and 4 for EGPRS capable MSs for
scheduling strategy 2. Note that USF granularity=1 is always used for (PC)E2
MSs. Also, the modified burst format ('Mod BF') has been used both with and
without USF granularity 4 of EGPRS MSs.
The large downlink gain seen is a combination of increased transmission
bitrate and decreased scheduling delays. The reason for the decreased
scheduling delays is the decrease in channel utilization (i.e. that less time
is needed to serve the offered traffic).
It can be seen that:
\- Scheduling strategy 1, i.e. prioritizing downlink throughput at the expense
of not being able to schedule uplink MSs, has a strong negative impact on
uplink throughput. This should not be seen as a realistic network
implementation but rather serve as the scenario where DL throughput is
prioritized.
\- Scheduling strategy 2, i.e. prioritizing uplink throughput by choosing an
MCS for downlink transmission (even if not optimum) that is compatible with
the receiver capability to ensure USF reception, has limited but visible
negative impact on downlink throughput if using USF granularity 1. All
investigated combinations of USF granularity and modified burst format, with
USF scheduling strategy 2, give the same, maximum UL throughput.
\- The reduced UL scheduling frequency by using USF granularity 4, see
6.5.2.1.3, for the EGPRS MSs does not seem to have visible impact to the
results but minimizes the throughput loss at USF granularity 1 considerably
for scheduling strategy 2, almost completely matching scheduling strategy 1.
\- For both USF granularity 1 and 4, using the modified burst format does show
some additional gains.
\- It can be seen that using USF granularity 4 and the modified burst format,
in some cases, slightly improves downlink performance compared to scheduling
strategy 1 (with USF granularity 1). This gain is believed to be related to
the more efficient use of UL resources for scheduling strategy 2.
Further, it should be noted that additional measures to limit the throughput
loss such as outlined in [6.5-4] have not been implemented in the simulator.
For more results on other MS penetration scenarios and other network loads
please see [6.5-4].

##### 6.5.2.1.3 PAN multiplexing
The piggy backed Ack/Nack introduced in Rel-7 with the LATRED feature is
signaled in the header by the PANI field. The PAN block is accommodated by
extra puncturing of the data block and is then interleaved together with the
data and bit swapped to ensure good enough performance to allow for PAN
scheduling in DL to users not intended for payload reception (similar to the
flexibility of USF).
In a SBPCE2 block there is no possibility of the legacy, non Precoded, MS to
receive the PAN field which is spread across all four burst of the radio block
at positions usually occupied for data.
In similarity to the USF, if a scheduling opportunity for the PAN is lost the
Ack/Nack cannot be sent in the block, resulting in larger transfer delay. A
number of measures can be taken to alleviate this problem. The mechanisms
described for the USF, e.g. lowering of MCS to accommodate PAN reception can
be used and/or minimize multiplexing of different MS capabilities in the
channel allocation to further minimize impacts of multiplexing. It should also
be noted that the higher the multiplexing rate the lower the probability of
delay sensitive services being allocated on the channels. Also, low latency
applications typically has a relatively low target BLER (low frequency) used
for (using PAN functionality) and PAN is typically transmitted per TBF and not
on a timeslot resolution as for the USF.

## 6.6 Impacts on base station and mobile station
This sub clause evaluates the impact of Precoded EGPRS2 to base station and
mobile station implementations.
Considerations of re-usable functionality from LTE, such as FFT size,
modulation definitions and demodulation, can be considered in the evaluation.
### 6.6.1 Impacts on base station
#### 6.6.1.1 Single Block Precoded EGPRS2, SBPCE2
The introduction of PCE2 affects the transmitter chain in the BTS. Table 6.6-1
lists the blocks that are new or need to be modified. The complexity estimates
are based on the assumption that SBPCE2 is the technique used in the
transmitter chain. Since some of the signal processing algorithms are
dependent upon the sampling rate, which is implementation dependent, the
complexity estimates are given as a function of the oversampling rate _os_ (an
integer).
The most computationally demanding block in the modulator is pulse shaping.
Its complexity is dependent on the oversampling rate. Thus, it is reasonable
to quantify the increase in complexity due to precoding as a percentage of the
computational cost of pulse shaping. The overall complexity increase due to
precoding is between 43% and 95% for level A, and between 39% and 130% for
level B, depending on the oversampling rate. The lowest percentage corresponds
to an oversampling rate of 48, while the highest corresponds to an
oversampling rate of 4. These estimates include the Inverse Fourier Transform,
ramping, soft and hard clipping, and in the case of level B, PAPR reduction by
means of training sequence rotation.
For the complexity estimation of SBPCE2-B, Low Complexity SBPCE2-B, LCSBPCE2-B
is used.
The addition of clipping is the main contributor to the increase in
complexity, followed by the IFFT.

#### 6.6.1.2 Padded Higher Order Modulation, Padded HOM
Table 6.6-1a shows the blocks and computational complexity estimation affected
by the introduction of Padded HOM in the BTS transmitter chain. The
oversampling rate os (an integer) is used as a parameter when the operations
are given.
For the complexity estimation Low complexity Padded HOM is used, where 144 and
162 FFT length are utilized for level-A and level-B estimation.
The increase in complexity due to precoding is quantified as a percentage of
the computational cost of pulse shaping. The overall complexity increase due
to precoding is between 43% and 95% for level A, and between 35% and 75% for
level B, depending on the oversampling rate. The lowest percentage corresponds
to an oversampling rate of 48, while the highest corresponds to an
oversampling rate of 4. These estimates include the Inverse Fourier Transform,

### 6.6.2 Impacts on mobile station
#### 6.6.2.1 Single Block Precoded EGPRS2, SBPCE2
The introduction of PCE2 affects the receiver chain in the MS. Table 6.6-2
lists the blocks that are new or need to be modified. The complexity estimates
are based on the assumption that SBPCE2 is the technique used in the receiver
chain. Since some of the signal processing algorithms are dependent upon the
length of the synchronization window, which is implementation dependent, the
complexity estimates are given as a function of the synchronization function
length _win_len_ (an integer).
For the complexity estimation of SBPCE2-B, LCSBPCE2-B is used.
Blind detection is the main contributor to the increase in complexity. The
demodulation, however is significantly less costly than for EGPRS2.
The complexity of an EGPRS2 receiver can be roughly estimated as follows. It
is assumed that a trellis search using a reduced trellis is performed.
Moreover, it is assumed that only two survivors are kept at every trellis
stage, and that only 2 MLSE taps are used. In other words, a low complexity
trellis search is assumed for the EGPRS2 demodulator. The total number of
arithmetic operations has been counted, assuming that multiplications,
additions and maximum calculations have all the same cost. The total cost is
estimated to be 1919 operations per trellis step. For level A this gives a
total of 223000 = 1919*116 operations and for level B 265000 = 1919*138
operations. From statistics from actual receivers, it has been estimated that
the estimation block, comprising blind detection, synchronization and channel
estimation in an EGPRS2 receiver, consumes 30% of the number operations used
in the trellis search. Moreover, from receiver statistics it is estimated that
blind detection accounts for 20% of the complexity of the estimation block.
Based on these estimates, it is possible to calculate the number of operations
consumed by the EGPRS2 equalizer and the number of operations consumed by
blind detection. The equalization of one 32QAM modulated EGPRS2A burst
consumes about 290000 operations, while the equalization of one 32QAM
modulated EGPRS2B burst consumes approximately 345000 operations. In addition,
blind detection for level A is estimated to consume 13380 operations, while
blind detection for level B is estimated to consume 15900 operations. Using
these estimates, assuming a synchronization window with length _win_len_ = 5
symbols, and using Table 6.6-2 below, it is possible to compare the complexity
of PCE2 to EGPRS2. The equalization of one PCE2A burst, for an MS supporting
EGPRS, EGPRS2A, PCE2A consumes 103000 operations. The equalization of one
PCE2B burst, for an MS supporting EGPRS, EGPRS2A, EGPRS2B, PCE2A, PCE2B,
consumes 144000 operations.
Taking into account channel decoding, the total complexity of the equalization
and decoding of one 64QAM modulated PCE2A radio block is about 76% as complex
as the equalization and decoding of one 32QAM modulated EGPRS2A radio block.
Similarly, the equalization and decoding of one 64QAM modulated PCE2B radio
block is estimated to be around 82% as complex as the equalization and
decoding of one EGPRS2B radio block.

#### 6.6.2.2 Padded Higher Order Modulation, Padded HOM
Table 6.6-2a shows the blocks and computational complexity estimation affected
by the introduction of Padded HOM in the MS receiver chain. The
synchronization window length _win_len_ = 5 symbols is used when the
operations are given.
For the complexity estimation Low complexity Padded HOM is used, where 144 and
162 FFT length are utilized for level-A and level-B estimation.
The operations of legacy 32QAM modulated EGPRS receiver is in reference to the
analysis in section 6.6.2.1 Taking into account channel decoding, the total
complexity of the equalization and decoding of one 64QAM modulated Padded
HOM-A radio block is about 51% as complex as the equalization and decoding of
one 32QAM modulated EGPRS2A radio block. Similarly, the equalization and
decoding of one 64QAM modulated Padded HOM-B radio block is estimated to be
around 53% as complex as the equalization and decoding of one EGPRS2B radio
block.

##### 7.1.1.3 Padded HOM specific assumptions
It should be noted that to facilitate the evaluation some of the design
parameters for Padded HOM has not been strictly followed. These
simplifications are not expected to have any impact on the results, or the
conclusions drawn. Simulation assumptions used and modifications done are
presented in this section.

* * *
Parameter Value MCS DAS-5-12 CP length 6 TSC placement According to [7.1.5]
* * *
It should be noted that the CP length is not chosen according to [7.1.5] but
considering the evaluation done in [7.1.6] where a CP of 5 symbols was seen
sufficient for the propagation channel used in this paper. Thus, choosing a
longer CP length will not have impact on performance.
The TSC placement has been used as defined in [7.1.5] since this is a design
parameter believed to have impact on the results considering the different
numbers and allocation of the sub carriers between SBPCE2 and Padded HOM.
In the Padded HOM proposal the burst format is not symmetric nor is the number
of bits per radio block equal to the bits carried by the HOM symbols. In this
evaluation both burst symmetry and burst sizes that fit the block size have
been chosen. The changes to the design are minimal and should not have impact
on performance. Table 7.1.4 summarizes the differences.
Additional features such as Repeat pattern ([7.1.5]) or a shorter TSC
([7.1.5]) have also been investigated for Padded HOM previous investigations.
Repeat pattern together with shorter TSC was only investigated in sensitivity
with 0.3 and 0.9 dB gains seen (in [7.1.5]) for DAS-5 and DAS-11 respectively.
For DAS-12 2.2 dB gains were observed.

Adj (lower left).
It should be noted that the header performance of both techniques were aligned
within 1.5 dB, see [7.1.1]. Considering the findings in **Error! Reference
source not found.** where a header BLER improvement of 15 dB caused a data
BLER degradation of at most 1 dB these differences are expected to have
minimal impact on the data BLER performance comparison in this investigation.
For more details on the performance evaluation please see [7.1.7].
### 7.1.3 Discussion
It has been seen that SBPCE2 outperforms Padded HOM in both sensitivity and
co-channel interference with the most significant differences for co-channel
interference where gains of 2-5 dB can be seen for performance with reduced
PAR. For adj-channel interference Padded HOM is superior for most MCSs due to
the narrower spectrum used for payload allocation. For the highest MCSs
however there is still a significant degradation compared to SBPCE2.
In all scenarios investigated DAS-12 with reduced PAR for Padded HOM did not
reach BLER levels lower than 50% which makes the MCSs not useful for link
adaptation. Significant degradations when reducing the PAR are seen due to the
high modulation order used and the high code rate of this MCSs.

Figure 7.2.2 SBPCE2 and Padded HOM, level-B, Sensitivity (top left), Co (top
right), Adj (lower left).
It can be seen that Padded HOM outperforms SBPCE2 in all scenarios
investigated at level-B. SBPCE2 has slightly gains in the middle range of
EsN0/CIR in sensitivity and CCI scenarios at level-A. In ACI scenario Padded
HOM is superior for all modulation types.
### 7.2.2 Comparison of redesigned coding schemes
#### 7.2.1.1 Simulation assumptions
The new channel coding DAS/DBS-12b proposed for SBPCE2 in [7.2.1] [7.2.6] and
DAS/DBS-12b proposed for Padded HOM in [7.2.4] are evaluated with the same
receiver. The specific and common simulation assumptions are listed in
table7.2.2. The burst formats and coding parameters of the new channel coding
are depicted in table 7.2.3 and table7.2.4.
The IDFT length of DAS-12b for SBPCE2 is not strictly followed. This change of
the design is minimal and should not have impact on performance. The MMM is
not considered in this evaluation.

The evaluation results are tabulated from table7.2.5 to table 7.2.7. It is
noted that in all scenarios investigated the data performance of DAS-12b and
DBS-12b for Padded HOM outperforms DAS-12b and DBS-12b for SBPCE2. The gain is
as much as 1.2 dB to 5.3 dB. The header performance of DAS-12b and DBS-12b for
Padded HOM is also better than DAS-12b and DBS-12b for SBPCE2 in most
scenarios except for several degradations less than 0.5dB.
### 7.2.3 Discussion
The PAR reduction is not considered in this study for the time being. Based on
the observations in the [7.1.1], the impact of the PAR reduction between the
two candidate techniques is less than 0.6dB (except DAS/DBS-11) by comparing
the no-clipping with the clipping values in all scenarios investigated.
Therefore the impact of PAR reduction on the performace of these two
candidates is very limited in low MCSs.

# 8 Comparison of PC EGPRS2 with EGPRS2 performance
The performance objective of the SPEED study item, presented in sub-clause
4.2, is to significantly improve data throughput performance when introducing
PC EGPRS2 as compared to realistic EGPRS2 performance.
To determine if the performance objective has been fulfilled the following
sub-clauses present realistic PC EGPRS2 and EGPRS2 throughput performance. To
enable a fair comparison between the candidate PC EGPRS2 techniques and EGPRS2
each performance evaluation shall present a set of simulation parameters,
common to all evaluations.
Common assumptions to all evaluations further assume:
  * PC EGPRS2 specific:
  * Inclusion of blind modulation detection.
  * EGPRS2 specific:
  * PAR, see [8.10]:
  * NSR, 8PSK: 3.2 dB
  * NSR, 16QAM: 4.7 dB
  * NSR, 32QAM: 5.1 dB
  * HSR, QPSK 3.4 dB
  * HSR, 16QAM 5.3 dB
  * HSR, 32QAM 5.7 dB
  * EGPRS2 and PC EGPRS2:
  * C/I and Es/N0 is defined by the measured power of the carrier and > the interferer/thermal noise , measured over the useful part of > the burst (including payload symbols and training sequence > symbols), see Section 4 in [8.11], with the exception for DTS-2 > where the C/I is defined to the strongest Co-channel interferer > (C/I1), see Annex L in [8.11] .
  * If the backoff used is assumed to be equal to or greater than the > PAR of the signal the PA model can be omitted from the set of Tx > impairments used, if this is not believed to impact performance. > PAR is in this context referring to a deterministic maximum of the > signal, i.e. for PC EGPRS2 hard clipping or similar functionality > is needed to ensure the limited signal dynamics.
  * Realistic Tx and Rx impairments.
  * Backoff included in sensitivity limited evaluations.
  * Header performance included in the evaluation and header design for > PC EGPRS2 evaluated in 6.2.4 by incremental redundancy or other > means.
  * Inclusions of AFC functionality for EGPRS2. For PC EGPRS2 the use of > AFC is TBD.
The interference modulation shall be according to the interferer modulation
definitions specified in TS45.005 for EGPRS2.

## 9.2 Conclusions
During the SPEED feasibility study two candidate techniques, Single Block
Precoded EGPRS2 -- SBPCE2, and Padded Higher Order Modulation -- Padded HOM,
have been proposed and evaluated against the objectives of the study to
significantly improve throughput compared to realistic EGPRS2 performance,
while keeping negative impact to the spectral properties, cell reselection,
USF/PAN multiplexing to a minimum, and avoiding hardware impact to both base
station and mobile station.
Both techniques share several commonalities and the design is almost identical
for the three highest MCSs in each EGPRS2 set, which are generally used to the
largest extent in the LA curves. For lower MCSs, Padded HOM uses less sub
carriers, with positive impact on ACI, while the SBPCE2 design keeps the
number of sub carrier the same for all MCSs. The performance difference in
absolute performance between the two candidate techniques seen in the TR, see
[9.1-2], and [9.1-3], is expected to be related to the receiver design rather
than to the difference in the design of the physical layer. As seen in the
performance set provided in [9.1-2], small differences are seen between the
candidate techniques given an evaluation by the same company.
Given the reasoning above it is expected that Padded HOM fulfils the
objectives of the study. The candidate technique that has shown compliance to
all objectives is Single Block Precoded EGPRS2.
The throughput gains of the techniques have been evaluated by ideal link
adaptation throughput curves on link level in all currently specified
scenarios in [9.1-4].
SBPCE2 has shown to give average throughput gains, based on calculations using
C/I distributions from network simulations, with realistic performance (i.e.
with PAR reduction for SBPCE2, typical Tx/Rx impairments modeled, and impact
to Blind detection of modulation taken into account) of:
It should be noted that when functional blocks of the receiver are not aligned
or a complexity estimate of the receivers is not available it is not clear if
the observed performance differences seen below for Level A and Level B are
due to different receiver optimization or the different modulation techniques.
[Level A]{.underline}
When functional blocks of the receiver has been aligned/not been aligned
between EGPRS2 and SBPCE2:
* * *
Sensitivity: +16-54% / +3-18% CCI: +28-37% / +9-15% DTS-2: +41-44% / +8-12%
ACI*: +27-44% / +2-9% * Functional receiver blocks not aligned.
* * *
At RA 250 km/h SBPCE2 is usually inferior or on par with EGPRS2 performance.
[Level B]{.underline}
When functional blocks of the receiver have not been aligned between EGPRS2
and SBPCE2:
* * *
Sensitivity: +7-+20% CCI: -3 - +11% DTS-2: -6 -- +20% ACI: -6 - +14%
* * *
At RA 250 km/h SBPCE2 is usually inferior or on par with EGPRS2 performance. A
significant degradation is seen for ACI case with a degradation of at most
30%.
[TIGHTER]{.underline}
Compared to TIGHTER performance, see [9.1-4], SBPCE2 show link level gains
[dB] of:
* * *
Level A:  
\- CCI 3-10 dB \- ACI 6-23 dB Level B:  
\- CCI 1.5-8 dB
* * *
NOTE: Low Complexity SBPCE2-B, LC SBPCE2-B, has been used in the evaluation of
SBPCE2 for level B.

###### ### Annex A: Throughput comparison
The throughput comparison presented in this Annex is based on the performance
of Section 8 in the TR. The performance has been used in the conclusion of the
study in Section 9 to state compliance to the performance objective. A SINR
probability distribution derived from a 3/9 frequency reuse network simulation
has been used to get an estimation of the gain in CCI, Sensitivity and the
DTS-2 scneario. For ACI a shift of 6 dB for the distribution has been applied.
In A.2 an example of the methodology used is shown.
In A.3 the tabulated results are presented.

# A.2 Average throughput gain calculation
The calculation of average throughput gain used in A.3 is shown below from
Table 8.2-2, TU3iFH between SBPCE2-A(Ericsson) and EGPRS2(ST-Ericsson SA).
A weighted average of the gain based on Table A.1 is calculated as input to
the tables in A.3:
32*0.04 + 54*0.18 + 49*0.29 + 42*0.23 + 17*0.13 + 3*0.07 + 1*0.06 = 37.35 % ≈
