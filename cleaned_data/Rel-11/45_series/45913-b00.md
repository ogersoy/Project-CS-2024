# Introduction
The EGPRS2-B feature has been included into GERAN Rel-7 with the legacy GMSK
pulse shape. This pulse shape yields good performance and can be used without
any requirements on the operator network scenario.
Initial analysis have shown that in certain network scenarios, a spectrally
wider pulse shape can improve data throughput performance further.
To obtain superior data throughput performance, investigation of a wider pulse
shape is needed, including the network scenarios that will benefit from a
wider pulse shape. Selection of either the legacy pulse shape or the new pulse
shape will be under operator control.
It is not clear to what degree the current spectral mask can be widened
without causing a detrimental impact on legacy mobile stations in these
networks. It is also not clear if a spectral mask relaxation is dependent on
the modulation transmitted or whether it can be assumed to be applicable for
all modulations. It is important to continue to improve the GERAN system
performance with new features, and as such it is relevant that this topic is
carefully and independently studied.

# 4 Objectives
## 4.1 Performance objectives
### 4.1.1 Data throughput improvements
The objective is to further enhance the data throughput of EGPRS2-B on the
downlink.
## 4.2 Compatibility objectives
### 4.2.1 Maintenance of voice quality
The introduction of the wide bandwidth pulse should not decrease voice quality
as perceived by the user.
The criteria for minimum call quality shall be:
1st Criterion: blocked calls \ N (dBm) = 10log(kTB*1000) + NF where k=1.3804e-23 J/K, T=298K, B=325000 or
> 270833 Hz, NF = 10
>
> N (dBm) = -119.5 + NF for normal symbol rate
>
> N (dBm) = -118.7 + NF for higher symbol rate
In the simulator, this noise component was implemented level relative to the
dominant co-channel narrow interferer.
#### 8.2.5.6 First Stage Mapping (CIR to BER)
This section gives the CIR to BER mappings for the reference LGMSK pulse,
candidate pulse #2 and candidate pulse #3.

#### 8.2.5.7 Second Stage Mapping (BER to BLER)
In this section, the second stage mappings are given, i.e. the expected BLER
as a function of the mean (µ) and the variance (σ) of the uncoded BER for each
burst of the RLC data block or speech frame that was predicted by the 1st
stage mapping.
In the case of DBS-11 and DBS-12, the RLC data block is interleaved over a
single burst, hence the variance in these cases is zero.

#### 8.2.5.8 Second Stage Mapping for Non-hopping Channel
The inter-burst correlation that exists in a non-hopping channel for a slowly
moving user can be seen in the BER to BLER mapping in the low variance part of
the surface. This is because the SNIR is correlated between consecutive bursts
resulting in a reduced variance of the BER within a radio block.
For example, the figure below shows the surface taken from a non-hopping
simulation for DBS-5 (DTS-2 profile).
{width="5.240972222222222in" height="3.9375in"}
When the surface from a hopping simulation is examined, a corresponding low
variance part can also be seen. For example, the figure below shows the
surface taken from a hopping simulation for DBS-5 (DTS-2 profile).
{width="5.267361111111111in" height="3.9375in"}
This section investigates whether the surface obtained by a hopping simulation
can be used in non-hopping simulations.
First, the hopping surface is validated against data generated from a hopping
simulation for DBS-5 to DBS-12. In all figures, TU3 channel and DTS-2
interference and wide Tx pulse has been assumed with the exception of 32QAM
for hopping data, where the LGMSK Tx pulse has been used.
{width="5.768055555555556in" height="2.626388888888889in"}
{width="5.768055555555556in" height="2.8368055555555554in"}
The hopping surface is next validated against data generated from a non-
hopping simulation for DBS-5 to DBS-12.
{width="5.768055555555556in" height="2.865972222222222in"}
{width="5.768055555555556in" height="2.920138888888889in"}
{width="5.768055555555556in" height="2.754861111111111in"}
The above figures show the error is negligible in both cases. It can therefore
be concluded that the BER to BLER mapping derived for the hopping channel is
also valid also for a non-hopping channel.
# 9 System level studies
## 9.1 Introduction
System level studies will be performed for each network configuration, to
determine the impact of the candidate pulse shapes to legacy services and to
determine the throughput gain of the wide pulse shape compared to the
reference i.e. EGPRS2-B using the narrowband pulse shape.
## 9.2 System Performance Evaluation
### 9.2.1 Evaluation method
The evaluation method is ffs.
### 9.2.2 System performance results
This clause contains the System performance results from Nokia & Nokia Siemens
Networks.
#### 9.2.2.1 Evaluation method
The load for the CS resources was set to give 2 % blocking. This blocking
criterion was kept across all scenarios and pulse shapes, yielding more or
less constant load in the CS resources.
In the PS resources, the load was determined by the call arrival rate, which
was determined by the number of data users in the network (one call per user
was assumed).
For the reference pulse simulation, the PS load was set to maximum, which is
when the rate of newly arrived calls equalled the rate of ending calls (in
this context a call is a temporary block flow).
For the wide pulse simulations, the PS load was first equal the PS load in the
reference pulse simulation. This is to provide an evaluation of the existing
users in the network. The PS load was then be increased to maximum to
determine if more data users can be supported with the wide pulse without
impacting legacy users (i.e. there is a 'data capacity' gain with the wide
pulse). Note that this last step was not performed.
The PS load can be defined as the average number of active TBFs per timeslot.
This is shown in Figure 9.1 and Figure 9.3 for each simulation. Figure 9.2 and
Figure 9.4 depict the timeslot utilisation in each simulation.

#### 9.2.2.2 Impact on speech quality
The impact of each pulse shape to legacy speech users is given in Figure 9.5
and Figure 9.6 -- reference pulse (NB) vs candidate pulse #2 (WB#2) vs
candidate pulse #3 (WB#3).
The criteria for a BQC is average FER > 1 % except in network scenario WIDER-1
where it is > 2 %.
The target percentage of BQCs is \ Table 10.2: Median throughput and capacity gains (network load = saturated)
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | Network | Candidate | Candidate | | | | load = | #2 | #3 | | | | saturated | | | | | | | | | | | | Network | | | | | | co | | | | | | nfiguration | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | | Median | Data | Median | Data | | | throughput | capacity | throughput | capacity | | | gain | gain | gain | gain | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | WIDER-1 | 27 % | 24 % | 23 % | 22 % | | (BCCH | | | | | | layer) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | WIDER-1 | 16 % | 20 % | 13 % | 19 % | | (TCH layer) | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | WIDER-2 | 20 % | 18 % | 19 % | 16 % | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | WIDER-3 | 25 % | 20 % | 19 % | 20 % | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
In the figures in Table 10.2, data capacity is defined by the call arrival
rate that can be supported before the network becomes saturated (i.e. when the
call arrival rate equaled the call ending rate) and data capacity gain is the
percentage difference in data capacity between the wide bandwidth pulse and
the LGMSK pulse. Throughput gain is the percentage difference in the median
throughput of the data calls between the wide bandwidth pulse and the LGMSK
pulse measured before the network becomes saturated (i.e. when the call
arrival rate equaled the call ending rate). The findings demonstrate that a
throughput gain of 13 -- 27 % and a data capacity gain of 16 -- 24 %
(depending on the network scenario and pulse shape) can be achieved when a
wide bandwidth pulse shape is utilized. This is a result of the improved
receiver performance as a result of the lower inter-symbol interference.
The study also evaluated the impact of the lower adjacent-channel protection
on the speech quality of legacy users. The findings can be found in clause
9.2.2.2 and are summarized in Table 10.3 and Table 10.4.
Table 10.3: Change in Bad Quality Calls for legacy users (network load =
reference load)

The findings demonstrate that the lower adjacent-channel protection did not
degrade the speech performance of a legacy mobile, or resulted in a
degradation considered acceptable, even though the network saturation level
was reached. This is because there were fewer PS timeslots than CS timeslots
in the evaluated scenarios. The speech performance in Table 10.3 had the added
benefit of lower timeslot occupancy of the wide pulse shape as a result of the
throughput gain.
# 11 Conclusion
Based on the findings of the WIDER study item which have been collated in this
Technical Report, it is concluded that for the evaluated scenarios, a
throughput gain of 13 -- 27 % and a data capacity gain of 16 -- 24 %
(depending on the network scenario and pulse shape) can be achieved for
EGPRS2-B users when a wide bandwidth pulse shape is utilized without degrading
the speech performance of a legacy mobile, or resulted in a degradation
considered acceptable, even though the network saturation level was reached.
While the evaluated scenarios were believed to represent the most relevant for
the EGPRS2-B service, they should not be considered as representing all
network scenarios. Hence it is recommended that the mandatory Tx pulse shall
be the linearised GMSK pulse and the use of the wide bandwidth pulse shall be
optional to an operator.
Further investigations into the performance of a wide bandwidth pulse shape
and its impact to legacy users may be taken into account into future versions
of this Technical Report.
