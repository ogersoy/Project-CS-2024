# Introduction
The Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) Alliance is a mobile
telecommunications association of mobile operators, vendors, manufacturers and
research institutes. It was founded by major mobile operators in 2006 as an
open forum to evaluate candidate technologies to develop a common view of
solutions for the next evolution of wireless networks. The NGMN Alliance
complements and supports standards organizations by providing a coherent view
of what mobile operators require.
The NGMN project Operational Efficiency (OPE) has taken the task to elaborate
solutions and recommendations for pushing the operational efficiency in NMGN
networks and has produced recommendations on standards and implementations.
The NGMN OPE project strongly influenced the Top OPE Recommendations [2] in
the operational area.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides a gap analysis between NGMN Top OPE
Recommendations [2] and OAM capabilities offered by 3GPP SA5 Integration
Reference Points (IRPs).
Based on this gap analysis, it provides a compliance statement of SA5
specifications against NGMN Top OPE Recommendations. For each Top OPE
Recommendation, the SA5 solution is described when it exists. Otherwise, some
action may be considered to address the Top OPE recommendation.
Based on that information, a compliance statement is produced which can take
the following values:
\- Supported,
\- Partially Supported,
\- Not Supported,
\- Not Applicable.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

## 7.1 OAM Support for SON
**Abstract of Top OPE Recommendations Clause 4.1: OAM Support for SON:\ \**
\"SON and related benefits are seen as an essential economical characteristic
of LTE strongly asked for by all operators. As a consequence it has to be
ensured that operator keep the control on all new SON functionality by
implementation of appropriate policy control functions.\ An effective OAM
support provides operator with network control in SON trust building and
learning phase. It allows in all situations that a very good network quality
can be assured.\"

\"Optimization for identified parameters can be done within a value range,
defined by the operator.\  
Note: operator and supplier providing a SON solution have to consider that the
configuration of a value range eventually could restrict SON functionality
leading to less benefits of such a solution. On the other hand without such a
definition of a value range SON functionality could lead to negative impacts.
It is in interest of supplier and operator to find for every use case the
appropriate compromise in form of a well balanced implementation to meet the
targets of a specific SON functionality and to avoid side effects. For field
solutions the best fitting value range has to be found and to be set as vendor

## 7.4 Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT)
**Abstract of Top OPE Recommendations Clause 4.4: Minimization of Drive
Tests:\ \** \"Network operators strongly rely on manual drive-tests to collect
the field measurements that are needed to monitor and optimize the performance
of their networks. Drive-tests require a huge effort in terms of resources and
time. Moreover, drive test can be usually only be done in specific areas (e.g.
roads), whereas users and traffic are also distributed on areas not accessible
for drive-tests (e.g. indoor). Therefore, it will be highly beneficial to
automate the collection of field measurements and to minimize the need for
operators to rely on manual drive-tests.
Drive-tests require a huge effort in terms of resources and time so huge
potential is given if typical information can be provided by other methods
than by today's cost driving drive tests.\"

## 7.6 Load Balancing (LB)
**Abstract of Top OPE Recommendations Clause 4.6: Load Balancing\ \** \"Load
balancing promises the usage of given redundancy in the network to move load
from the capacity restricted resource to these ones which have free capacity
by sharing load information and appropriate reaction on this.
Using the given redundancy in overlapping cell areas peak load situation can
be handled by load balancing functionality delivering a better customer
experience and higher revenue of deployed resources. Secondly necessary
capacity based on identified overload can be timely shifted or even avoided.\"

## 7.7 Cell Outage Compensation (COC)
**Abstract of Top OPE Recommendations Clause 4.7: Cell Outage Compensation:\
\** \"It has to be separated between detection and mitigation.
Cell Outage Detection: Cell outage is detected by statistical analysis, alarm
or customer complains. Often, it may not be detected for several hours /days
(sleeping cell). This may also only refer to some service in a cell (e.g.
sleeping HSDPA, sleeping GPRS). The Goal is that automatic system
functionality detects sleeping or poor performing cells.
Cell Outage Compensation: The network is being reconfigured to compensate the
loss of service in the respective area. It is ensured that in surrounding area
of cell in outage the cells which are not directly involved in COC activities
significant quality indicators like call drop rate and average throughputs are
not negatively affected. When the failure has been removed an autonomous
reconfiguration shall take place. The Goal is:
HW failure of eNodeB unit causes complete outage of a cell. Loss shall be
compensated by the network as much as possible until the failure is removed
using redundancy in the network.
Revenue loss of cells or services is avoided. Further customer impact is
minimized in case of losses. Maintenance activities can / maybe shifted to
planned maintenance time periods with following cost savings.\"

\"The network element can, at the lowest layer, consolidate all available
