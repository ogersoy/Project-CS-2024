# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**32.381: Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements.**
**32.382: Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Information Service (IS).**
32.386: Partial Suspension of Itf-N Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Solution Set (SS) definitions.
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of IRPs and a related Name
Convention, which realise the functional capabilities over this interface. The
basic structure of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS
32.102 [2].
Information of an event is carried in a notification. An IRPAgent (typically
an EM or a NE) emits notifications (see 3GPP TS 32.302 [3]. The IRPManager
(typically a Network Management System) receives notifications. In certain
scenarios floods of unwanted notifications including alarms would be sent to
the IRP manager by network object instances. Thereby the interface and the
management systems bear unnecessary load. Even worse: the Operator\'s
awareness is drawn away from really urgent events.
# 1 Scope
The purpose of Partial Suspension of Itf-N IRP is to define an interface
through which an IRPManager can suspend the forwarding of notifications via
Itf-N which were generated in parts of the managed systems.
The present document is the Information Service of Partial Suspension of Itf-N
IRP. It defines, for the purpose of suspending generally the forwarding of
notifications, the information observable and controlled by management
system\'s client and it also specifies the semantics of the interactions used
to carry this information.

### 5.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This clause depicts the set of IOCs that encapsulate information within the
partial suspension of Itf-N IRP. The intent is to identify the information
required for the partial suspension of Itf-N IRP implementation of its
operations and notification emission. This clause provides the overview of all
Information Object Classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed
specification of various aspects of these information object classes.

Figure 6.1-1: Class Diagram for AlarmIRPOperation_6 Interface
## 6.2 Generic rules
**Rule 1:** Each operation with at least one input parameter supports a pre-
condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 2:** Each operation with at least one optional input parameter supports
a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where \"xxx\"
is the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition indicates
that the operation supports the named optional input parameter. Additionally,
each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 3:** Each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
## 6.3 partialSuspension Interface (M)
This interface defines methods for the IRPManager to request from the IRPAgent
to generally suspend the forwarding of notifications via the Itf-N for a scope
of managed object instances and all other notifications not related to managed
NRM IOC instances. For the definition of partial suspension see the
requirements document 3GPP TS 32.381 [4].
### 6.3.1 Operation setPartialSuspensionOfItfN (M)
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition
This operation allows an IRPManager to suspend the forwarding via Itf-N of
notifications generated by scoped managed object instances and all other
notifications not related to managed NRM IOC instances.
It is the IRPAgent\'s decision whether or not the suspended notifications are
logged, whether or not they go into the AlarmList.
The IRPAgent may apply a time delay before activation of the partial
suspension and inform about it in the optional output parameter activationTime
of this operation and notification notifyChangeOfPartialSuspensionOfItfN (this
allows intervention of other IRPManagers in multi-manager scenarios).

### 6.3.4 Notification notifyChangeOfPartialSuspensionOfItfN (M)
#### 6.3.4.1 Definition
This notification is sent:
\- after the IRPAgent has successfully performed a setPartialSuspensionOfItfN
request and possibly (if this is supported) before the activationTime of this
partial suspension;
\- after the IRPAgent has successfully performed a
removePartialSuspensionOfItfN request.
IRPManagers should be aware that the IRPAgent can not deliver reliable results
for some operations while partial suspension is active. Therefore the
IRPManager should not use such operations, e.g. CM and FM or TM etc.
operations in the scoped branch of the MIB, which is suspended.
This notification can also be sent to an IRPManager who nevertheless requested
an operation for an instance whose notification forwarding is suspended.
