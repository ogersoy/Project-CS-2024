Node B Subsystem (HeNS)**
The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor Home enhanced Node B
Subsystem (HeNS).
During the lifetime of HeNS, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise the
utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed through
network configuration management activities and/or network engineering, see
3GPP TS 32.600 [1].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of HeNS require data on which to base decisions. This data refers to
the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In order to
produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs, which
comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external system,
e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further evaluation. The
purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms involved in the
collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404[2] helps in the definition of new performance
measurements that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and
inclusion in the present document. Annex B of TS 32.404[2] discusses a top-
down performance measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the
end-user of performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for Home enhanced Node B
Subsystem (HeNS).\ HeNS [3] is consists of a HeNB and optionally a HeNB GW.
And, it is connected by means of the standard S1 interface to the EPC (Evolved
Packet Core), more specifically to the MME (Mobility Management Entity) by
means of the S1-MME interface and to the Serving Gateway (S-GW) by means of
the S1-U interface\ TS 32.401 [4] describes Performance Management concepts
and requirements.\ The present document is valid for all measurement types
provided by an implementation of HeNS.\ Only measurement types that are
specific to HeNS are defined within the present documents. Vendor specific
measurement types used in HeNS are not covered. Instead, these could be
applied according to manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to HeNB and HeNB GW);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. HeNB registration measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.

## 4.2 Measurements related to HeNB
### 4.2.1 Measurements related to CSG service
#### 4.2.1.1 Overview
A Closed Subscriber Group identifies subscribers of an operator who are
permitted to access one or more cells of the PLMN but which have restricted
access (CSG cells).
The CSG inbound mobility procedure provides means for UEs switching from other
cells to CSG HeNBs or to Hybrid Cells in RRC_CONNECTED mode. The procedure is
triggered when the target HeNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message from the
MME, including the CSG id and -- for handover to a hybrid cell -- CSG
Membership Status. In case the target HeNB is connected to MME through HeNB
GW, the HANDOVER REQUEST message should be sent from the HeNB GW. The
successful CSG inbound mobility rate poses an important impact on the QoE,
therefore it is essential to define related measurements
The CSG inbound mobility procedure is initiated by MME.
Performance measurement definitions in this subclause are based on 3GPP TS
36.413 [6].

###### ### Annex A: Use cases for performance measurements definition
# A.1 Use case of the SCTP signalling measurements
In order to avoid the overload of HeNB-GW, SCTP signaling measurements data
will be combined with HeNB-GW user plane measurement data to reflect load
status on HeNB-GW. When HeNB GW is present in HeNS, it is fairly a
straightforward way to collect such performance data from HeNB GW. Especially,
operators deploy a dedicated HeNS management system.
In addition, the ratio of signaling to data bandwidth usage is very useful to
monitor some abnormal events, such as if the ratio of them is too high, some
unusual events are possible happened. Therefore, the operator could analyze
whether some problems exist in the network or not, and may find out root-
causes leaded to the bad conditions, finally resolve the problems.
# A.2 Use case of HeNB-GW user plane measurements
HeNB-GW user plane related measurements are used to measure data volume on S1
interface including incoming and outgoing of data packets and octets for
GTP-U. When HeNB GW is present in HeNS, it is fairly a straightforward way to
collect such performance data from HeNB GW. Especially, operators deploy a
dedicated HeNS management system.
Based on that, the measurements are useful to analyze data volumes and
velocity from HeNB-GW point-of-view. If the data volume is too high, more
interface bandwidth should be deployed, or HeNB-GW load balance should be
considered. If data velocity is too high, the packet forwarding capacity of
HeNB-GW should be enhanced to avoid data congestion.
In addition, HeNB-GW user plane related measurements could be together with
other performance measurements to analyze network performance to find out the
abnormal events.
# A.3 CSG service related performance
A Closed Subscriber Group identifies subscribers of an operator who are
permitted to access one or more PLMN cells which have restricted access. It is
a new added feature in HeNB to facilitate the provisioning of new service. The
collection of CSG related performance on HeNB level could clearly reflects the
status of delivered service for each subscriber. In addition to this, HeNB is
an exclusive signalling terminator on the HeNS side when HeNB GW is absent.
Therefore, it is necessary to capture the CSG performance data on HeNB level.
By calculating these parameters relating to CSG service, the operator can
obtain the mean number of CSG UEs and the successful rate of inbound mobility
for UEs. The mean number of CSG UEs indicates how many users accessing the CSG
service, which is a key performance for service utilization. The successful
rate of inbound mobility for UEs performs a key indicator of CSG service
accessibility. As low handover success rate will impact user experience, it is
important to define measurements to capture handover success rate.
Furthermore, detailed analysis of handover failures is essential to know what
causes the handovers.
Based on these indicators, the operator can optimize the service coverage and
enhance the user experience.
# A.4 RRC related performance
RRC relevant performance parameters are essential to evaluate the radio link
quality. Especially, a HeNB is a kind of CPE. Depending on HeNB trail
experience, there might be serious interference happened between HeNB cell and
Macro Cell. The collection of RRC performance on each HeNB could directly to
indicate radio link quality. The collection of RRC performance is also helpful
for operator to locate the root causes if there is service faults are
occurred.
Based on that, these measurements are useful for drawing connection rate and
drop rate of HeNB system. Both rates reflect connectivity and continuity for
system services, and also direct key performance indicators of user
experience. By analysing these indicators, the operator can keep track of the
network as well as enhance user experience.
# A.5 E-RAB related performance
E-RAB management procedure includes E-RAB Setup procedure and E-RAB Release
Request procedure. The purpose of the E-RAB Setup procedure is to assign
resources on Uu and S1 for one or several E-RABs and to setup corresponding
Data Radio Bearers for a given UE. Based on the _E-RAB level QoS parameters_
IE the HeNB shall establish a Data Radio Bearer and allocate the required
resources on Uu. If E-RABs are failed to be established, the involved services
may fail. Therefore, the collection on per E-RAB QCI will give operators
important indications whether a particular service type is running well or
not. Especially, operators deliver some new feature services to customers.
During daily maintenance of network, measurements regarding E-RAB
establishment and release are useful for operators to evaluate E-RAB
management procedures, to analyze failure reasons of E-RAB establishment and
to analyze the causes of E-RAB release. In addition, the E-RAB performance
data on per QCI could give operators possibilities to assess the quality of
specific service.
Based on that, these measurements are useful for drawing connection rate and
drop rate of HeNB system. Both rates reflect connectivity and continuity for
system services, and also direct key performance indicators of user
experience. By analysing these indicators, the operator can keep track of the
network as well as enhance user experience.
# A.6 Handover related performance
In telecommunications, the term handover refers to the process of transferring
an ongoing call or data session from one channel connected to the core network
to another, which can be categorized according to RATs.
During daily maintenance of network, it is essential in network operations to
follow the success rate of various handover. Low handover success rate will
impact user experience, therefore it is important to define measurements to
follow handover success rate.
By calculating these parameters, we can obtain the success rate of handovers
for UEs, both eNBs and inter-RAT related. All these parameters are direct key
indicators of service connectivity and also useful for operators to evaluate
handover procedures and analyze failure reasons. To go for further analysis of
handover failures, it is also essential to know what causes the handovers. By
analysing these indicators, the operator can inspect the network as well as
enhance user experience.
# A.7 Radio bearer QoS related performance
A fundamental measure of QoS is the throughput (data rate) of the cell. The
total cell throughput measured across all radio bearers gives an indication of
the loading and activity in the cell. Adding a per QCI counter allows the
loading on the different QCIs to be measured. For example, if QCI 1 is used
exclusively for VoIP then the loading of conversational speech can be directly
determined. The maximum throughput can indicate to the operator whether there
is enough capacity in the network. Separate counters should be configured on
the downlink and uplink. The PDCP SDU bit-rate helps to evaluate the usage of
bandwidth and radio resource. Operators could perform network optimization
based on the throughput statistics. Hence it is important to monitor the total
cell throughput.
# A.8 Packet delay, drop rate and loss rate related performance
Latency is of prime concern for some services, particularly conversational
services like speech and instant messaging. A counter is added to measure the
mean delay for IP packets incurred within the HeNB. Separate counters are
provided per QCI which are particularly useful when the QCI is used by very
few services and the packet sizes vary little. It is only practical to measure
packet delays on the downlink.
When a cell is heavily loaded congestion can take place. When congestion is
not severe the impact is typically the incurrence of additional delay for non-
GBR radio bearers. However, when congestion is severe the HeNB may be forced
to discard packets. It is important for the operator to have visibility of
packet discard so that corrective action can be instigated (for example, by
adjusting admission control settings in the network). It is only practical to
measure packet discards on the downlink. Packet discards on handover should
not be included in the count.
The downlink air interface packet loss can be directly compared with the PELR
value of a QCI to see if the packet loss (over the air interface) aspect of
quality of service is being met within the cell. On the downlink this
measurement can be added to the congestion losses (see DL packet drop rate) to
determine the total packet loss rate at the HeNB. Consequently, the downlink
useful bit-rate can be estimated by scaling the measurement of the downlink
PDCP ingress bit-rate by (1 -- DL packet drop rate) (1 -- air interface packet
loss rate).
The uplink air interface packet loss rate (per QCI) can be compared directly
with the PELR defined for that QCI. An estimate of the uplink air interface
packet loss may be provided by the "Uplink PDCP SDU loss rate". This uplink
measurement is based on PDCP sequence numbers and cannot precisely measure the
air interface losses. Any packets discarded by the UE within the protocol
stack (i.e. at layer 2) are also counted since they will have been given a
PDCP sequence number. Discards at layer 3 are not counted.
