# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32**.111-1** \"Fault Management; Part 1: 3G fault management requirements\".
**32.111-2 \"Fault Management; Part 2: Alarm Integration Reference Point
(IRP): Information Service (IS)\".**
32**.111-6** \"Fault Management; Part 6: Alarm Integration Reference Point
(IRP): Solution Set (SS) definitions.
The present document is part of a set of TSs which describes the requirements
and information model necessary for the Telecommunication Management (TM) of
3GPP systems. The TM principles and TM architecture are specified in 3GPP TS
32.101 [6] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [7].
A 3GPP system is composed of a multitude of Network Elements (NE) of various
types and, typically, different vendors inter-operate in a co-ordinated manner
in order to satisfy the network users\' communication requirements.\ The
occurrence of failures in a NE may cause a deterioration of this NE\'s
function and/or service quality and will, in severe cases, lead to the
complete unavailability of the NE. In order to minimize the effects of such
failures on the Quality of Service (QoS) as perceived by the network users it
is necessary to:
\- detect failures in the network as soon as they occur and alert the
operating personnel as fast as possible;
isolate the failures (autonomously or through operator intervention), i.e.
switch off faulty units and, if applicable, limit the effect of the failure as
much as possible by reconfiguration of the faulty NE/adjacent NEs;
\- if necessary, determine the cause of the failure using diagnosis and test
routines; and,
\- repair/eliminate failures in due time through the application of
maintenance procedures.
This aspect of the management environment is termed \"Fault Management\" (FM).
The purpose of FM is to detect failures as soon as they occur and to limit
their effects on the network QoS as far as possible.\ The latter is achieved
by bringing additional/redundant equipment into operation, reconfiguring
existing equipment/NEs, or by repairing/eliminating the cause of the failure.
Fault Management (FM) encompasses all of the above functionalities except
commissioning/decommissioning of NEs and potential operator triggered
reconfiguration (these are a matter of Configuration Management).
FM also includes associated features in the Operations System (OS), such as
the administration of alarm list, the presentation of operational state
information of physical and logical devices/resources/functions, and the
provision and analysis of the alarm and state history of the network.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the Alarm Integration Reference Point (IRP)
Information Service (IS), which addresses the alarm surveillance aspects of
Fault Management (FM), applied to the Itf-N.
The purpose of the AlarmIRP is to define an interface through which a
\"system\" (typically a Network Element Manager or a Network Element) can
communicate alarm information for its managed objects to one or several
Manager Systems (typically Network Management Systems).
The Alarm IRP IS defines the semantics of alarms and the interactions visible
across the reference point in a protocol neutral way. It defines the semantics
of the operations and notifications visible in the IRP. It does not define the
syntax or encoding of the operations, notifications and their parameters.

## 5.2 Class diagram
### 5.2.0 Introduction
This clause introduces the set of classes (i.e. IOCs, SupportIOCs) that
encapsulate information within the AlarmIRP. The intent is to identify the
information required for the AlarmIRP implementation of its operations and
notification emission. This clause provides the overview of all support object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these support object classes.

## 5.3 Information Object Class Definitions
### 5.3.1 AlarmInformation
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
AlarmInformation contains information about alarm condition of an alarmed
MonitoredEntity.
One AlarmIRP is related to at most one AlarmList. The IRPAgent or its related
AlarmIRP or the related AlarmList assigns an identifier, called alarmId, to
each AlarmInformation in the AlarmList. An alarmId unambiguously identifies
one AlarmInformation in the AlarmList.
#### 5.3.1.2 Attribute
+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | Attribute name | Support Qualifier | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | alarmId | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | notificationId | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | alarmRaisedTime | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | alarmClearedTime | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | alarmChangedTime | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | eventType | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | probableCause | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | perceivedSeverity | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | rootCauseIndicator | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | specificProblem | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | backedUpStatus | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | trendIndication | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | thresholdInfo | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | stateChangeDefinition | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | monitoredAttributes | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | proposedRepairActions | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | additionalText | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | additionalInformation | O(see note 4) | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | ackTime | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | ackUserId | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | ackSystemId | O | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | ackState | M | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | clearUserId | O (see note 2) | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | clearSystemId | O (see note 2) | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | serviceUser | O (see note 3) | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | serviceProvider | O (see note 3) | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | securityAlarmDetector | O (see note 3) | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+ | NOTE 1: Void. | | | | | | NOTE 2: These attributes and qualifiers are | | | applicable only if the IRPAgent supports | | | clearAlarms() (they are absent if clearAlarms() | | | is not supported). | | | | | | NOTE 3: These attributes must be supported if | | | the IRPAgent emits notifyNewAlarm that carries | | | security alarm information. | | | | | | NOTE 4: This attribute is optionally populated | | | whenever vendor specific attributes are | | | needed.\ | | | A specific condition for this optional | | | population is when an alarm presented by the EM | | | (e.g. EM user interface) has different values | | | of perceived severity, and / or alarm type, | | | compared with the values presented to the | | | Itf-N. | | +-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+
#### 5.3.1.3 State diagram
Alarms have states. The alarm state information is captured in
AlarmInformation in AlarmList.
The solid circle icon represents the Start State. The double circle icon
represents the End State. In this state, the alarm is Cleared and
acknowledged. The AlarmInformation shall not be accessible via the IRP and is
removed from the AlarmList.
Note the state diagram uses \" X / Y \^ Z \" to label the arc that indicates
state transition. The meanings of X, Y and Z are:
\- X identifies the triggering event
\- Y identifies the action of AlarmIRP because of the triggering event
\- Z is the notification to be emitted by AlarmIRP because of the triggering
event
Note that acknowledgeAlarm\^notifyAckStateChanged and the
unacknowledgeAlarm\^notifyAckStateChange refer to cases when the request of
the IRPManager is successful for the AlarmInformation concerned. They do not
refer to the cases when the request is a failure since in the failure cases,
no state transition would occur.
Note that, to reduce cluttering to the diagram, the setComment\^notifyComment
is not included in the figure. One transition should be applied from
unack&unclear to itself. Similarly, another transition should be applied from
ack&unclear to itself. Another one is from unack&clear to itself.
\"PS\" used in the state diagram stands for \"perceived severity\".
Figure A is used if it supports \^notifyChangedAlarm and Figure B is used if
it does not support \^notifyChangedAlarm.
Figure A. \^notifyChangedAlarm supported
Figure B. \^notifyChangedAlarm not supported
### 5.3.2 AlarmList
#### 5.3.2.1 Definition
AlarmIRP maintains an AlarmList that contains currently active alarms (i.e.
AlarmInformation whose perceivedSeverity is not Cleared) and alarms that are
Cleared but not yet acknowledged.
#### 5.3.2.2 Attribute
There is no additional attribute defined for this class besides those
inherited.
### 5.3.3 AlarmIRP
#### 5.3.3.1 Definition
AlarmIRP is the representation of the alarm management capabilities specified
by the present document. This class inherits from ManagedGenericIRP class
specified in 3GPP TS 32.312 [14].
#### 5.3.3.2 Attribute
There is no additional attribute defined for this class besides those
inherited.
#### 5.3.3.3 Notification Table
* * *
Name Qualifier Notes notifyAlarmListRebuilt M See 6.8.4.
notifyPotentialFaultyAlarmList O See 6.11.1.
* * *
### 5.3.4 Comment
#### 5.3.4.1 Definition
Comment contains commentary and associated information such as the time when
the commentary is made.
#### 5.3.4.2 Attribute
* * *
Attribute Name Support Qualifier commentTime M commentText M commentUserId M
commentSystemId O
* * *
### 5.3.5 CorrelatedNotification
#### 5.3.5.1 Definition
It identifies one MonitoredEntity. For that MonitoredEntity identified, a set
of notification identifiers is also identified. One or more
CorrelatedNotification instances can be related to an AlarmInformation. In
this case, the information of the AlarmInformation is said to be correlated to
information carried in the notifications identified by the
CorrelatedNotification instances. See further definition of correlated
notification in ITU-T Recommendation X.733 [2], clause 8.1.2.9.
The notification identified by the CorrelatedNotification, as defined in ITU-T
and used here, can carry all types of information and not restricted to
carrying alarm information only (see TS 32.302 [5]). For example, a
notification, identified by the CorrelatedNotification, can indicate a managed
instance attribute value change. In this case, the information of the
AlarmInformation is said to be correlated to the managed instance attribute
value change event.
The meaning of correlation is dependent on the type of notification itself.
See the comment column of the correlatedNotification input parameter for each
type of notification, such as notifyNewAlarm.
Notification carries AlarmInformation. The AlarmInformation instances referred
to by the correlatedNotification may or may not exist in the AlarmList. For
example, the AlarmInformation carried by the identified notification may have
been acknowledged and Cleared and therefore, no longer exist in the AlarmList.

### 5.3.6 MonitoredEntity
#### 5.3.6.1 Definition
It represents classes that can have an alarmed state. The types of classes
that can have alarmed state are:
> a) All classes whose Notification Tables include alarm notifications.
>
> b) VSE subclass of 3GPP defined classes and VSE defined classes that can
> have alarmed state.
The objectClass and objectInstance of this class identifies an instance of
this class. The AlarmInformation uses this information in two places. In one
place, the information is used to identify the instance that is in alarmed
state. In another place, the information is used to identify an instance that
can be used as the back up network resource for the instance that is in
alarmed state.
#### 5.3.6.2 Attribute
There is no attribute for this class.

{width="5.479861111111111in" height="3.6166666666666667in"}
## 6.2 Generic rules
Rule 1: each operation with at least one input parameter supports a pre-
condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
Rule 2: Each operation with at least one optional input parameter supports a
set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where \"xxx\" is
the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition indicates that
the operation supports the named optional input parameter. Additionally, each
such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
Rule 3: each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem that is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.

#### 6.3.1.6 Exceptions
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Name | Definition | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | operation_failed | **Condition:** Pre-condition is false or | | | post-condition is false. | | | | | | **Returned Information:** The output parameter | | | status. | | | | | | **Exit state:** Entry state. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
### 6.3.2 getAlarmList (M)
#### 6.3.2.1 Definition
The IRPManager invokes this operation to request the AlarmIRP to provide
either the complete list of AlarmInformation instances in the AlarmList or
only a part of this list (partial alarm alignment).
The parameters baseObjectClass and baseObjectInstance are used to identify the
part of the alarm list to be returned. If they are absent, then the complete
alarm list shall be provided (full alarm alignment). If they identify a
particular class instance, then only a) the AlarmInformation instances related
to this class instance and b) the AlarmInformation instances related to the
subordinate class instances of this class instance shall be provided (partial
alarm alignment). An instance-a is said to be subordinate to instance-b if the
DN of the latter is part of the DN of the former.
There are two modes of operation. One mode is synchronous. In this mode, the
list of AlarmInformation instances in AlarmList is returned synchronously with
the operation. The other mode is asynchronous. In this mode, the list of
AlarmInformation instances is returned via notifications. In asynchronous mode
of operation, the only information returned synchronously is the status of the
operation. A method allowing to abort an ongoing alarm alignment process shall
be available in the asynchronous mode. The mode of operation to be used is
determined by means outside the scope of specification. To use asynchronous
mode, the IRPManager must have established a subscription with the
NotificationIRP via the subscribe operation specified in 3GPP TS 32.302 [5].

## 6.8 Notification AlarmIRPNotifications_1 (M)
### 6.8.0 Introduction
The present document does not specify methods for IRPManager to detect alarm
loss. The use of alarmId to detect alarm loss is an arrangement made between
IRPAgent and IRPManager. The use of such arrangement is outside the scope of
the present document. For example, IRPAgent may use integer sequence (e.g. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, ...) as alarmId instances for its alarms. Based on this knowledge,
IRPManager can detect alarm loss. This kind of arrangement may not be possible
for all SS.
The present document does not specify how IRPAgent can determine if IRPManager
has received alarms correctly. Not all SSs provide such capability.
The present document does not specify methods for IRPManager and IRPAgent to
recover alarm loss. The only mechanism recommended to deal with alarm loss is
the use of getAlarmList operation. The present document does not specify
conditions under which IRPManager should invoke this operation.
The filter qualifiers in tables listing input parameters of notifications only
refer to applying a filter constraint to that notification. In other words:
The filter qualifiers Y(es)/N(o) specify if the input parameter can be used or
not when constructing the input parameter filter of operations subscribe or
changeSubscriptionFilter defined in 3GPP TS 32.302 [5].
### 6.8.1 notifyNewAlarm (M)
#### 6.8.1.1 Definition
A new AlarmInformation has been added in the AlarmList. The subscribed
IRPManager instances are notified of this fact if the added AlarmInformation
satisfies the current filter constraint of their subscription.
There are two tables for Input Parameters. If alarmType parameter indicates
\"Communications Alarm\", \"Processing Error Alarm\", \"Environmental Alarm\".
\"Quality Of Service Alarm\" or \"Equipment Alarm\", the first table (see
clause 6.8.1.2) shall be applicable for this notifyNewAlarm. If alarmType
parameter indicates \"Integrity Violation\", \"Operational Violation\",
\"Physical Violation\", \"Security Service or Mechanism Violation\" or \"Time
Domain Violation\", the second table (see clause 6.8.1.3) shall be applicable.

### 6.8.2 notifyAckStateChanged (M)
#### 6.8.2.1 Definition
The subscribed IRPManager instances are notified regarding changes in alarm
Acknowledgement State. The AlarmInformation carried in the notification shall
satisfy the current filter constraint of the subscription.
The notification shall contain all parameters that are filterable and are
present in the original (related) notifyNewAlarm notification.
The IRPManager and the EM can acknowledge and unacknowledge alarms as defined
by 3GPP TS 32.111-1 [9]. Specifically, the AlarmIRP itself can acknowledge
alarms.
The capability that IRPAgent itself acknowledges alarms is optional. The
trigger, of such capability, is vendor defined. For example, it runs once a
day, once every 4 hours, or always. The algorithm for determining which
cleared alarm should be acknowledged is vendor specific. For example:
acknowledge alarm records that have been cleared more than 24 hours or
acknowledge alarm records whose highest perceived severity level has been
MINOR. When acknowledged, the alarm ackState changes and the AlarmIRP shall
emit the corresponding notifyAckStateChanged.

## 6.11 Notification AlarmIRPNotification_4 (O)
### 6.11.1 notifyPotentialFaultyAlarmList (M)
#### 6.11.1.1 Definition
The IRPAgent or its related AlarmIRP maintains an AlarmList. They can lose
confidence in the integrity of its AlarmList. Under this condition, IRPAgent
or its related AlarmIRP or the related AlarmList shall invoke
notifyPotentialFaultyAlarmList. They then can begin to rebuild the faulty
AlarmList, if found necessary. After the successful rebuilt or the discovery
that rebuilt is not necessary, they shall invoke notifyAlarmListRebuilt
notification.
This notification can identify a set of AlarmInformation that is potentially
faulty or unreliable. This identification is done in the following way. If the
MOI of an AlarmInformation is the same or is a subordinate to the MOI carried
in the notification, then the AlarmInformation may be faulty or unreliable.
This notification can identify all the AlarmInformation instances of the
AlarmList that are potentially faulty or unreliable. In this case, the
notification shall carry a MOI identifying the IRPAgent.
The IRPManager behaviour, on reception of this notifyPotentialFaultyAlarmList
notification, is not specified. The IRPManager behaviour is considered not
essential for the specification of the interface itself. However, the
following are recommended actions the IRPManager should take, in case it
receives this notification.
1) The IRPManager should not perform any task requiring the integrity of the
AlarmInformation identified as faulty or unreliable by the subject
notification.
2) The IRPManager should not invoke operations that require integrity of the
AlarmList such as getAlarmList., acknolwedgeAlarms operations.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Event Types
This annex lists and explains event types used by the present document.
The table below lists the event types referred to in the present document.
Notification IRP: Information Service in 3GPP TS 32.302 [5] defines a
parameter called notificationType that shall be present in all notification.
The present document defines a parameter called alarmType that shall be
present in all notifications carrying alarm information. Examples of the
notificationType are \"notification of new alarm\", \"notification of
AlarmList rebuilt\", \"notification of alarm cleared\", etc. Examples of the
alarmType are the event types defined in table below.
The present document also defines an attribute of AlarmInformation called
eventType. The mapping of this eventType (internal attribute and not visible
to IRPManager) to notificationType or alarmType (both visible to IRPManager)
is defined in relevant sections of the present document. The choice of using
\"eventType\" is to keep the list of attributes of AlarmList unchanged
(compared to Release 99). One can replace this eventType with two attributes,
called notificationType and alarmType so that mapping of these two attributes
to the externally visible parameters of the same name will be straight-
forward.
It is noted that the mapping of the IS notificationType and alarmType to CORBA
event_name or other fields are specified in the respective Solution Set.
Table A.1: Event Types
* * *
Event Types Explanation Communications Alarm An alarm of this type is
associated with the procedure and/or process required conveying information
from one point to another (ITU-T Recommendation X.733 [2]). Processing Error
Alarm An alarm of this type is associated with a software or processing fault
(ITUâ€‘T Recommendation X.733 [2]). Environmental Alarm An alarm of this type is
associated with a condition related to an enclosure in which the equipment
resides (ITU-T Recommendation X.733 [2]). Quality of Service Alarm An alarm of
this type is associated with degradation in the quality of a service (ITUâ€‘T
Recommendation X.733 [2]). Equipment Alarm An alarm of this type is associated
with an equipment fault (ITU-T Recommendation X.733 [2]). Integrity Violation
An indication that information may have been illegally modified, inserted or
deleted. Operational Violation An indication that the provision of the
requested service was not possible due to the unavailability, malfunction or
incorrect invocation of the service. Physical Violation An indication that a
physical resource has been violated in a way that suggests a security attack.
Security Service or Mechanism Violation An indication that a security attack
has been detected by a security service or mechanism. Time Domain Violation An
indication that an event has occurred at an unexpected or prohibited time.
* * *
###### ## Annex B (normative): Probable Causes
This annex lists probable causes and their corresponding event types.
Sources of these probable causes are ITU-T Recommendation M.3100 [11], ITU-T
Recommendation X.721 [3], ITUâ€‘T Recommendation X.733 [2], and ITU-T
Recommendation X.736 [15]. In addition, probable causes for wireless systems
are listed in ETSI TS 101 251 V6.3.0 (1999-07) [18].

###### ## Annex C (informative): Examples of using notifyChangedAlarm
This annex describes a number of valid and invalid interactions governing the
case when IRPAgent is reporting a specific fault of a particular network
resource whose alarm severity level changes from, e.g. \"Critical\" to
\"Minor\" and then to \"Cleared\".
In the following examples:
> ni is notificationId,
>
> moc is managedObjectClass,
>
> moi is managedObjectInstance,
>
> et is eventType,
>
> pc is probableCause,
>
> sp is specificProblem,
>
> ps is perceivedSeverity and
>
> ai is alarmId.
EXAMPLE 1: Valid sequence of a hypothetical case:
(1) NotifyNewAlarm
> (ni=1, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Critical)
(2) NotifyChangedAlarm
> (ni=2, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Minor)
(3) NotifyClearedAlarm
> (ni=3, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Cleared)
EXAMPLE 2: Valid sequence of a hypothetical case (assuming that the alarm with
\"ai=X\" is acknowledged after either (1) or (2), but before (3)):
(1) NotifyNewAlarm
> (ni=1, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Critical)
(2) NotifyClearedAlarm
> (ni=2, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Cleared)
(3) NotifyNewAlarm
> (ni=3, ai=Y, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Minor)
(4) NotifyClearedAlarm
> (ni=4, ai=Y, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Cleared)
EXAMPLE 3: Invalid sequence of a hypothetical case:
(1) NotifyNewAlarm
> (ni=1, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Critical)
(2) NotifyChangedAlarm
> (ni=2, ai=Y, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Minor)
(3) NotifyClearedAlarm
> (ni=3, ai=Y, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Cleared)
Interaction (2) is illegal since it uses a different ai for the same alarm. It
should use ai=X as in interaction (1).
EXAMPLE 4: Invalid sequenceof a hypothetical case:
(1) NotifyNewAlarm
> (ni=1, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Critical)
(2) NotifyNewAlarm
> (ni=2, ai=X, moc=A, moi=B, et=C, pc=D, sp=E, ps=Minor)
Interaction (2) is illegal since it invokes notifyNewAlarm using same ai
value. It should use notifyChangedAlarm with the same ai value.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Examples of using correlatedNotification
This annex describes a number of examples of when the IRPAgent is indicating
that several alarms are correlated.
EXAMPLE 1: Alarms X and Y are correlated, but the root cause is unknown.
> Information of AlarmInformation X has been captured in a notification whose
> identifier is "x".
>
> AlarmInformation X holds a relation to a CorrelatedNotification instance
> which has the following attribute values
>
> source="ABC"
>
> notificationIdSet carries the identifier "y"
>
> X.rootCauseIndicator="No"
>
> Information of AlarmInformation Y has been captured in a notification whose
> identifier is "y".
>
> Optionally, AlarmInformation Y may hold a relation to a
> correlatedNotification instance which has the following attribute values
>
> source="DEF"
>
> notificationIdSet carries the identifier "x"
>
> Y.rootCauseIndicator="No"
EXAMPLE 2: Alarms X and Y are correlated, where Alarm X is the root cause of
Alarm Y.
> Information of AlarmInformation X has been captured in a notification whose
> identifier is "x".
>
> AlarmInformation X holds a relation to a correlatedNotification instance
> which has the following attribute values
>
> source="ABC"
>
> notificationIdSet carries the identifier "y"
>
> X.rootCauseIndicator="Yes"
>
> Information of AlarmInformation Y has been captured in a notification whose
> identifier is "y".
>
> Optionally, AlarmInformation Y may hold a relation to a
> correlatedNotification instance which has the following attribute values
>
> source="DEF"
>
> notificationIdSet carries the identifier "x"
>
> Y.rootCauseIndicator="No"
###### ## Annex E (informative): AcknowledgeAlarms operation scenario
The acknowledgeAlarms operation may optionally include perceivedSeverity as
input parameter.
The reason for using perceivedSeverity in the acknowledgeAlarms operation is
to avoid an undesirable consequence. An example sequence of events is:
  1. IRPAgent AlarmList has alarmId=6 with perceivedSeverity=minor
  2. IRPManager issues getAlarmList
  3. IRPAgent updates alarmId=6 with perceivedSeverity=critical
  4. In case IRPAgent have not issued the notifyChangedAlarm in time or in the case IRPManager ignores the notifyChangedAlarm received, for examples...
  5. IRPManager issues acknowledgeAlarms of alarmId=6 with perceivedSeverity=minor
  6. IRPAgent rejects acknowledgement, with reason WrongPerceivedSeverity
> If the optional perceivedSeverity input parameter was not used in step 5, in
> step 6 the IRPAgent would have accepted the acknowledgement, with the
> undesirable consequences:
  * IRPManager wrongly concludes that it had acknowledged alarm=6 with perceivedSeverity=minor.
  * IRPAgent wrongly concludes that alarmId=6 with perceivedSeverity=critical had been acknowledged.
  * Other IRPManagers will see alarmId=6 with perceivedSeverity=critical being acknowledged (and possibly taken care of) by an IRPManager.
