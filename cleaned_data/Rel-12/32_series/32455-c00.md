###### ## Annex A (informative): Use case for KPIs
## A.1 Use case for EPS attach success rate related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by EPS. EPS
attachment for a UE/user is important when they access network. If users or
subscribers cannot attach to the PS network of EPS, they cannot access EPS.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
## A.2 Use case for inter-RAT handover related KPIs
Inter RAT handover success rate is used to evaluate stability and reliability
performance of handover between EPS and GSM or UMTS or CDMA2000. If the KPI
value is too low, call drop rate may be increased. This KPI is focusing on
network and user view.
## A.3 Use case for mean active dedicated EPS bearer utilization related KPI
Mean active dedicated EPS bearer utilization can be used to indicate system
load level. If the value of this KPI is very high, it indicates system
capacity is not enough, and needs to be increased. So it is an important
indicator for EPC network optimization.
This KPI is focusing on network view.
## A.4 Use case for dedicated EPS bearer creation success rate related KPI
If PGW can not create the dedicated bearer, then users cannot use the services
provided by EPS successfully, which will influence the users' satisfactory to
the network. So it is necessary to define dedicated EPS bearer creation
success rate to evaluate accessibility performance provided by EPS and network
performance, user behaviour is included.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
## A.5 Use case for mean dedicated bearer set-up time by MME related KPI
Mean dedicated bearer set-up time by MME can be used to describe the duration
between a UE requests a service and the service is successfully established,
it can reflect the user satisfactory of high data rate service and network
performance of dedicated bearer set-up. So it is useful to evaluate
accessibility performance provided by EPS and network performance.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
## A.6 Use case for service request success rate related KPI
Service Request procedure is one of the important NAS procedures which is
triggered by the UE when it is in idle state and has some data to send or
receive (after the paging procedure). If the service request success rate is
lower than predefined threshold, the user experience of sending / receiving
the data will be affected. So it is necessary to define service request
success rate, the user behaviour is included.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
## A.7 Use case for tracking area update success rate related KPI
Tracking area update success rate is useful to evaluate mobility provided by
EPS. If a user fails to update the tracking area, the user may not be paged by
network because the target tracking area can not be attached. If the tracking
area update success rate is lower than a predefined threshold, the tracking
areas maybe need to be re-planed. So it is necessary to define the tracking
area update success rate, the user behaviour is included.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
