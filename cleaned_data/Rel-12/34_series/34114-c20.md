# 1 Scope
The present document describes the test procedure for the radiated
performances measurements of the 3G/2G user equipment/mobile stations (UE/MS)
in active mode in both the uplink and the downlink. The FDD UE test procedure
is based on the test method developed as a result of COST 273 Sub-Working
Group (SWG) 2.2 members' contributions. Background work has also been made in
the former COST259 project. The TDD UE test procedure is based on the test
method developed as a result of CCSA TC9 WG1 members' contributions.
Background work has been made in the former CCSA TC9 project.
The measurement procedure explained in this document applies to UE/MS used
under the "speech mode" conditions that correspond to predefined positions for
voice application when the handset is held close to the user's head. This
method is also applicable to free space measurements for UE/MS devices. The
data transfer position (free space) explained in this document applies when
the UE is used away from the user's head. For LME and LEE devices free space
configuration without head and hand phantoms is applicable. Free space
measurements are applicable to devices used in the data transfer position that
consist of the laptop mounted equipment (LME) plug-in UEs and laptop embedded
equipment (LEE) UEs.
The tests apply to UEs and laptops using single or multiple receive antennas.
For GSM technology this is applicable to all MSs and for 3G technology this is
applicable to "one antenna" UEs and "RxDiversity" UEs.
The testing methodology applies to any single or multi-mode (GSM / UMTS / TD-
SCDMA) terminals.
The radio tests considered here are:
1\. The measurement of the Total Radiated Power (TRP)
2\. The measurement of the Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS)
The test procedure described in this document measures the performance of the
transmitter and the receiver, including the antenna and also the effects of
the user.
The major parts of this test procedure are based on the 3-D pattern
measurement method. It has been considered necessary to define some items and
components in the test procedure in detail, such as test channels and phantom
set-ups, in order to make the testing in different laboratories harmonized.
The procedure is, however, not limited to some specific antenna chambers or
positioners.

# 4 General
The present document describes test procedure for the radiated performances

mode in both the up- and the downlink. The test procedure is based on 3GPP TR
25.914 [1].
## 4.1 Measurement frequencies
The radiation patterns of handset antennas can be expected to be frequency
dependent, both in the size and, to smaller extent, in the shape of the
pattern. TRP and TRS shall be measured in 3 channels in a frequency band, i.e.
low, mid and high channels.

# 5 Transmitter Performance
## 5.1 General
This section specifies the test method and test requirements for the radiated
power measurement. There are two methods described. The main method is based
on an anechoic chamber approach and the alternative method is based on a
reverberation chamber approach.
### 5.1.1 DUT positioning
The DUT positioning on head phantom means that the measurements are performed
so that the DUT is placed against a SAM phantom. The characteristics of the
SAM phantom are specified in Annex A.1.1. The DUT is attached to the SAM
phantom in "cheek" position as defined in IEEE Std 1528. The DUT performance
is measured on left and right side of the head.
The DUT positioning on laptop ground plane phantom means that a laptop ground
plane phantom is used for radiated performance measurements in case of plug-in
DUT like USB dongles that is used away from the user's head. The DUT is
connected to the USB connector of the laptop ground plane phantom. The
characteristics of the laptop ground plane phantom are specified in Annex
A.1.2. The objective of the laptop ground plane phantom is to reproduce the
effects of the ground plane for the antenna of the DUT while avoiding the
variation of the measurements introduced by a real laptop. The DUT shall be
plugged into the USB connector and positioned in accordance with the
manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation the DUT with either the rotary USB porter or non-rotary USB
porter should be horizontally plugged into the horizontal USB connector.
The DUT positioning in a free space configuration without head and hand
phantoms as specified in Annex A.4 is used for radiated performance
measurements in case of embedded module card that is used away from the user's
head.
### 5.1.2 Sampling grid
A 15°-sample grid in both azimuth and elevation can be considered sufficient
for accurate measurements. Generally it can be said that since the radiating
object has a limited size the gain pattern cannot change arbitrarily versus
angle, and therefore only a limited number of samples are required to
represent the gain pattern to a given accuracy.
Alternatively, different sampling patterns may be used, if they are able to
ensure same or greater accuracy. The TRP can be calculated by interpolating
the values to points on the regular grid. If an alternative sampling pattern
is used number of measurement points should be greater than in the regular
sampling grid.
### 5.1.3 Number of independent samples (for reverberation chamber procedure)
When measuring the TRP in an isotropic Rayleigh fading environment, 100
independent samples can be considered sufficient for ensuring an expanded
accuracy better than 0.5 dB.
## 5.2 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for FDD UE
### 5.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE/MS. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE/MS for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 7 and later releases.
### 5.2.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in beside head position shall be
higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table
5.2.1. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results of both
right and left side of the phantom head.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the columns
"Min".

### 5.2.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
### 5.2.4 Method of test
#### 5.2.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a
bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for
more information see 3GPP TS 34.121 chapter 5.2. The period of measurement
shall be at least one timeslot. Also care should be taken that the noise floor
of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power measurement.
Test environment: normal; see TS34.121-1 [3] clause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see TS34.121-1 [3]
clause G.2.4.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table 5.2.2.
Set the DPCH power such that there will not be transmission gaps due to too
low signal strength throughout the measurement.
2) Power on the UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2. Compressed mode
shall be set to OFF.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode 2 and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [10] and TS 34.109 [11] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

Test dependent power
* * *
#### 5.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE against the SAM phantom
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from chapter 5.2.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Section 5.1.2). All the EIRP samples
are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 5.2.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE against the SAM phantom
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see section 5.1.3) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from section 5.2.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE/MS to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment
with uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted
by the DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed
measurement antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
### 5.2.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in beside head position shall be
higher than test performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table
5.2.3. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results of both
right and left side of the phantom head.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the columns
"Min".

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has
been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex D.
## 5.3 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for GSM MS
### 5.3.1 Definition and applicability

radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$

### 5.3.4 Method of test
#### 5.3.4.1 Initial conditions
A call is set up by the SS according to the generic call set up procedure on a
channel with ARFCN in the Mid ARFCN range, power control level set to Max
power. MS TXPWR_MAX_CCH is set to the maximum value supported by the Power
Class of the Mobile under test.
The SS sends Standard Test Signal C1; see TS51.010-1 [9] Annex A5.2.
The downlink power is set such that there will not be transmission gaps due to
too low signal strength throughout the measurement
Test environment: normal condition; see TS51.010-1 [9] Annex A1.2.2.
#### 5.3.4.2 Procedure
1) Position the MS against the SAM phantom
2) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
3) Calculate TRP using equations from chapter 5.3.1
4) Test steps 1 to 3 is repeated for ARFCN in the low and high range
NOTE 1: Measurement of normal burst transmitter output power. The SS takes
power measurement samples evenly distributed over the duration of one burst
with a sampling rate of at least 2/T, where T is the bit duration. The samples
are identified in time with respect to the modulation on the burst. The SS
identifies the centre of the useful 147 transmitted bits, i.e. the transition
from bit 13 to bit 14 of the midamble, as the timing reference
NOTE 2: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a closed surface enclosing the DUT. The
EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta (θ)
and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid can be used to
speed up the measurements (See Section 5.1.2). All the EIRP samples are taken
with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 3: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 4: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements can be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.

## 5.4 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for TDD UE
### 5.4.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where Ω is the solid angle describing the direction, _f_ is frequency.
$\theta$and$\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
$\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$are the actually transmitted
power-levels in corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas _N_ and _M_ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$and$\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the UE/MS. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the UE/MS for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 8 and later releases.
### 5.4.2 Minimum Requirements

higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table

## 5.5 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for FDD UE using LME
Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are either
missing or not yet determined:
  * The TRP Minimum Performance Requirement for this test are undefined
  * The Test Requirements and related Test Tolerances applicable for this test are undefined
### 5.5.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in

Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta

intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LME. The measurement of transmitter performance in an

of the LME for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute

where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed

measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LME.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward UE's
supporting LME feature.

## 5.6 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for GSM MS using LME
Editor's note: This test case is not completed
  * Minimum Requirements are missing
  * Test requirements and related TT are missing
### 5.6.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LME. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LME for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of LME that support GSM for
Release 11 and later releases.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward MS's
supporting LME feature.
### 5.6.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel of the LME in the data transfers
position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming
bands shown in Table 5.6.1. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for
the TRP results.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel in the data transfers
position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the
columns "Min".

### 5.6.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$ of the MS is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
### 5.6.4 Method of test
#### 5.6.4.1 Initial conditions
A call is set up by the SS according to the generic call set up procedure on a
channel with ARFCN in the Mid ARFCN range, power control level set to Max
power. MS TXPWR_MAX_CCH is set to the maximum value supported by the Power
Class of the Mobile under test.
The SS sends Standard Test Signal C1; see TS51.010-1 [9] Annex A5.2.
The downlink power is set such that there will not be transmission gaps due to
too low signal strength throughout the measurement
The LME shall be tested using the Laptop Ground Plane Phantom as described in
Annex A.1.2.
Test environment: normal condition; see TS51.010-1 [9] Annex A1.2.2.
#### 5.6.4.2 Procedure
1) Position the LME using the Laptop Ground Plane Phantom described in annex
A.1.2 and according to DUT positioning described in clause 5.1.1.
2) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
3) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 5.6.1
4) Test steps 1 to 3 is repeated for ARFCN in the low and high range
NOTE 1: Measurement of normal burst transmitter output power. The SS takes
power measurement samples evenly distributed over the duration of one burst
with a sampling rate of at least 2/T, where T is the bit duration. The samples
are identified in time with respect to the modulation on the burst. The SS
identifies the centre of the useful 147 transmitted bits, i.e. the transition
from bit 13 to bit 14 of the midamble, as the timing reference.
NOTE 2: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a closed surface enclosing the DUT. The
EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta (θ)
and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid can be used to
speed up the measurements (See Section 5.1.2). All the EIRP samples are taken
with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 3: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 4: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements can be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 5.6.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Position the LME using the Laptop Ground Plane Phantom described in Annex
A.1.2 and according to DUT positioning described in chapter 5.1.1.
2) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see section 5.1.3) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having the characteristics described
in Annex A.
3) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 5.6.1.
4) Test steps 1 to 3 is repeated for ARFCN in the low and high range
NOTE 1: Measurement of normal burst transmitter output power. The SS takes
power measurement samples evenly distributed over the duration of one burst
with a sampling rate of at least 2/T, where T is the bit duration. The samples
are identified in time with respect to the modulation on the burst. The SS
identifies the centre of the useful 147 transmitted bits, i.e. the transition
from bit 13 to bit 14 of the midamble, as the timing reference.
NOTE 2: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE/MS to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment
with uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted
by the DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed
measurement antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 3: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.

## 5.7 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for TDD UE using LME
Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are either
missing or not yet determined:
  * The TRP Minimum Performance Requirement for this test are undefined
  * The Test Requirements and related Test Tolerances applicable for this test are undefined
### 5.7.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$

Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LME. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LME for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to

measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LME.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 8 and onward UE's
supporting LME feature.

## 5.8 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for FDD UE using LEE
Editor's note: This test case is not completed
  * Some of the Minimum Requirement numbers are missing
  * Test requirements and related TT are missing
### 5.8.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LEE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LEE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LEE.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward UE's
supporting LEE feature.

### 5.8.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
### 5.8.4 Method of test
#### 5.8.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a
bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for
more information see 3GPP TS 34.121 chapter 5.2. The period of measurement
shall be at least one timeslot. Also care should be taken that the noise floor
of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power measurement.
The LEE shall be tested according to DUT positioning described in chapter
5.1.1.
Test environment: normal; see TS34.121-1 [3] clause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see TS34.121-1 [3]
clause G.2.4.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table 5.8.2.
Set the DPCH power such that there will not be transmission gaps due to too
low signal strength throughout the measurement.
2) Power on the UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2. Compressed mode
shall be set to OFF.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode 2 and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [10] and TS 34.109 [11] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

#### 5.8.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to chapter 5.1.1
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from chapter 5.8.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Section 5.1.2). All the EIRP samples
are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 5.8.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to chapter 5.1.1
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see section 5.1.3) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having characteristics as described in
Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from section 5.8.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE/MS to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment
with uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted
by the DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed
measurement antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
### 5.8.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel in the data transfers position
shall be higher than test performance requirements for roaming bands shown in
Table 5.8.3 for notebook devices and in Table 5.8.3A for tablet devices. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results.

## 5.9 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for GSM MS using LEE
Editor's note: This test case is not completed
  * Minimum Requirements are missing
  * Test requirements and related TT are missing
### 5.9.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LEE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LEE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of LEE that support GSM for
Release 11 and later releases.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward MS's
supporting LEE feature.
### 5.9.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel of the LEE in the data transfers
position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements for roaming
bands shown in Table 5.9.1 for notebook devices and in Table 5.9.1A for tablet
devices. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRP results.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channelling the data transfers
position shall be higher than minimum performance requirements shown in the
columns "Min".

### 5.9.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$ of the MS is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
### 5.9.4 Method of test
#### 5.9.4.1 Initial conditions
A call is set up by the SS according to the generic call set up procedure on a
channel with ARFCN in the Mid ARFCN range, power control level set to Max
power. MS TXPWR_MAX_CCH is set to the maximum value supported by the Power
Class of the Mobile under test.
The SS sends Standard Test Signal C1; see TS51.010-1 [9] Annex A5.2.
The downlink power is set such that there will not be transmission gaps due to
too low signal strength throughout the measurement
The LEE shall be tested according to DUT positioning described in clause
5.1.1.
Test environment: normal condition; see TS51.010-1 [9] Annex A1.2.2.
#### 5.9.4.2 Procedure
1) Position and configure the LEE according to clause 5.1.1
2) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
3) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 5.9.1
4) Test steps 1 to 3 is repeated for ARFCN in the low and high range
NOTE 1: Measurement of normal burst transmitter output power. The SS takes
power measurement samples evenly distributed over the duration of one burst
with a sampling rate of at least 2/T, where T is the bit duration. The samples
are identified in time with respect to the modulation on the burst. The SS
identifies the centre of the useful 147 transmitted bits, i.e. the transition
from bit 13 to bit 14 of the midamble, as the timing reference.
NOTE 2: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a closed surface enclosing the DUT. The
EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta (θ)
and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid can be used to
speed up the measurements (See Section 5.1.2). All the EIRP samples are taken
with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and $\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 3: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 4: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements can be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 5.9.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Position and configure the LEE according to clause 5.1.1

in Annex A.
3) Calculate TRP using equations from section 5.9.1.
4) Test steps 1 to 3 is repeated for ARFCN in the low and high range

## 5.10 Total Radiated Power (TRP) for TDD UE using LEE
Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are either
missing or not yet determined:
  * The TRP Minimum Performance Requirement for this test are undefined
  * The Test Requirements and related Test Tolerances applicable for this test are undefined
### 5.10.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Power (TRP) is a measure of how much power the DUT actually
radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in
different directions over the entire radiation sphere:
Where $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction, $f$ is frequency.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations. $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$
and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ are the actually transmitted power-levels in
corresponding polarizations.
Thus
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 5.1.2.
The TRP can also be calculated from Rayleigh faded samples of the total power
transmitted from the LEE. The measurement of transmitter performance in an
isotropic Rayleigh fading environment is based on sampling the radiated power
of the LEE for a discrete number of field combinations in the chamber. The
average value of these statistically distributed samples is proportional to
the TRP and by calibrating the average power transfer function, an absolute
value of the TRP can be obtained. Thus
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{n}$ is the average power measured by fixed measurement antenna n and
can be calculated using the following expression:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of the complex transfer function
measured with fixed measurement antenna n and $M$ is the total number of
samples measured for each fixed measurement antenna.
Note that all averaging must be performed using linear power values (e.g.
measurements in Watts).
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LEE.
Note: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 8 and onward UE's
supporting LEE feature.
### 5.10.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel shall be higher than minimum
performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 5.10.1 for notebook
devices and in Table 5.10.1A for tablet devices. The averaging shall be done
in linear scale for the TRP results.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than
minimum performance requirements shown in the columns "Min".

The normative reference for this clause is TS37.144 [12] section 6.3.3.
### 5.10.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that $\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$of the UE is not below specified values. A lower
$\text{TRP}_{\text{average}}$ and $\text{TRP}_{\text{min}}$decrease the
coverage area.
### 5.10.4 Method of test
#### 5.10.4.1 Initial conditions
The output power is a measure of the maximum power the UE can transmit in a
bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode, for
more information see TS 34.122 [13] clause 5.2. The period of measurement
shall be at least one timeslot. Also care should be taken that the noise floor
of the measurement receiver is not disturbing the power measurement. Normally,
the receiving device should be set accordingly so that the receiving signal
will be at least 30 dB higher than the system noise floor.
The LEE shall be tested according to DUT positioning described in clause
5.1.1.
Test environment: normal; see TS 34.122 [13] clause G.2.1.
Frequencies to be tested: low range, mid range, high range; see TS 34.122 [13]
clause G.2.4.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
5.10.2. Set the DPCH power such that there will not be transmission gaps due
to too low signal strength throughout the measurement.
2) Power on the LEE UE
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode and start the loopback test.
5) The measurement receiver shall be set to: zero span, video trigger and RMS
detector. The RBW shall be at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio
access mode and the VBW at least 3 times bigger than the RBW. For 1.28Mcps TDD
UE, the RBW shall be set to 3MHz, and VBW shall be set to 10MHz.
See TS 34.108 [10] and TS 34.109 [11] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

#### 5.10.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the LEE UE.
2) As the LEE UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to clause 5.1.1
4) Measure the $\text{EIRP}_{\theta}$ and $\text{EIRP}_{\phi}$ with a sample
step of 15° in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions using a test system having
characteristics as described in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from clause 5.10.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
radiation pattern of the DUT. The power radiated by the DUT is sampled in far
field in a group of points located on a spherical surface enclosing the DUT.
The EIRP samples are taken using a constant sample step of 15° both in theta
(θ) and phi (φ) directions. In some cases a different sampling grid may be
used to speed up the measurements (See Section 5.1.2). All the EIRP samples
are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
NOTE 3: Non Standard settings: To speed up sensitivity measurements, power
measurements may be done with non standard modulation. However to obtain TRP
result the measured EIRP figures shall be normalized by
where $\text{EIRPstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with standard setting.
$\text{EIRPnstd}_{i}$ is power measurement done with non standard modulation.
$n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRP, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
#### 5.10.4.3 Procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the LEE UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to clause 5.1.1
4) Measure a sufficient number of independent samples (see section 5.1.3) of
$S_{\text{21},n,m}$ using a test system having the characteristics described
in Annex A.
5) Calculate TRP using equations from section 5.10.1.
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the total
power radiated from the UE/MS to a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment
with uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power transmitted
by the DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is sampled by the fixed
measurement antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRP value.
NOTE 2: The noise floor of the measurement receiver shall not disturb the
power measurement.
### 5.10.5 Test requirements
The average TRP of low, mid and high channel shall be higher than test
performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 5.10.3 for notebook
devices and in Table 5.10.3A for tablet devices. The averaging shall be done
in linear scale for the TRP.
In addition the minimum TRP of each measured channel shall be higher than
minimum performance requirements shown in the columns "Min".

# 6 Receiver Performance
## 6.1 General
This section describes the specifics of the radiated sensitivity measurement
procedure. There are two methods described. The main method is based on an
anechoic chamber approach and the alternative method is based on a
reverberation chamber approach.
The procedure for the measurement of the UE receiver performance is in
principle equivalent to the transmitter performance measurement described in
Annex A. The basic difference is that now the absolute sensitivity value at a
predefined BER level is the parameter of interest in each measurement point.
Note that the receiver and transmitter performances measurements may be done
in parallel, at each position.
For DUTs with more than one antenna port, all the tests should be performed
using both (all) antennas simultaneously.
### 6.1.1 DUT Positioning
The DUT positioning on head phantom means that the measurements are performed
so that the DUT is placed against a SAM phantom. The characteristics of the
SAM phantom are specified in Annex A.1.1. The DUT is attached to the SAM
phantom in "cheek" position as defined in IEEE Std 1528. The DUT performance
is measured on both left and right side of the head.
The DUT positioning on laptop ground plane phantom means that a laptop ground
plane phantom is used for radiated performance measurements in case of plug-in
DUT like USB dongles that is used away from the user's head. The DUT is
connected to the USB connector of the laptop ground plane phantom. The
characteristics of the laptop ground plane phantom and the DUT positioning are
specified in Annex A.1.2. The objective of the laptop ground plane phantom is
to reproduce the effects of the ground plane for the antenna of the DUT while
avoiding the variation of the measurements introduced by a real laptop. The
DUT shall be plugged into the USB connector and positioned in accordance with
the manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation the DUT with either the rotary USB porter or non-rotary USB
porter should be horizontally plugged into the horizontal USB connector.
The DUT positioning in free space configuration without head and hand phantoms
as specified in Annex A.4 is used for radiated performance measurements in
case of embedded module card that is used away from the user's head.
### 6.1.2 Sampling grid
A 15°-sample grid in both azimuth and elevation can be considered sufficient
for accurate measurements. Generally it can be said that since the radiating
object has a limited size the gain pattern cannot change arbitrarily versus
angle, and therefore only a limited number of samples are required to
represent the gain pattern to a given accuracy consequently. A 30°-sample grid
may be used taking also into account that there is a trade-off between the
accuracy of the approximated TRS values and the total measurement time
required to obtain a complete 3-D radiation pattern of the antenna.
Alternatively, different sampling patterns may be used, if they are able to
ensure same or greater level of accuracy. The TRS can be calculated by
interpolating the values to points on the regular grid. If an alternative
sampling pattern is used number of measurement points should be greater than
in the regular sampling grid.
### 6.1.3 Number of independent samples (for reverberation chamber procedure)
When measuring the TRS in an isotropic Rayleigh fading environment, 100
independent samples can be considered sufficient for ensuring an expanded
accuracy better than 0.5 dB.
## 6.2 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for FDD UE
### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 6.1.2.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 7 and later releases.
### 6.2.2 Minimum requirements
The average TRS of low, mid and high channel in beside head position for 1%
BER with 12.2kbps DL reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of TS25.101 [2]
shall be lower than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown
in Table 6.2.1. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRS
results of both right and left side of the phantom head.
In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be better than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown
in the columns "Max".

### 6.2.3 Test Purpose
The purpose of this test is to ensure that $\text{TRS}_{\text{Average}}$ and
$\text{TRS}_{\text{max}}$ of the UE is above specified limit. The lack of the
reception sensitivity decreases the coverage area at the far side from Node B.
### 6.2.4 Method of test
#### 6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see TS34.121-1 [3] clause G.2.1.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table 6.2.2.
2) Power on the UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2. Compressed mode
shall be set to OFF.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode 2 and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [10] and TS 34.109 [11] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

#### 6.2.4.2 Test procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE against the SAM phantom
4) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 20000 or
more bits, see Annex E.19.1.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
>
> 5) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
6) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 6.2.1
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations. The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the
measured data by equation in chapter 6.2.1.
#### 6.2.4.3 Test procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the UE against the SAM phantom
4) Set the base station simulator to a specific output power and perform a BER
measurement.
5) Increase or decrease the base station output power as needed, and repeat
step 5 until the lowest output power is found that gives a BER value of 1% ±
0.2% using 20000 or more bits, see Annex E.19.1. This corresponds to $\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
6) Repeat step 4 and 5 until a sufficient number of independent samples (see
section 6.1.3) of $\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$ has
been measured.
7) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 6.2.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on samples of the received signal
power at the UE/MS from a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power received by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is transmitted by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRS value.
### 6.2.5 Test requirements
The average TRS of low, mid and high channel in beside head position for 1%
BER with 12.2kbps DL reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of [2] shall be
lower than test requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.2.3. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRS results of both right and
left side of the phantom head.
In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be better than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown
in the columns "Max".

this test is defined and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has

## 6.3 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for GSM MS
### 6.3.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 6.1.3.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with uniform elevation and azimuth
distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on searching
for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of field
combinations in the chamber The power received by the UE at each discrete
field combination that provides a BER (or BLER) which is better than the
specified target BER/BLER level shall be averaged with other such measurements
using different field combinations. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained when the linear values
of all downlink power levels described above have been averaged. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of MS that support GSM for
Release 7 and later releases.
### 6.3.2 Minimum requirements
The average TRS of low, mid and high channel in beside head position for
TCH/FS at 2% class II (RBER) shall be lower than minimum performance
requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.3.1. The averaging shall be
done in linear scale for the TRS results of both right and left side of the
phantom head.
In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel in beside head position
shall be better than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown
in the columns "Max".

class II, by examining sequences of at least the minimum number of samples of
consecutive bits of class II. Bits are taken only from those frames not
signalled as erased.
4) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the MS causing RBERII value of 2.00% ± 0.2%, see

The Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) is a measure of the minimum power
required to achieve a specified Bit Error Rate (BER). The TRS is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 6.1.2.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the LME for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LME.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward UE's
supporting LME feature.
### 6.5.2 Minimum Requirements

reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of TS25.101 [2] shall be lower than
minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.5.1. The
averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRS results.

manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the plug-in UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using
20000 or more bits, see Annex E.19.1.
NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
freely selectable algorithm.
> 5) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
6) Calculate TRS using equations from clause 6.5.1
> NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data

> TRS result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations. The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the
measured data by equation in clause 6.5.1.
#### 6.5.4.3 Test procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the plug-in UE.
2) As the plug-in UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position the plug-in UE into the USB connector in accordance with the
manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Set the base station simulator to a specific output power and perform a BER
measurement.
5) Increase or decrease the base station output power as needed, and repeat
step 5 until the lowest output power is found that gives a BER value of 1% ±
0.2% using 20000 or more bits, see Annex E.19.1. This corresponds to $\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$.
NOTE 1: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
freely selectable algorithm.
6) Repeat step 4 and 5 until a sufficient number of independent samples (see
section 6.1.3) of $\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$ has
been measured.
7) Calculate TRS using equations from clause 6.5.1
NOTE 2: The measurement procedure is based on samples of the received signal
power at the UE/MS from a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power received by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is transmitted by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRS value.

manufacturer recommended primary mechanical mode. In the absence of such a
recommendation position the plug-in UE so that it is horizontally plugged into
the horizontal USB connector.
4) Set the base station simulator to a specific output power and perform a BER
measurement.
5) Increase or decrease the base station output power as needed, and repeat
step 5 until the lowest output power is found that gives a BER value of 1% ±
0.2% using 40000 or more bits, see Annex E.19.3. This corresponds to $\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$. The DL power step size shall be
no bigger than 0.5dB when the RF level is near the TDD UE sensitivity level.
> NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
> freely selectable algorithm.
6) Repeat step 4 and 5 until a sufficient number of independent samples (see
section 6.1.3) of $\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$ has
been measured.
7) Calculate TRS using equations from clause 6.7.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on samples of the received signal
power at the UE/MS from a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power received by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is transmitted by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRS value.
### 6.7.5 Test requirements
The average TRS of low, mid and high channel for 1% BER with 12.2kbps DL
reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of TS 34.122 [13] shall be lower
than test requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.7.3. The averaging
shall be done in linear scale for the TRS results.
In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel shall be better than
minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in the columns "Max".

## 6.8 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for FDD UE using LEE
Editor's note: This test case is not completed
  * Some of the Minimum Requirement number s are missing
  * Test requirements and related TT are missing
### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 6.1.2.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with in average uniform elevation and
azimuth distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on
searching for the lowest power received by the LEE for a discrete number of
field combinations in the chamber that gives a BER that is better than the
specified target BER level. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LEE.
NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward UE's
supporting LEE feature.
### 6.8.2 Minimum requirements

position for 1% BER with 12.2kbps DL reference channel as defined in Annex C.3
of TS25.101 [2] shall be lower than minimum performance requirements for
roaming bands shown in Table 6.8.1 for notebook devices and in Table 6.8.1A
for tablet devices. The averaging shall be done in linear scale for the TRS

In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel in the data transfers

### 6.8.3 Test Purpose
The purpose of this test is to ensure that $\text{TRS}_{\text{Average}}$ and
$\text{TRS}_{\text{max}}$ of the UE is above specified limit. The lack of the
reception sensitivity decreases the coverage area at the far side from Node B.
### 6.8.4 Method of test
#### 6.8.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see TS34.121-1 [3] clause G.2.1.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table 6.8.2.
2) Power on the UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2. Compressed mode
shall be set to OFF.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode 2 and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [10] and TS 34.109 [11] for details regarding generic call setup
procedure and loopback test.

Test dependent power
* * *
The LEE shall be tested according to DUT positioning described in chapter
6.1.1.
#### 6.8.4.2 Test procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to chapter 6.1.1
4) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 20000 or
more bits, see Annex E.19.1.
NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
freely selectable algorithm.
> 5) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
6) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 6.8.1
NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain TRS
result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations. The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the
measured data by equation in chapter 6.8.1.
#### 6.8.4.3 Test procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to chapter 6.1.14) Set the base
station simulator to a specific output power and perform a BER measurement.
5) Increase or decrease the base station output power as needed, and repeat
step 5 until the lowest output power is found that gives a BER value of 1% ±
0.2% using 20000 or more bits, see Annex E.19.1. This corresponds to $\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$.
NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
freely selectable algorithm.
6) Repeat step 4 and 5 until a sufficient number of independent samples (see
section 6.1.3) of $\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$ has
been measured.
7) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 6.8.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on samples of the received signal
power at the UE/MS from a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power received by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is transmitted by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRS value.

for 1% BER with 12.2kbps DL reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of [2]
shall be lower than test requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.8.3
for notebook devices and in Table 6.8.3A for tablet devices. The averaging
shall be done in linear scale for the TRS results.

## 6.10 Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) for TDD UE using LEE
Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are either
missing or not yet determined:
  * The TRP Minimum Performance Requirement for this test are undefined
  * The Test Requirements and related Test Tolerances applicable for this test are undefined
### 6.10.1 Definition and applicability
The Total Radiated Sensitivity (TRS) is a measure of the minimum power
required to achieve a specified Bit Error Rate (BER). The TRS is defined as:
Where the effective isotropic sensitivity (_EIS_) is defined as the power
available at the antenna output such as the sensitivity threshold is achieved
for each polarization. $\Omega$ is the solid angle describing the direction,
$f$ is frequency. $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the orthogonal polarizations.
In these formulas $N$ and $M$ are the number of sampling intervals for theta
and phi. $\theta_{n}$ and $\phi_{m}$ are the measurement angles. The sampling
intervals are discussed further in Section 6.1.2.
The TRS can also be calculated from measurements in a Rayleigh fading 3
dimensional isotropic environment with uniform elevation and azimuth
distribution. The calculation of the TRS is in this case based on searching
for the lowest power received by the UE/MS for a discrete number of field
combinations in the chamber The power received by the UE at each discrete
field combination that provides a BER which is better than the specified
target BER level shall be averaged with other such measurements using
different field combinations. By calibrating the average power transfer
function, an absolute value of the TRS can be obtained when the linear values
of all downlink power levels described above have been averaged. The following
expression can be used to find the TRS.
where $P_{\text{ref},n}$ is the reference power transfer function for fixed
measurement antenna n, $R_{n}$ is the reflection coefficient for fixed
measurement antenna n and $C_{n}$ is the path loss in the cables connecting
the measurement receiver to fixed measurement antenna n. These parameters are
calculated from the calibration measurement and are further discussed in Annex
B.2. $P_{\text{thres},n}$ is calculated by using the following equation:
where $S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}}$ is the m:th value of the transfer
function for fixed measurement antenna n, which gives the BER threshold. $M$
is the total number of values of the BER threshold power measured for each
fixed measurement antenna.
The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the TDD UE for
Release 11 and later releases that support LEE.
Note: This test case can be optionally executed for Release 7 and onward UE's
supporting LEE feature.
### 6.10.2 Minimum Requirements
The average TRS of low, mid and high channel for 1% BER with 12.2kbps DL
reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of TS 34.122 [13] shall be lower
than minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.10.1
for notebook devices and Table 6.10.1A for tablet devices. The averaging shall
be done in linear scale for the TRS results.
In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel shall be better than
minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in the columns "Min".

The normative reference for this clause is TS37.144 [12] section 7.3.3.
### 6.10.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to ensure that $\text{TRS}_{\text{average}}$ and
$\text{TRS}_{\text{max}}$ of the UE is above specified limit. The lack of the
reception sensitivity decreases the coverage area at the far side from Node B.
### 6.10.4 Method of test
#### 6.10.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see TS34.122 [13] clause G.2.1.
1) Set the SS downlink physical channels according to settings in Table
6.10.2. The DL power level should be set to ensure 0% BER at 12.2kbps data
rate at the whole 3D initial scan.
2) Power on the LEE UE.
3) A call is set up according to the Generic call setup procedure. The power
control algorithm shall be set to Power Control Algorithm 2.
4) Enter the UE into loopback test mode and start the loopback test.
See TS 34.108 [10] and TS 34.109 [11] and Annex C of TS 34.122[13]. For
details regarding generic call setup procedure and loopback test.

* * *
#### 6.10.4.2 Procedure
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the LEE UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to clause 5.1.1
4) Measure EIS from one measurement point. EIS is the power transmitted from
one specific direction to the UE causing BER value of 1% ± 0.2% using 40000 or
more bits, see Annex E.19.3. The DL power step size shall be no bigger than
0.5dB when the RF level is near the TDD UE sensitivity level.
NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
freely selectable algorithm.
> 5) Measure the EIS for every direction of selected sampling gird using two
> orthogonal polarizations to obtain TRS.
6) Calculate TRS using equations from clause 6.7.1
> NOTE: To speed up sensitivity measurements non standard setting (i.e. data
> speed, PCL, BER target) can be used in the measurements. However to obtain
> TRS result the measured EIS figures shall be normalized by
Where $\text{EISstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with standard
setting. $\text{EISnstd}_{i}$ is sensitivity measurement done with non
standard settings. $n$ is amount of reference measurement points.
To ensure accuracy of TRS, the amount of reference points measured should be
at least 4. It is recommended to spread the reference measurements equally
during the measurement time.
The measurement procedure is based on the measurement of the spherical
sensitivity pattern of the DUT. The sensitivity values of the DUT at a
predefined BER level are sampled in far field in a group of points located on
a spherical surface enclosing the DUT. The EIS samples are taken using a
constant sample step of 30° both in theta (θ) and phi (φ) directions. All the
EIS samples are taken with two orthogonal polarizations, $\theta$- and
$\phi$-polarisations. The Total Radiated Sensitivity is calculated from the
measured data by equation in clause 6.10.1.
#### 6.10.4.3 Test procedure, reverberation chamber method
1) Send continuously Up power control commands to the LEE UE.
2) As the UE reaches maximum power, start sending PN15 data pattern.
3) Position and configure the LEE according to clause 5.1.1
4) Set the base station simulator to a specific output power and perform a BER
measurement.
5) Increase or decrease the base station output power as needed, and repeat
step 5 until the lowest output power is found that gives a BER value of 1% ±
0.2% using 40000 or more bits, see Annex E.19.3. This corresponds to $\left|
S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$. The DL power step size shall be
no bigger than 0.5dB when the RF level is near the TDD UE sensitivity level.
NOTE: To meet BER value target DL power level can be changed using user's
freely selectable algorithm.
6) Repeat step 4 and 5 until a sufficient number of independent samples (see
section 6.1.3) of $\left| S_{\text{21},n,m}^{\text{thres}} \right|^{2}$ has
been measured.
7) Calculate TRS using equations from chapter 6.10.1
NOTE 1: The measurement procedure is based on samples of the received signal
power at the UE/MS from a full 3 dimensional isotropic environment with
uniform elevation and azimuth field distribution. The power received by the
DUT is undergoing Rayleigh fading and is transmitted by the fixed measurement
antennas. Moreover, it is important that the samples collected are
independent, in order to get sufficient accuracy of the estimated TRS value.
### 6.10.5 Test requirements
The average TRS of low, mid and high channel for 1% BER with 12.2kbps DL
reference channel as defined in Annex C.3 of TS 34.122 [13] shall be lower
than test requirements for roaming bands shown in Table 6.10.3 for notebook
devices and Table 6.10.3A for tablet devices. The averaging shall be done in
linear scale for the TRS results.
In addition the maximum TRS of each measured channel shall be better than
minimum performance requirements for roaming bands shown in the columns "Max".

Example of recipe for tissue simulating liquid is presented in annex F.
## A.1.2 Laptop Ground Plane Phantom
A laptop ground plane phantom is used for radiated performance measurements in
case of plug-in DUT like USB dongles. The laptop ground plane phantom
specified in figure A.A1 is composed of the following parts:
A rectangular plane covered by a conductive film on the upper side with
thickness of 4 mm to emulate the keyboard and main body of the laptop;
A rectangular plane covered by the same conductive film on the upper side with
thickness of 4mm to emulate the screen of the laptop;
The conductive film on the two planes is connected. The angle between the two
planes is 110 degrees. The material is FR-4 copper-clad sheet and the length
and width of these two planes are 345 mm and 238 mm respectively;
A horizontal USB connector is placed along the short end of the plane. The
location of the port is at the right back corner, the distance between the
central axis of the USB connector and the rear edge of plane is 45 mm, and the
ground of the USB connector is welded on the conductive film of the plane. The
detailed description of the structure is specified in figure A.A2;
A USB cable crossing the ground plane and connecting the USB connector to a
real functional laptop. The USB cable should be equipped with a shielded metal
film, and the portion of the cable that is hanged in the air shall be covered
with absorbing material or treated with quarter wave chokes. The part of the
USB cable lying on the plane is covered by a conductive adhesive strip used
for fixing the cable on the plane and for guarantying at the same time the
superficial continuity of the conductive plane. The shielded conductive film
of this part of the USB cable is connected to the conductive film of the plane
and the covered strip to well ground the antenna. The length of the USB cable
should be no more than 3m.

laptop

# A.2 Anechoic chamber constraints
Testing shall be performed in an anechoic chamber fulfilling following
requirements.
## A.2.1 Positioner
For the DUT positioning on head phantom the chamber should be equipped with a
positioner making possible to perform full 3-D measurements for both Tx and Rx
radiated performance. The centre of the rotation should be the phase centre of
the antenna, in the case it is not possible to evaluate an estimation of the
antenna centre should be used. Alternatively centre of the line between right
and left ear reference points can be used as a centre of rotation. Theta (θ)
and phi (φ) angles are specified in figure A.1.

For the DUT positioning on laptop ground plane phantom the chamber should be
equipped with a positioner making possible to perform full 3-D measurements
for both Tx and Rx radiated performance. The real functional laptop is laid on
the floor of the anechoic chamber, supplies power to the DUT and controls the
state of the DUT. Both the USB cable and the real functional laptop are
properly setup in order to have a negligible impact on the measurements: the
real functional laptop is fully wrapped up with anechoic absorbers. Theta (θ)
and phi (φ) angles are specified in figure A.1A.

Figure A.1A: The coordinate system used in the measurements for the laptop
ground plane phantom
## A.2.2 Measurement Antenna
The measurement antenna should be able to measure two orthogonal polarizations
(typically linear theta (θ) and phi (φ) polarizations). Note that single-
polarized linear measurement antenna can also be used by turning it 90 ° for
every measurement point.
For far-field measurements, the distance _r_ between the DUT and the
measurement antenna should be
where λ is the wavelength of the measurement frequency and _D_ the maximum
extension of the radiating structure. Then the phase- and amplitude
uncertainty limits and the reactive near field limit are not exceeded. The
influence of measurement distance is discussed in Appendix A - Estimation of
Measurement Uncertainty
## A.2.3 Quiet Zone
**Reflectivity of the quiet zone shall be measured for frequencies used with
method described in Appendix F. Measured reflectivity level is used in
uncertainty calculations.**
## A.2.4 Shielding effectiveness of the chamber
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz. See Appendix G for more details on shielding effectiveness
validation.
# A.3 Reverberation chamber constraints
The alternative test method can be realized in a reverberation chamber
fulfilling the following requirements.
## A.3.1 Positioning and mode stirring facilities
The reverberation chamber shall be equipped with mode-stirring facilities in
such a way that enough number of independent power samples can be achieved for
the accuracy requirement stated in this standard to be fulfilled. Possible
mode-stirring methods include platform stirring, polarization stirring and
mechanical stirring with fan-type stirrers, irregular shaped rotational
stirrers, or plate-type stirrers. Also frequency stirring is possible if the
type of measurement allows for a frequency-averaged value, but this is not
necessary if the chamber is sufficiently large and well stirred.
For the DUT positioning on head phantom or for the DUT positioning on laptop
ground plane phantom, the DUT should be placed in such a way that a sufficient
number of independent samples are obtained to fulfil the uncertainty
requirements. For example, for chambers utilizing platform stirring the DUT
should be placed on the edge of the turntable in order to maximize rotation of
the DUT. In addition, the DUT must not be closer than 0.5 wavelengths to other
electromagnetic reflective objects inside the chamber and 0.7 wavelengths to
absorbing objects.
For the DUT positioning on laptop ground plane phantom the real functional
laptop is laid on the floor of the chamber, supplies power to the DUT and
controls the state of the DUT. Both the USB cable and the real functional
laptop are properly setup in order to have a negligible impact on the
measurements: the real functional laptop is fully wrapped up with anechoic
absorbers. The real functional laptop can be placed outside the chamber if the
connection to the DUT can be maintained and if the communication interface
between DUT and real functional laptop has negligible impact on the
measurements.
A schematic picture of the measurement setup is provided in Figure A.2.
{width="6.534027777777778in" height="2.7847222222222223in"}
Figure A.2: A schematic picture of the reverberation chamber measurement
setup.
## A.3.2 Measurement Antennas
It is important that the measurement antennas are configured in such a way
that the statistical distribution of waves in the chamber in average
corresponds to an isotropic environment.
## A.3.3 Chamber size and characteristics
The reverberation chamber shall have a volume large enough to support the
number of modes needed for the stated accuracy at the lowest operating
frequency. If the UE/MS is moved around in the chamber during the measurement,
the volume of the reverberation chamber can be reduced. Also, frequency
stirring can be used to improve the accuracy, however, this will reduce the
resolution of the results correspondingly.
The reverberation chamber can be loaded with lossy objects in order to control
the power delay profile in the chamber to some extent. However the
reverberation chamber should not be loaded to such an extent that the mode
statistics in the chamber are destroyed. It is important to keep the same
amount of lossy objects in the chamber during calibration measurement and test
measurement, in order not to change the average power transfer function
between these two cases. Examples of lossy object are head and hand phantoms.
Furthermore, the DUT must not be closer than 0.5 wavelengths to other
electromagnetic reflective objects inside the chamber and 0.7 wavelengths to
absorbing objects.
## A.3.4 Shielding effectiveness of the chamber
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz. See Appendix G.A for more details on shielding effectiveness
validation.
# A.4 Embedded Devices
The main objectives of this section are to define basic parameters required
when performing TRP and TRS measurements on Notebook and Tablets.
## A.4.1 Notebook
A notebook PC is a portable personal computer combining the computer, keyboard
and display in one form factor. Typically the keyboard is built into the base
and the display is hinged along the back edge of the base. The largest single
dimension for a notebook is limited to 0.42 m.
As notebooks are not body worn equipment nor recommended for use placed
directly on the lap, the notebook shall be tested in a free space
configuration without head and hand phantoms.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Calibration
The relative power values of the measurement points will be transformed to
absolute radiated power values (in dBm) by performing a calibration
measurement. The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna
with known efficiency or gain values. In the calibration measurement the
reference antenna is measured in the same place as the DUT, and the
attenuation of the complete transmission path ($L_{\text{total}}$) from the
DUT to the measurement receiver/NB/BS simulator is calibrated out. For the
reverberation chamber method, the calibration antenna can be placed in an
arbitrarily position in the chamber, as long as it is placed 0.5 wavelengths
from other metallic objects and 0.7 wavelengths from absorbing objects.
The gain and/or radiation efficiency of the reference antenna shall be known
at the frequency bands in which the calibrations are performed. Recommended
calibration antennas are monopole antennas or sleeve dipoles tuned for the
each frequency band of interest. Alternatively, other methods may be used if
they ensure an equal or greater level of accuracy. A network analyzer is
recommended to be used to perform the calibration measurement. Also other
devices can be used to measure attenuation. The calibration is performed
individually for the both orthogonal polarizations, all the transmission paths
and all frequencies used in the testing. For the reverberation chamber method,
all polarizations and transmission paths are included in one calibration
measurement.
The principle is based on the use of calibration/substitution antennas
presenting an efficiency known with a sufficient accuracy in the measurement
bandwidths. Such a calibration antenna is placed on the DUT positioner at the
exact MS location used for TRP and TRS measurement. It is possible to use a
mechanical piece to place the calibration antenna on the positioner. This
mechanical piece should not present any electromagnetic properties, which
could influence the frequency response and the radiation properties of the
calibration antenna. Find hereafter, an illustration of the substitution
configuration in Figure B.1.
For the reverberation chamber method the calibration antenna can be place in
an arbitrarily position, as long as it is placed 0.5 wavelengths from other
metallic objects and 0.7 wavelengths from absorbing objects. An illustration
of the measurement setup for this procedure can be found in Figure B.2.
# B.1 Calibration Procedure
$L_{\text{total}}$ is the attenuation between P and B, see figure B.1.
Where $L_{\text{AC}}$ is cable loss from A to C. The cable AC connecting the
substitution antenna should be such that its influence upon radiation pattern
measurements is minimal. $L_{\text{AB}}$ is the attenuation between points A
and B. In TRP and TRS measurements point B is connected to the calibrated
input/output port of measurement receiver.
$E_{\text{cal}}$ is the efficiency or gain of the calibration antenna at the
frequency of interest.
{width="6.510416666666667in" height="3.0833333333333335in"}
Figure B.1 Calibration/substitution procedures using a vector network
analyzer.
If the calibration is based on known efficiency of the calibration antenna, a
full spherical scanning is performed to determine$L_{\text{AB}}$. Unless the
otherwise specified in the calibration antenna documentation, TRP sampling
grid and equation for TRP in section 5.2.1 should be used for head phantom and
TRP sampling grid and equation for TRP in section 5.5.1 should be used for
laptop ground plane phantom and embedded devices.
This procedure has to be done at each frequency of interest.
To achieve measurements with an uncertainty as low as possible, it is
absolutely necessary to exactly keep the same P to B configuration (cables,
dual-polarized antenna.
# B.2 Calibration Procedure -- Reverberation Chamber Method
The purpose of the calibration measurement is to determine the average power
transfer function in the chamber, mismatch of fixed measurement antennas and
path losses in cables connecting the power sampling instrument and the fixed
measurement antennas. Preferably a network analyzer is used for these
measurements. Recommended calibration antennas are dipoles tuned to the
frequency band of interest.
In general, the calibration of a reverberation chamber is performed in three
steps:
1\. Measurement of S-parameters through the reverberation chamber for a
complete stirring sequence
2\. Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
3\. Measurement of connecting cable insertion loss
If several setups are used (e.g. empty chamber, chamber with head phantom,

vector network analyzer.
## B.2.1 Measurement of S-parameters through the chamber for a complete
stirring sequence
This step will measure S-parameters through the reverberation chamber through
a complete stirring sequence. This information is required to determine the
chamber's reference transfer function. The procedure must be performed
separately for each measurement setup of which the loading of the chamber has
been changed. The calibration procedure must be repeated for each frequency as
defined above. Therefore, it is advantageous if the network analyzer can be
set to a frequency sweep covering the defined frequencies, so that all
frequencies of interest can be measured with a minimal number of measurement
runs.
i. Place all objects into the RC which will be used during TRP or TRS
measurements, including a head phantom, hand phantom and fixture for the EUT.
This ensures that the loss in the chamber, which determines the average power
transfer level, is the same during both calibration and test measurements.
Also, if the EUT is large or contains many antennas, it may represent a
noticeable loading of the chamber. It should then be present in the chamber
and turned on during the calibration.
ii. Place the calibration antenna inside the chamber. The calibration antenna
is preferably mounted on a low-loss dielectric fixture, to avoid effects from
the fixture itself which may affect the EUT's radiation efficiency and
mismatch factor. The calibration antenna must be placed in the chamber in such
a way that it is far enough from any walls, mode-stirrers, head phantom, or
other object, such that the environment for the calibration antenna (taken
over the complete stirring sequence) resembles a free space environment** _.
"Far enough away" depends on the type of calibration antenna used. For low
gain nearly omnidirectional antennas like dipoles, it is normally sufficient
to ensure that this spacing is larger than 0.5 wavelengths. More directive
calibration antennas should be situated towards the centre of the chamber. The
calibration antenna should be present in the chamber during the TRP/TRS
measurements._**
iii. Calibrate the network analyzer with a full 2-port calibration in such a
way that the vector S-parameters between the ports of the fixed measurement
antenna and the calibration antenna can be accurately measured. Preferably,
the network analyzer is set to perform a frequency sweep at each stirrer
position. This will enable calibration of several frequency points during the
same stirring sequence, thereby reducing calibration time. This will also
enable frequency stirring, i.e., averaging the measured power transfer
function over a small frequency bandwidth around each measured frequency point
(moving frequency window). This will increase accuracy at the expense of
frequency resolution.
iv. Connect the antennas and measure the S-parameters for each stirrer
position and each fixed measurement antenna.
The number of stirrer positions in the chosen stirring sequence, i.e. the
number of S-parameter samples at each frequency point, should be chosen in
such a way that it is large enough to yield an acceptable statistical
contribution to the total measurement uncertainty. As a guideline it should be
larger than 100, preferable 200 or 400 to ensure that the number of
independent samples is not severely limited by the total number of samples
measured. The number of independent samples, which is a subset of all samples,
determines the statistical contribution to the expanded accuracy (which is two
times the standard deviation). This should be not less than 100 to ensure an
expanded accuracy better than 0.5 dB. The number of independent samples
depends on the operating frequency, volume of the chamber, efficacy of the
chamber's stirrers, the level of loading by absorbing objects, and whether or
not frequency stirring is used.
The sequence of moving the stirrers to different positions may be either step-
wise (stopping stirrer for each sample) or continuous (sampling on-the-fly).
With continuous stirring it may not be possible to characterize the chamber
over a wide frequency band at the same time.
B.2.2 Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
From the S-parameters obtained in the calibration measurement, the chamber
reference transfer function for fixed antenna _n_ can be calculated. The
reflection coefficient for fixed antenna _n_ can be calculated as
Thus, the chamber reference transfer function can be calculated as
where _M_ is the total number of samples of the transfer function measured for
each fixed measurement antenna and $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of
the transfer function for measurement antenna n. Moreover,
$\overline{S_{\text{22}}}$ is the complex average of the calibration antenna
reflection coefficient. Finally, $e_{\text{ref}}$ is the radiation efficiency
of the calibration antenna.
Note that the radiation efficiency of the fixed antenna is not corrected for,
because it will be the same both during calibration and measurements.
Therefore the fixed antenna's radiation efficiency will not affect the final
results. The same can be said about the mismatch factor of the fixed
measurement antennas, but it is still advantageous to correct for this factor
if frequency stirring is applied to improve accuracy.

## B.2.3 Cable calibration
This measurement step will calibrate the power loss of the cable needed to
connect the instrument used to measure the received power at the fixed
measurement antenna during TRP measurements, and to generate the power
radiated by the fixed antenna during TRS measurements.
i. Disconnect the cables between the VNA and the chamber.
ii. Connect the cables one-by-one between the two ports of the network
analyzer. The VNA must be calibrated at its own two ports.
iii. Measure the frequency response of the transmission S-parameter ( or ) of
the cable.
iv. Save the power transfer values () of the frequency response curve for the
test frequencies. and cables positions, etc).
Calibration shall be performed yearly or if any equipment in the measurement
system is changed.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Estimation of Measurement Uncertainty
Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet determined:
  * The head and hand phantom and hand only phantom configurations are TBD
Individual uncertainty contributions in the TRP and TRS measurements are
discussed and evaluated in this Appendix. A technique for calculating the
total measurement uncertainty is also presented. More detailed discussion on
the uncertainty contributions can be found from [4].
The TRP/TRS measurement procedure can be considered to include two stages. In
Stage 1 the actual measurement of the 3-D pattern of the Device Under Test
(DUT) is performed. In Stage 2 the calibration of the absolute level of the
DUT measurement results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna
whose absolute gain/radiation efficiency is known at the frequencies of
interest. The uncertainty contributions related to TRP are listed in Table E.1
and the contributions related to TRS are in Table A.2. The uncertainty
contributions are analyzed in the following paragraphs.
The calculation of the uncertainty contribution is based on the ISO Guide to
the expression of uncertainty in measurement. Each individual uncertainty is
expressed by its Standard Deviation (termed here as 'standard uncertainty')
and represented by symbol U. The uncertainty contributions can be classified
to two categories: Type-A uncertainties, which are statistically determined
e.g. by repeated measurements, and Type-B uncertainties, which are derived
from existing data e.g. data sheets. Several individual uncertainties are
common in Stage 1 and Stage 2 and therefore cancel.
The procedure of forming the uncertainty budget in TRP measurement is:
1) Compile lists of individual uncertainty contributions for TRP measurement
both in Stage 1 and Stage 2.
2) Determine the standard uncertainty of each contribution by
a) Determining the distribution of the uncertainty (Gaussian, U-shaped,
rectangular, etc.)
b) Determining the maximum value of each uncertainty (unless the distributions
is Gaussian)
c) Calculating the standard uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by
{width="0.2638888888888889in" height="0.2361111111111111in"} if the
distribution is U-shaped, and by {width="0.25in" height="0.25in"} if the
distribution is rectangular.
3) Convert the units into decibel, if necessary.
4) Combine all the standard uncertainties by the Root of the Sum of the
Squares (RSS) method.
5) Combine the total uncertainties in Stage 1 and Stage 2 also by the RSS
method: {width="2.5833333333333335in" height="0.2916666666666667in"}.
6) Multiply the result by an expansion factor of 1.96 to derive expanded
uncertainty at 95% confidence level: 1.96 * {width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}.
Example uncertainty budgets are presented in Tables E.5, E.6, E.7, E.8, E.9,
E.10, E.11, E.12, E.13 and E. 14.

# E.1 Mismatch uncertainty between measurement receiver and the probe antenna
If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the probe
antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken into
account and should be measured or determined by the method described in [1].
# E.2 FFS
# E.3 Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna cable does not move between the calibration and the DUT
measurement stage, the uncertainty due to the insertion loss of the cable is
assumed to be systematic. Moreover, this uncertainty is common and constant in
both stages and that is why this leads to 0.00dB value.
If a different cable is used in the calibration measurement and in the DUT
measurement, and the difference of the insertion loss is used in the
calculations, then the overall combined standard uncertainty of the insertion
loss measurement should be used in the uncertainty budget. The distribution of
this uncertainty is assumed to be rectangular, in which case the standard
uncertainty can be calculated as the maximum value/√3.
# E.4 Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used)
See Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna attenuator is used in both stages, the uncertainty is
considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
# E.5 Insertion loss of the RF relays (if used)
See Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.
If the RF relay is used in both stages, the uncertainty is considered
systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
# E.6 Influence of the antenna cable
## E.6.1 Probe antenna cable
If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain >+5dBi e.g. horn, LPDA,
etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for both stages,
the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant  0.00dB value.
In other cases a technical study should be done.
An ETSI technical report [4] gives a discussion on the results obtained by
testing a vertically polarized biconical antenna over a ground plane with
differing RF cable configurations.
## E.6.2 Calibration antenna cable
If an efficiency calibration is performed, influence of the calibration
antenna feed cable can be assumed to be negligible, due to data averaging.
In the case of gain calibration, the influence of the calibration antenna feed
cable shall be assessed by measurements. A gain calibration measurement is
repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable. Largest
difference between the results is entered to the uncertainty budget with a
rectangular distribution.
# E.7 Absolute gain of the probe antenna
The uncertainty appears in the both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00dB value.
# E.8 Measurement Receiver: uncertainty of absolute level
The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in TRP tests
either as an absolute level or as a relative level. Receiving device used is
typically a Base Station Simulator (BSS), spectrum analyzer (SA), or power
meter (PM). Generally there occurs an uncertainty contribution from limited
absolute level accuracy and non-linearity.
# E.9 Measurement distance
The uncertainty contribution from a finite measurement distance is estimated
in three parts.
## E.9.1 Offset of DUT phase centre from axis(es) of rotation
In all the measurements defined in this test procedure the DUT and phantom
combination is rotated about the ear reference point of SAM phantom, which is
also assumed to be the location of the phase centre in both angular directions
of the measurements.
For some turntables this may be practically impossible in which case a
measurement uncertainty contribution can arise because the phase centre will
rotate on a non-zero radius about the centre of rotation, thereby giving a
variable measurement distance. Data averaging process may lead to a partial
self-cancel of this uncertainty.
The following formula is used to estimate this uncertainty contribution in
stage 1:
U~phase_center_limits~ (dB) = $\text{10}\text{log}(d \pm \text{Δd})^{2} +
\text{10}\text{log}(d)^{2}$
If a gain calibration is performed in Stage 2, the uncertainty contribution of
calibration antenna's displacement is estimated with the previous formula.
Misalignment can be estimated with following formula,
U~misaligment~ (dB) = $\text{20}\text{log}\left( \text{cos}\theta \right)$,
where$\theta$ is the misalignment angle between the calibration antenna and
the probe antenna. The contribution shall be added to displacement error:
U~cal~ (dB) = $\sqrt{U_{\text{phase}_{\text{center}_{\Delta}}}^{2} +
U_{\text{misaligment}}^{2}}$
For an efficiency calibration with an omnidirectional calibration antenna, the
U~cal~ is calculated similarly as for gain calibration but the uncertainty may
be divided by factor 2. This is due to correcting impact of data averaging in
this type of calibration.
## E.9.2 Mutual coupling
In measurement of radio performances of UMTS mobile phones in speech mode, the
mutual coupling uncertainty for this frequency band is a 0.00dB value (see
annex A-2 in [5]).
The 0.00dB value can be extended for the GSM; DCS and PCS band frequencies.
## E.9.3 Phase curvature
This uncertainty originates from the finite far-field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the DUT. If the measurement distance is >
10λ, this error is assumed to be negligible. At 2 GHz λ is 0.15 m, thus 10λ is
1.5 m.
# E.10 Quality of quiet zone
The uncertainty contribution of the reflectivity level of the anechoic chamber
is determined from the average standard deviation of the electric field in the
quiet zone. By repeating a free space VSWR measurement in 15-degree grid in
elevation and azimuth, 264 standard deviation values in both polarizations are
determined. From these values average standard deviation of electric field in
the quiet zone can be calculated from the equation:
where
$N$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$M$is number of angular intervals in azimuth and
$\theta_{n}$ is elevation of single measurement$s_{n,m,\text{pol}}$.
If an efficiency calibration with omnidirectional calibration antenna is
performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 2 and
$\overline{S_{\text{freq}}}$may be divided by factor 2. This is due to
correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration. Efficiency
calibration done with sampling step ≤ 30°, can be considered to have at least
four independent samples. $\overline{S_{\text{freq}}}$may be divided by factor
2 also in stage 1 for the same reason.
It's likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small impact on
this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper bound to probe
symmetry should be considered.
# E.11 Tx-power drift of DUT
A single point power reference measurement in the beginning and at the end of
the measurement procedure is recommended to monitor the power drift of the
DUT. Based on TX-power drift measurements for typical 3G UE the determination
of this contribution is performed by measuring the Tx-power drift and the
value shall be included in the uncertainty budget.
In order to minimize Tx-power drift error it's recommended to interleave
sensitivity and power measurement of multiple channels. This spreads the
measurements over a longer period, which helps to average the drift of the TX-
power.
# E.12 Uncertainty related to the use of phantom
## E.12.1 Uncertainty from using different types of SAM phantom
This uncertainty contribution originates from the fact that different
laboratories may use the two different versions of SAM head: the SAM head
phantom or the SAM phantom including the head and the shoulders. The standard
SAM head is the specified phantom. However, the use of the other type of SAM
is also allowed with the requirement that the resulting uncertainty
contribution is taken into account in the uncertainty budget.
## E.12.2 Simulated tissue liquid uncertainty
This uncertainty will occur, if the laboratory uses a liquid which has
dielectric parameters deviating from the target parameters given in chapter
Annex A. The relative dielectric constant (ε~r~) and conductivity (σ) of used
material shall be maintained within ±25% of target properties listed in Annex
A. To convert electrical parameters of the tissue stimulant ε~r~ and σ to
uncertainty values following equation shall be used:
## E.12.3 Device Holder
This uncertainty contribution originates from interaction of the Device Holder
(the supporting structure of low-loss dielectric material that is used to hold
the handset under-test in the desired position during measurement, as defined
in the IEEE 1528) and the DUT. The Device Holder Uncertainty contribution
depends on the different laboratories implementation and on the shape and
manufacturing material. The Device Holder has an influence that varies with
the relative position with respect to the DUT Antenna. Due to this the Device
Holder should be designed to have maximum distance between Device Holder and
DUT Antenna. The fixed value 0.2 dB is used to estimate the impact of device
holder in uncertainty calculation. The determination of this contribution is
performed by measuring the TRP and TRS with and without the holder.
## E.12.4 Uncertainty of dielectric properties and shape of the hand phantom
TBD
## E.12.5 Uncertainty from using different types of Laptop Ground Plane
phantom
This uncertainty contribution originates from the fact that different
laboratories may use different variations of Laptop Ground Plane phantom.
Based on Section 5.1.3, the standard Laptop Ground Plane is the specified
phantom.
# E.13 Coarse sampling grid
Degreasing of sampling density to finite amount of samples affects the
measurement uncertainty by two different errors. First is due to inadequate
number of samples and second is a systematic discrimination approximation
error in TRP and TRS equations.
The offset of systematic approximation error can be expressed by using formula
$\text{Offset} = \text{10} \cdot \text{log}\text{10}\left(
\frac{\pi}{2N}\sum_{n - 1}^{N}{\text{sin}\left( \theta_{n} \right)} \right)$.
where
$N$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$\theta_{n}$ is elevation.
{width="5.502083333333333in" height="3.3680555555555554in"}
Figure E.7. Approximation error of TRP/TRS.
The 10° or 15° sampling grid used in TRP measurements has been shown to
introduce only very small differences as compared to the results obtained with
denser grids, so with that sampling grid the uncertainty contribution can
assumed negligible.
When using sample step size of 15° - 30°, standard uncertainty of 0.15dB can
be assumed to cover errors.
# E.14 Random uncertainty
The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous effects
which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of uncertainty with a
repeatability test by making a series of repeated measurement with a reference
DUT without changing anything in the measurement set-up.
The random uncertainty differs from one laboratory to another. Moreover, each
DUT has its own electromagnetic behaviour and random uncertainty. Some
uncertainty also occurs from the positioning of the DUT against the SAM
phantom, as the DUT cannot be attached exactly in the same way every time.
This uncertainty depends on how much the DUT\'s positioning against the SAM
phantom varies from the specified testing positions. It is noted that the
uncertainty of the phone positioning depends on the phone holder and the
measurement operator and is in fact difficult to distinguish from random
uncertainty. Some uncertainty also occurs from the positioning of the DUT
plugged into the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, as the DUT may not be plugged
into the USB connector and positioned exactly in the same way every time. This
uncertainty depends on how much the DUT\'s position plugged into the Laptop
Ground Plane phantom varies from the specified plug-in position. Therefore,
the positioning uncertainty is included in random uncertainty.
To estimate this uncertainty for the SAM phantom, it is suggested to perform
at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS whereby the device shall be dismounted
and newly positioned with a fully charged battery before each tests. This
measurement set has to be carried out in mid channel of lowest and highest
frequency bands utilized by the testing lab, for at least three phones with
different type of mechanical design. The values have to be normalized by the
mean for each measurement set. As a result the uncertainty contribution
entered to uncertainty budget is the difference between the maximum and
minimum normalized value.
To estimate this uncertainty for the Laptop Ground Plane phantom, it is
suggested to perform at least five evaluations of TRP/TRS for the plug-in
position whereby the device shall be dismounted and newly positioned before
each tests. This measurement set has to be carried out in mid channel of
lowest and highest frequency bands utilized by the testing lab, for at least
three USBs with different type of mechanical design. The values have to be
normalized by the mean for each measurement set. As a result the uncertainty
contribution entered to uncertainty budget is the difference between the
maximum and minimum normalized value.
# E.15 Uncertainty of network analyzer
This uncertainty includes the all uncertainties involved in the S21
measurement with a network analyzer, and will be calculated from the
manufacturer's data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise
informed, (see clause 5.1.2 in [6]).
# E.16 Uncertainty of the gain/efficiency of the calibration antenna
The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the
gain/efficiency uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer's data in logs with
a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed (see clause 5.1.2 in
[6]).
If the manufacturer's data do not give the information, the value has to be
checked, see annex A-12 in [5]
# E.17 Base station simulator: uncertainty of the absolute level
The transmitter device (typically a BS Simulator) is used to drive a signal to
the horn antenna in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a
relative level. Receiving device used is typically a UE/MS. Generally there
occurs uncertainty contribution from limited absolute level accuracy and non-
linearity of the BS Simulator.
For practical reasons, the calibration measurement (Stage 2) should be only
performed with the probe antenna as a receiver. Hence, the uncertainty on the
absolute level of the transmitter device cannot be assumed as systematic. This
uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer's data in logs with a
rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed (see clause 5.1.2 in [6]).
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity of the device is included in
the absolute level uncertainty.
# E.18 BER measurement: output level step resolution
When output power of the BS simulator is swept to reach the BER target, used
power step resolution creates this uncertainty. Output power step used in the
BER measurement is divided by factor 2 to obtain the uncertainty with
rectangular distribution.
# E.19 Statistical uncertainty of the BER measurement
To study statistical uncertainty of BER measurement, see ETSI document TR 100
028-1, section 6.6 [4].
For a full TRS measurement with a regular sampling grid, the statistical
uncertainty can be approximated by using the following formula:
$U_{\text{fullTRS}} = \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRS}}}{\sqrt{N/4}}$,
Where
$U_{\text{SingleTRS}}$ is the statistical uncertainty of single measurement,
$N$ is the number of measurements.
## E.19.1 WCDMA
For a BER target of 1%±0.2% using 20000 bits, uncertainty of 0.19 dB for a
single measurement can be used. Using a BER target of 10%±2% with 20000 tested
bits will lead to uncertainty of 0.46dB for a single measurement. If non
standard settings are used to determine EIS the statistical error of the
measurement should be estimated according to ETSI document TR 100 028-1.
## E.19.2 GSM
For a BER target of 2.00%±0.2% using 10000 bits, uncertainty of 0.13 dB for a
single measurement can be used. If non standard settings are used to determine
EIS the statistical error of the measurement should be estimated according to
ETSI document TR 100 028-1.
For a BLER target of 10%±2% with 20000 tested bits will lead to uncertainty of
0.46dB for a single measurement. If non standard settings are used to
determine EIS the statistical error of the measurement should be estimated
according to ETSI document TR 100 028-1.
## E.19.3 TD-SCDMA
For a BER target of 1% ± 0.2% using 40000 bits, uncertainty of 0.13 dB for a
single measurement can be used. If non standard settings are used to determine
EIS the statistical error of the measurement should be estimated according to
ETSI document TR 100 028-1.
# E.20 BER normalization uncertainty
This uncertainty occurs only when non standard settings are used to speed up
TRS measurement. It can be calculated using following formula:
$U_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\sqrt{\left( \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRSref}}}{2}
\right)^{2} + \left( \frac{U_{\text{SingleTRSfast}}}{2}
\right)^{2}}}{\sqrt{N_{\text{ref}}}}$ ,
Where
$U_{\text{SingleTRSref}}$ is the statistical uncertainty of the used reference
measurement,
$U_{\text{SingleTRSfast}}$is the statistical uncertainty of the non standard
measurement,
$N_{\text{ref}}$Is the number of measured reference points.
# E.21 DUT sensitivity drift
Due to statistical uncertainty of BER measurement, drift in the TRS can not be
monitored similarly to TRP. An uncertainty value of 0.2dB can be used, or the
TRS drift should be measured, with a setup corresponding to the actual TRS
measurement.
# E.22 Cable loss measurement uncertainty
Before performing the calibration, cable losses have to be measured. This
measurement includes a standard uncertainty, which is composed of the
mismatch, and the insertion loss uncertainties. In the calibration
measurement, the transmitter part is composed with the calibration antenna,
cables, and signal generator. The receiver part is composed with the probe
antenna, cables, and measurement device.
The cable loss of transmitter and receiver parts should be measured
separately. By this way, the cable losses will be compliant with the cable
routing of the calibration stage. On the opposite, if the cable losses were
measured together at the same time, the measured values would include errors
from miscellaneous mismatch contributions, which do not appear in the cable
routing of the calibration stage.
The cable loss measurement uncertainty is the result of the RSS of the
uncertainty contributions listed in Table E.4.
Table E.4: Uncertainty contributions in the cable loss measurement
* * *
Description of uncertainty contribution Standard Uncertainty (dB) Mismatch
uncertainty of cable(s) receiver part  
Insertion loss of the cable(s) receiver part  
Measurement device: absolute level uncertainty  
Measurement device: linearity  
Mismatch uncertainty of cable(s) transmitter part  
Insertion loss of the cable(s) transmitter part  
Signal generator: absolute output level uncertainty  
Signal generator: output level stability uncertainty  
Cable loss measurement uncertainty (RSS)
* * *
# E.23 Signal generator: uncertainty of the absolute output level
The signal generator is only used at this stage. It substitutes the DUT by
feeding the calibration antenna with a known power level. The use of this
signal generator introduces an uncertainty on the absolute output level.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer's data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [6]).
# E.24 Signal generator: output level stability
The uncertainty on the output level stability has to be taken into account
only when the uncertainty of the absolute level is not considered.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer's data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [6]).
# E.25 Insertion loss: Calibration antenna feed cable
The feed cable of the calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. As a
result, this uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be measured or calculated from the manufacturer's data
in logs with a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [6]).
# E.26 Insertion loss: Calibration antenna attenuator (if used)
If a calibration antenna attenuator is used, it only appears in Stage 2. As a
result, this uncertainty has to be taken into account.
This uncertainty will be calculated from the manufacturer's data in logs with
a rectangular distribution (see clause 5.1.2 in [6]).
# E.26.A Chamber Statistical Ripple and Repeatability
The uncertainty due to chamber statistics is determined by repeated
calibration measurements as described in Annex G.A. This uncertainty
contribution is a composite value consisting of most of the specific
reverberation chamber contributions, such as limited number of modes and mode-
stirring techniques.
The uncertainty contribution value shall be determined by measurements as
described in Annex G.A and be assumed to have a normal distribution.
# E.26.B Additional Power Loss in EUT Chassis
When the EUT is small and do not add noticeable loss to the chamber, the
calibration procedure outlined in section B.2, is performed without the EUT
present in the chamber. The possible difference in average chamber
transmission level between the EUT measurement and the reference measurement
must in this case be considered in the uncertainty evaluation.
The uncertainty value for this contribution can be tested empirically by
choosing a unit within a set of samples which is considered to incur the
highest amount of loss (normally the largest unit), and measure the average
transmission loss in the chamber with and without the test unit present in the
chamber. The difference between the two cases shall be used in the uncertainty
calculation and the distribution should be assumed to be rectangular.
Alternatively, a fixed value of 0.2 dB with a rectangular distribution can be
used in the uncertainty calculations.

###### ## Annex G (informative): Anechoic Chamber Specifications and
Validation Method
This Appendix presents the specifications for the shielded anechoic chamber
and the validation methods.
# G.1 Shielded anechoic chamber specifications
To avoid environmental perturbations the measurements shall be performed in a
shielded enclosure, preserved from electromagnetic disturbances coming from
electromagnetic environment (Radio and TV broadcast, cellular, ISM equipment,
etc...). The shielding effectiveness shut be tested according to the EN 50
147-1 standard in the frequency range of 800 MHz up to 4 GHz.
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz.
Testing of the shielding effectiveness can be performed either before or after
the installation of absorbers.
# G.2 Quiet Zone reflectivity level validation
The performance of anechoic chamber is typically evaluated from reflectivity
level $R_{\text{level}}$ in the quiet zone. Reflectivity level is defined as
power ratio of [all]{.underline} summed reflected signals $P_{r}$ to direct
signal $P_{d}$ from antenna:
$R_{\text{level}} = \text{10}\text{log}\frac{P_{r}}{P_{d}}$ .
To evaluate the quiet zone reflectivity level, the contribution of absorbing
materials, the antenna positioning system and other constructions in the
anechoic chamber should be measured.
To measure accurately quality of the quite zone in anechoic chamber an omni-
directional antenna shall be used. Near omni-directional three axes field-
probes are available with fibre optic connection thus minimizing cable
effects. Because sensitivity of field probe is limited it shall be carefully
checked that the field probe is operated at least 6dB above the noise floor of
the probe.
NOTE: The quiet zone evaluation should be performed with the antenna
positioning system in its place, in order to include its effect on the
reflectivity level.
## G.2.1 Description of a practical method for Quiet Zone characterization
In the following, a practical version of the Free Space VSWR method is
presented.
In the Free Space VSWR method the quality of quite zone is measured from
amplitude ripple caused by reflections inside the anechoic chamber. Phase
variation of the direct signal and the reflected signals is obtained by moving
a field-probe in the quiet zone. Amplitude ripple in the quiet zone is caused
by this phase variation of reflected signals and the direct signal from
antenna. The figure 2 below shows seven measuring positions.
{width="5.0625in" height="2.28125in"}
Figure G.2: Measurement positions with 150mm separation
In each of the seven-measurement position amplitude of power received by
field-probe $P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$[dBm] is measured where $n$is index of
measuring position. Variance of measurement distance to the antenna from
field-probe in different measurement positions can be compensated by following
equation:
where,
$d_{n}$is distance to point $n$ from the antenna,
$l$is distance to centre of quiet zone from the antenna
$P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$is uncorrected measurement value from point $n$.
The sample standard deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone can be
calculated from these distance corrected values or directly from the measured
values with the following equation:
where,
$N$ is number of measurements positions
$\overline{P}$ is dB average of all $P_{n}$
$P_{i}$ is $P_{n}$ or $P_{\text{meas}_{n}}$
# G.3 FFS
# G.4 Standard deviation of electric field
To obtain more accurate picture of quality of quiet zone, measurement
described in previous chapter can be done from multiple directions and
polarizations. Doing free space VSWR measurement from different directions in
15-degree separation for elevation and azimuth we get 264 standard deviation
values in both polarizations ($s_{\theta,\Phi,\text{pol}}$). From these values
average sample standard deviation in electric field in quiet zone can be
calculated from equation:
where,
$I$ is number of angular intervals in elevation,
$J$ is number of angular intervals in azimuth and
$\Theta_{i}$ is elevation of measurement $s_{i,j,\text{pol}}$.
This quiet zone quality measurement should be done at all the frequencies used
in measurements, but can be sufficient on all the centre frequencies in the
measurement bands but also in this case the Tx and Rx shall be measured
separately.
###### ## Annex G.A (informative): Reverberation Chamber Specifications and
Validation Method
This Annex presents the specifications for the shielded reverberation chamber
and the validation methods.
# G.A.1 Shielded reverberation chamber specifications
Before measuring the test site characteristics in terms of stirring
effectiveness etc., the shielding effectiveness of the metallic enclosure must
be measured.
To avoid environmental perturbations the measurements must be performed in a
shielded enclosure, preserved from electromagnetic disturbances coming from
electromagnetic environment (Radio and TV broadcast, cellular, ISM equipment,
etc...). The shielding effectiveness recommended to be tested according to the
EN 50 147-1 standard in the frequency range of 800 MHz up to 4 GHz.
The recommended level of the shielding effectiveness is -100 dB from 800 MHz
to 4 GHz.
# G.A.2 Reverberation chamber statistical ripple and repeatability validation
The reverberation chamber is typically evaluated according to its isotropy
level and ability to produce independent samples. The uncertainty due to
chamber statistics is determined by repeated calibration measurements as
described in Annex B.2. This uncertainty contribution is a composite value
consisting of most of the specific reverberation chamber contributions, such
as limited number of modes, polarization imbalance and mode-stirring
techniques.
The uncertainty contribution value shall be determined by repeated calibration
measurements for nine different positions and orientations of the calibration
antenna in order to determine the statistical variation as a function of
frequency, or at least at the frequencies where the chamber shall be used.
This uncertainty contribution value can be assumed to have a normal
distribution.
The uncertainty will depend on chamber size, frequency, stirrer sequence,
stirrer types and shapes, polarization stirring (if any), and the degree of
chamber loading. All these factors must remain the same for all nine
calibration measurements. The uncertainty will also depend on frequency
stirring bandwidth (if any), but the effects of different amounts of frequency
stirring can be studied with the same sets of calibration data as when no
frequency stirring is applied.
The nine net average power transfer functions of all or some of the nine
calibration configurations for each loading case shall be averaged to provide
a good reference level. Frequency stirring can only be applied to improve the
reference level. Therefore, the uncertainty shall be found by computing the
average and standard deviation of the net average power transfer function of
each of the nine reference (antenna) positions and orientations (without
frequency stirring) around the reference level (which can be frequency stirred
if it gives better overall accuracy).
The data obtained during these reference measurements can be used for analysis
of the chamber's systematic and deterministic contribution to S21. Such
analysis can help determine possible uncertainty sources in chambers where the
"chamber statistics" portion of the uncertainty analysis is too high to fulfil
the total uncertainty criterion. The normalized standard deviation is
calculated using the following expression:
where
is the standard deviation of the power transfer function over T different
calibration antenna positions. $P_{\text{ref},t}$ is the reference power
transfer function for position _t_ of the calibration antenna. The power
transfer function for every calibration antenna position is further the
average over the power transfer function $P_{\text{ref},t,n}$ for each fixed
measurement antenna in the chamber defined in Annex B.2. Thus,
where _N_ is the total number of fixed measurement antennas. Moreover,
is the average power transfer function over the _T_ calibration antenna
positions.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Recommended performance
# H.1 General
This annex introduces the concept of recommended OTA performance for operating
bands. This requirement is not mandatory but is recommended.
The concept of recommended performance is to ensure that UE/MS OTA performance
is maximised in order to improve user experience and network performance. It
is recognised that the ability to meet the recommended performance depends on
the number of frequency bands supported by the UE/MS.
# H.2 Total Radiated Power
The OTA performance for FDD, GSM and TDD should be greater or equal than the
recommended values shown in Tables H.1, H.1A, H.1B, H.2, H.2A, H.2B, H.2C
H.2D, and H.2E, respectively.
