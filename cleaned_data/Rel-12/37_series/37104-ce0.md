## 4.1 Relation between the MSR specification and the single-RAT
specifications
The requirements for MSR are in most parts specified in the present document,
while many requirements are also specified through normative references to the
respective single-RAT specifications in [2], [3], [4] and [5]. The resulting
set of requirements for an MSR BS can be divided into three types, depending
on their relation to the single-RAT specifications:
1\. **Generic MSR requirement:** A common generic requirement is specified in
the present document that applies for all RATs and for BS configured for both
multi-RAT and single-RAT operation. In some cases, there are additional
requirement(s) that apply only in some Band Category. There are no references
to the single-RAT specifications.
2\. **Generic MSR requirement, with additional single-RAT requirements:** A
common generic requirement is specified in the present document which applies
as in point 1. In addition some single RAT requirement(s) apply, included by
normative reference(s) to the single-RAT specification(s).
3\. **Single-RAT only requirements:** In this case, no common generic
requirement is defined. The existing single-RAT requirement applies for each
RAT, included by normative reference(s) to the single-RAT specification(s).
The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 5.
## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 37.141 [10] defines Test
Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements. For some requirements, including
regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to zero.
For MSR single-RAT requirements, the principle used to define the test
requirement remains from the existing specifications.
For both MSR single-RAT and multi-RAT requirements, the measurement results
returned by the Test System are compared - without any modification - against
the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk principle. The Shared Risk
principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [9].
## 4.3 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 9 and 10.
Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
For GSM/EDGE operation of an MSR BS, the requirements according to the
applicable multicarrier BTS class apply. The Wide Area BS, Medium Range BS and
Local Area BS in the present specification correspond to the Wide Area
multicarrier BTS, Medium Range multicarrier BTS and Local Area multicarrier
BTS respectively in the GSM/EDGE specifications. MSR requirements for multi-
RAT operation only apply for the highest GSM/EDGE static power step.
## 4.4 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may be
applied differently in different regions. There are additional single-RAT
regional requirements that may apply. These are referenced from the present
specification, but listed in the specification for the RATs concerned
[2][3][4][5].

Clause number Requirement Comments 4.5 Operating bands and Band Categories
Some bands may be applied regionally. 6.2.2 Base station output power These
requirements apply in Japan for an E-UTRA BS operating in band 34 and Band 41.
6.6.1.1 Mandatory requirements (spurious emissions) Category A limits are
mandatory for regions where Category A limits for spurious emissions, as
defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [2] apply. Category B limits are
mandatory for regions where Category B limits for spurious emissions, as
defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [2] apply. 6.6.1.3 Additional spurious
emissions requirements These requirements may be applied for the protection of
system operating in frequency ranges other than the MSR BS operating band.
6.6.1.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements In addition to the
requirements in subclauses 6.6.1.1, 6.6.1.2 and 6.6.1.3, the BS may have to
comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [8],
when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer. 6.6.1.4 Co-location (spurious
emissions) These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when a BS operating in another frequency band is co-located with an
MSR BS. 6.6.2.4.1 Additional requirement (Operating band unwanted emissions)
In addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.2.1 and 6.6.2.2, the BS may
have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47
[8], when deployed in regions where those limits are applied and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer. 6.6.2.4.2 Unsynchronized operation
for BC3 (Operating band unwanted emissions) The requirements for
unsynchronized TDD co-existence may apply regionally. 6.6.2.4.3 Protection of
DTT (Operating band unwanted emissions) The requirements for protection of DTT
may apply regionally. 6.6.2.4.4 Co-existence with services in adjacent
frequency bands (Operating band unwanted emissions) This regional requirement
may be applied for the protection of systems operating in frequency bands
adjacent to band 1 as defined in clause 4.5, in geographic areas in which both
an adjacent band service and UTRA and/or Eâ€‘UTRA are deployed. 6.6.2.4.6
Additional requirements for band 41 (Operating band unwanted emissions) These
requirements may apply in certain regions as additional Operating band
unwanted emission limits. 6.6.2.4.7 Additional band 32 unwanted emissions
These requirements may apply in certain regions 6.6.3 Occupied bandwidth The
requirement may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the Occupied bandwidth according to the definition. 6.7.4
Additional requirements These requirements may apply in certain regions. 7.5.2
Co-location requirement (blocking) These requirements may be applied for the
protection of the BS receiver when a BS operating in another frequency band is
co-located with an MSR BS.
* * *
## 4.5 Operating bands and Band Categories
MSR requirements are applicable for band definitions and band numbering as
defined in the specifications TS 45.005 [5], TS25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3] and
TS 36.104 [4]. For the purpose of defining the BS requirements, the operating
bands are divided into three band categories as follows:
\- Band Category 1 (BC1): Bands for E-UTRA FDD and UTRA FDD operation
\- Band Category 2 (BC2): Bands for E-UTRA FDD, UTRA FDD and GSM/EDGE
operation
\- Band Category 3 (BC3): Bands for E-UTRA TDD and UTRA TDD operation
NOTE: For UTRA TDD, requirements in the present document cover the 1.28 Mcps
UTRA TDD option.
The paired and unpaired bands for the three Band Categories are shown in Table
4.5-1 and 4.5-2, together with the corresponding E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE
band designations. In the present specification, the operating band of an MSR
Base Stations is designated using the E-UTRA band number according to the
tables.

E-UTRA is designed to operate for the carrier aggregation bands defined in
Tables 5.5-2, 5.5-3 and 5.5.4 of TS 36.104 [4]. The E-UTRA channel bandwidth
BW~Channel~ for a single carrier and the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth
BW~Channel_CA~ for E-UTRA carrier aggregation are specified in Section 5.6 of
TS 36.104 [4].
### 4.5.1 Band category 1 aspects (BC1)
For each BC1 band, BC1 requirements for receiver and transmitter shall apply
with a frequency offset **F~offset,\ RAT~** from the Lowest and Highest
Carriers to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and sub-block edges (if any)
as defined in Table 4.5.1-1.

* * *
## 4.6 Channel arrangement
### 4.6.1 Channel spacing
The GSM/EDGE carrier spacing is 200 kHz [5].
The nominal UTRA FDD channel spacing is 5 MHz. The nominal channel spacing is
1.6MHz for the 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD Option. These can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario [2,3].
In E-UTRA the spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario,
the size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as
following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario [4].
### 4.6.1A CA Channel spacing
For contiguously aggregated carriers the channel spacing between adjacent
component carriers shall be multiple of 300 kHz.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA carriers is
defined as follows:
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1 with values in
MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 4.6.2 Channel raster
The GSM/EDGE channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands [5].
The UTRA FDD and TDD channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that
the centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a
number of additional centre frequencies are specified for UTRA FDD according
to [2], which means that the centre frequencies for UTRA FDD channels are
shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.
The E-UTRA channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz [4].
### 4.6.3 Carrier frequencies and numbering
The carrier frequencies and corresponding numbering is defined for each RAT in
the respective specifications TS 36.104 [4] TS25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3] and TS
45.005 [5]. In the context of MSR, the frequency numbering scheme for each RAT
will remain.
\- The E-UTRA carrier frequency numbering (EARFCN) is defined in subclause 5.7
of TS 36.104 [4].
\- The UTRA FDD carrier frequency numbering (UARFCN) is defined in subclause
5.4 of TS 25.104 [2].
\- The UTRA TDD carrier frequency numbering (UARFCN) is defined in subclause
5.4 of TS 25.105 [3].
\- The GSM/EDGE carrier frequency numbering (ARFCN) is defined subclause 2 of
TS 45.005 [5].
NOTE: The numbering schemes for UTRA FDD and TDD are not coordinated, while
both are called UARFCN.
## 4.7 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where an MSR BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum operation
and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For MSR BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply both
at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the sub-block gaps. For each
such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges respectively.
## 4.8 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation. In the case of
multiband operation of a BS, single-RAT operation and the corresponding
applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined based
on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless otherwise
stated.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to each antenna connector.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to the antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting BC3 bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume synchronized operation, where
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
The RF requirements in the present specification are FFS for multi-band
operation supporting bands for both FDD and TDD.
# 5 Applicability of requirements
## 5.1 Band category 1
For all BS operating in bands belonging to Band Category 1, the RF
requirements listed in Table 5.1-1 apply for each supported operating band.
Requirements apply according to the RAT configuration of the Base Station, as
listed in the heading of the table. Some requirements listed in the table may
not be mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further specified
in the clause of each requirement and in Table 4.4-1. For multiband operation,
the applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined
based on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless
otherwise stated.

## 5.2 Band category 2
For all BS operating in bands belonging to Band Category 2, the RF
requirements listed in Table 5.2-1 apply for each supported operating band.
Requirements apply according to the RAT configuration of the Base Station, as
listed in the heading of the table. Some requirements listed in the table may
not be mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further specified
in the clause of each requirement and in Table 4.4-1. For multiband operation,
the applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined
based on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless
otherwise stated.

## 5.4 Inclusion of requirements by reference
Many requirements in the present specification are not explicitly stated in
the clauses listed in Tables 5.1-1, 5.2-1 and 5.3-1, but are instead included
by reference to the respective single-RAT specifications. Each reference is
normative and identifies the clause where the requirement is specified.
In some cases, the referenced clause may contain requirements that for
different reasons do not apply for an MSR base station. It is in those cases
stated that "applicable parts of" the referenced clause apply. What parts are
applicable is determined by the scope of the MSR specification. For example:
\- In a referenced clause including requirements for multiple operating bands,
only requirements for bands listed in the present document apply.
\- In a referenced clause that includes requirements for different types of
base stations, only requirements for the BS classes specified for each RAT
apply, see subclause 4.3.
# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier transmission
with multiple transmitter antenna connectors, transmit diversity, DB-DC-HSDPA
or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter antenna
connector.
A BS supporting DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA transmits two UTRA FDD cells
simultaneously. A BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two UTRA FDD cells
simultaneously on adjacent carrier frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test port B).
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in subclause 6 applies at all times,
i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter OFF period and the
Transmitter transient period.

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
[6]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics
emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is specified in
terms of an Operating band unwanted emissions requirement that defines limits
for emissions in each supported downlink operating band plus the frequency
ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below each band. Emissions outside of this
frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.
There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth and an ACLR
requirement applicable for some RATs.
### 6.6.1 Transmitter spurious emissions
The transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz,
excluding the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the
downlink operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple
bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, this exclusion applies for
each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where
multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band
requirements apply and the multi-band exclusions and provisions are not
applicable.
Exceptions are the requirements in Table 6.6.1.3.1-2 and specifically stated
exceptions in Table 6.6.1.3.1-1 that apply also closer than 10 MHz from the
downlink operating band. For some operating bands the upper frequency limit is
higher than 12.75 GHz.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered. It
applies for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean
power (RMS).
#### 6.6.1.1 Mandatory Requirements
The requirements of either subclause 6.6.1.1.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 6.6.1.1.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. In addition for a BS
operating in Band Category 2, the requirements of 6.6.1.1.3 shall apply in
case of Category B limits when GSM/EDGE is configured.
##### 6.6.1.1.1 Minimum requirement (Category A)
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table

##### 6.6.1.1.3 Additional minimum requirement for BC2 (Category B)
For a BS operating in Band Category 2 when GSM/EDGE is configured, the power
of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table 6.6.1.1.3-1.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the limits in Table 6.6.1.1.3-1 are
only applicable when all supported operating bands belong to BC2 and GSM/EDGE
is configured in all bands.

#### 6.6.1.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS
This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent the
receivers of Base Stations being desensitised by emissions from the BS
transmitter. It is measured at the transmit antenna port for any type of BS
which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.
##### 6.6.1.2.1 Minimum Requirement
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table
6.6.1.2.1-1 depending on the declared Base Station class and Band Category.

#### 6.6.1.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the
present document is given in subclause 4.4.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below.
##### 6.6.1.3.1 Minimum Requirement
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.3.1-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system
listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.3.1-1 apply for
each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where
multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.3.1-1 apply for the operating
band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in
Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table
6.6.1.3.1-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside
the downlink operating band (see Tables 4.5-1 and 4.5-2). Emission limits for
this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 4.5-1 or Table 4.5-2 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-
existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements
are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and
10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.3.1-2: BS Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with
PHS
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 1884.5 â€‘ 1915.7 MHz
-41 dBm 300 kHz Applicable for co-existence with PHS system operating in
1884.5-1915.7MHz NOTE: The requirement is not applicable in China.
* * *
The following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 41 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range
from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to
10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.3.1-3: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 41
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 2505MHz -- 2535MHz
-42dBm 1 MHz  
2535MHz -- 2655MHz -22dBm 1 MHz Applicable at offsets â‰¥ 250% of channel
bandwidth from carrier frequency
NOTE: This requirement applies for 10 or 20 MHz E-UTRA carriers allocated
within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-2645MHz.
* * *
The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 30 in certain
regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10
MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz
above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.3.1-4: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 30
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 2200MHz -- 2345MHz
-45dBm 1 MHz  
2362.5MHz -- 2365MHz -25dBm 1 MHz  
2365MHz -- 2367.5MHz -40dBm 1 MHz  
2367.5MHz -- 2370MHz -42dBm 1 MHz  
2370MHz -- 2**395** MHz -45dBm 1 MHz
* * *
In addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.1.1, 6.6.1.2 and above in
the present subclause, the BS may have to comply with the applicable emission
limits established by FCC Title 47 [8], when deployed in regions where those
limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.
#### 6.6.1.4 Co-location with other base stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
##### 6.6.1.4.1 Minimum Requirement
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.4.1-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed
in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For
BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
column of Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.4.1-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the
co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
downlink operating band (see Tables 4.5-1 and 4.5-2). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [7].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.5-1 or Table
4.5-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the
same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
### 6.6.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are
defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink
operating band to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\
RF,low~ and from the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\
RF,high~ up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
operating band.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification,
except for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation. The
requirements in TS 45.005 [5] as defined in subclause 6.6.2.3 apply to an MSR
Base Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band
Category 2.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter-RF Bandwidth gap are
not applicable.
#### 6.6.2.1 General minimum requirement for Band Categories 1 and 3
For a Wide Area BS operating in Band Category 1 or Band Category 3 the
requirement applies outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition,
for a Wide Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a Wide Area BS operating in multiple bands,
the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For a Medium Range BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Medium Range
BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap.
In addition, for a Medium Range BS operating in multiple bands, the
requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For a Local Area BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Local Area BS
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap. In
addition, for a Local Area BS operating in multiple bands, the requirements
apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
Outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, emissions shall not exceed the
maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.2.1-1 to 6.6.2.1-4 below, where:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency
and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the downlink
operating band.
\- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
For a BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with
Wgap \ abs(800) kHz for CW interferer NOTE: Interfering signal
positions that are partially or completely outside of any downlink operating
band of the base station are excluded from the requirement.
* * *
### 6.7.3 Additional minimum requirement (BC3)
The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits in subclause 6.6.1, 6.6.2, 6.6.4 in the presence of a wanted signal and
an interfering signal according to Table 6.7.3-1 for BS operation in BC3.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each operating band. In case the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap is less than 3.2 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only
for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
Table 6.7.3-1: Interfering signals for the Transmitter intermodulation
requirement (BC3)
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal type | 1.28Mcps UTRA TDD signal of | | | channel bandwidth 1.6MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal level | Rated total output power in the | | | operating band -- 30dB | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal centre | Â±0.8 MHz | | frequency offset from Base | | | Station RF Bandwidth edge or | Â±1.6 MHz | | sub-block edge inside a gap | | | | Â±2.4 MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE: Interfering signal | | | positions that are partially or | | | completely outside of any | | | downlink operating band of the | | | base station are excluded from | | | the requirement. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
### 6.7.4 Additional requirements
In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For BS operating in
Band 41, the transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in Table 6.6.1.3.1-3, Table 6.6.2.4.6-1 and Table 6.6.4.1-2
with a square filter in the first adjacent channel, in the presence of an
interfering signal according to Table 6.7.4â€‘1.

# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity or in case of multi-carrier
reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, the requirements apply
for each receiver antenna connector.
For blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel frequency of the
lowest carrier frequency received and positive offsets of the interfering
signal apply relative to the assigned channel frequency of the highest carrier
frequency received .
A BS supporting DC-HSUPA receives two UTRA FDD cells simultaneously on
adjacent carrier frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. For FDD operation the
requirements in clause 7 shall be met with the transmitter(s) on. If any
external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS in FDD operation is configured to
transmit and receive at the same time.. The transmitter may be off for some of
the tests as specifed in 37.141 [10].
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the base
station receive period.

Nominal Error Rate and is specified in TS 45.005 [5], applicable parts of
subclause 6.1.1.1, 6.1.1.3, 6.1.2.2 and 6.1.3.2.
## 7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
The in-band selectivity and blocking characteristics are measures of the
receiver ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted interferer inside the operating band and are defined
by a (wideband) and a narrowband blocking requirement.
### 7.4.1 General blocking minimum requirement
For the general blocking requirement, the interfering signal shall be a UTRA
FDD signal as specified in Annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Radio

addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least
15 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block
edges inside the sub-block gap.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at least 15 MHz.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the base station antenna
input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.1â€‘1 and 7.4.1-2, the following
requirements shall be met:

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. In this
case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with
the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in subclause 6.6.1 are
valid.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported
on each antenna connector.
### 7.6.1 General minimum requirement
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.6.1-1:
Table 7.6.1-1: General spurious emissions requirement
* * *
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement Bandwidth Note 30MHz â€‘ 1 GHz -57 dBm
100 kHz  
1 GHz -- 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
12.75 GHz - 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the UL operating
band in GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz Applies only for Bands 22, 42 and 43. NOTE: The
frequency range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ -10 MHz to F~BW\ RF,,DLhigh~ + 10 MHz
may be excluded from the requirement. For BS capable of multi-band operation,
the exclusion applies for all supported operating bands. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the excluded frequency
range is only applicable for the operating band supported on each antenna
connector.
* * *
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.6.1-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the Additional spurious emissions requirements in
subclause 6.6.1.3 and in case of FDD BS (for BC1 and BC2) emission shall not
exceed the levels specified for Protection of the BS receivers of own or
different BS in subclause 6.6.1.2. In addition, the requirements for co-
location with other base stations specified in subclause 6.6.1.4 may also be
applied.
### 7.6.2 Additional minimum requirement for BC2 (Category B)
For a BS operating in Band Category 2 when GSM/EDGE is configured and where
Category B spurious emissions apply, the power of any spurious emissions shall
not exceed the limits in Table 7.6.2-1.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the limits in Table 7.6.2-1 are only
applicable when all supported operating bands belong to BC2 and GSM/EDGE is
configured in all bands.

MHz -47 dBm 3 MHz NOTE 1: For BS capable of multi-band operation, the
frequency offset is relative to the closest supported operating band.
* * *
## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.
### 7.7.1 General intermodulation minimum requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal as
specified in Annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Radio
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at least twice as
wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset from the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the inter Base Station
RF Bandwidth gap.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the base station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.1-1 and 7.7.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104 [4],
subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [2], subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005 [5],
Annex P.2.2.

### 7.7.2 General narrowband intermodulation minimum requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified
in Annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Radio
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.
For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within each supported operating
band, the requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap in case the
sub-block gap is at least as wide as the channel bandwidth of the E-UTRA
interfering signal in Table 7.7.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the sub-block edges inside the gap.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.7.2-2. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the base station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.2-1 and 7.7.2-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104 [4],
subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [2], subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005 [5],
Annex P.2.2.
