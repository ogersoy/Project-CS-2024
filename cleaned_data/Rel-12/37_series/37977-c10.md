# 1 Scope
The present document is the technical report for the work item on MIMO OTA,
which was approved at TSG RAN#55 [13]. The scope of the WI is to define a 3GPP
methodology or set of comparable methodologies for measuring the radiated
performance of multiple antenna reception and MIMO receivers in the UE. The
test methodology should be relevant for HSPA and LTE technologies, with
particular focus on handheld devices and devices embedded in laptop computers.
RAN WG4 has been working on the study item \"Measurement of radiated
performance for MIMO and multi-antenna reception for HSPA and LTE terminals\"
with the objective to define a test methodology for measuring the radiated
performance of MIMO and multi-antenna UE reception in UMTS and LTE.
RAN4 has done sufficient work to be confident that the definition of a
meaningful test methodology is feasible; however RAN4 does not have sufficient
evidence yet to conclude on a single test methodology that would fulfil all
requirements for standardisation, and the standardisation of multiple test
methodologies may be one eventual outcome, with a view to avoid differences in
the decision of what is a \"good\" or \"bad\" device from the radiated
receiver performance perspective.

# 4 Introduction
## 4.1 Background
The use of MIMO and receiver diversity in the UE is expected to give large
gains in downlink throughput performance for HSPA and LTE devices. 3GPP
already defined conducted tests for MIMO and multiple antenna receivers (type
1 and type 3 in TS 25.101 for HSPA demodulation), but it is clear that the
ability to duplicate these gains in the field is highly dependent on the
performance of the receive-antenna system.
At TSG RAN#41, Sep 2008, it was indicated that there is a need for a test
methodology to be created with the aim of measuring and verifying the radiated
performance of multi-antenna and MIMO receiver in UEs for both HSPA and LTE
devices. As an outcome of the discussion, an LS was sent to COST 2100 SWG2.2
and CTIA ERP to ask them for feedback on their plans/ongoing work in this
area, and also the timescales for which such work could be completed to define
such a methodology, with particular focus on handheld devices and devices
embedded in laptop computers.
Since then, feedback from COST 2100 and CTIA has suggested they are happy to
work on this topic. However, given that 3GPP is the customer for this work as
well as being a potential contributor, it is important to aim for commonly-
accepted measurement and test methodology to be used across the industry.
## 4.2 Work item objective
The high level objective of this work item is to define a test methodology
(ies) for verifying the radiated performance of multiple antenna reception in
the UE and such methodology shall be able to:
\- Verify the radiated \"Over-The-Air\" (OTA) performance of multiple antenna
reception in the UE.
\- Accurately able to reflect MIMO and SIMO performance under realistic MIMO
and SIMO channel conditions. Be able to distinguish between UEs of \"Good\"
and \"Bad\" multi-Rx antenna OTA performance, and offer a good reflection of
the likely experience in the field.
\- Offer good reliability, repeatability and an acceptable level of
measurement uncertainty.
Such test methodology(ies) shall enable performance verification for:
\- Handheld devices, devices embedded in laptop computers, and other devices
(such as M2M equipment).
\- All transmission modes of LTE and HSDPA, including spatial multiplexing
(MIMO) and single spatial layer operation. However the transmission modes used
in the test shall be defined as part of the work.
\- Initially tests shall use of LTE Transmission Mode 3, Fixed Reference
Channel, and forced Rank 2. As the work progresses, other transmission modes
of LTE and HSPA shall be introduced.
\- The utilization of Variable Reference Channels and other-cell interference
shall also be studied at a later stage.
The following is required for the analysis phase of this work item:
\- In order to compare results across the different methods, absolute
throughput shall be used as the Figure of Merit.
\- In order to analyse and accurately validate a method(s) the following work
shall be performed:
\- eNodeB settings shall be agreed.
\- Realistic MIMO conditions and realistic channel models shall be identified
to be used as a reference radio environment.
\- The MIMO conditions and channel models shall be validated for the proposed
test methods.
\- Calibration of the power levels in the methodology shall be performed.
\- The absolute throughput measured for each test method shall be compared
with the absolute throughput measured in the reference radio environment, in
order to identify the capability of each method to provide a measurement
result that matches what is observed in realistic environments.
\- In order to minimize the variables associated with testing of production
UEs with unknown antenna characteristics, utilize reference antennas in
combination with a known UE baseband receiver (verified via conducted RF tests
with and without channel impairments). This is intended to verify whether the
characteristics of the receive antenna design (i.e. correlation, gain
imbalance, etc) affecting receiver performance can be accurately distinguished
by proposed test methods.
In the event that more than one test methodology is agreed to be standardised,
differences between methodologies in the decision of what is a \"good\" or
\"bad\" device from the radiated receiver performance perspective shall be
avoided.
When selecting the method(s) for specification for LTE MIMO, applicability to
LTE-SIMO UMTS-SIMO/MIMO shall be described.
During the course of this Work Item, maintain ongoing communication with COST
and CTIA MOSG to ensure industry coordination on this topic and to distribute
tasks according to expertise or resource availability.
TSG RAN should contact TSG GERAN to get feedback on the applicability of such
a test methodology for GERAN.
## 4.3 High level requirements
The following high level requirements are agreed by RAN4:
1\. Measurement of radiated performance for MIMO and multi-antenna reception
for HSPA and LTE terminals must be performed over-the-air, i.e. without RF
cable connections to the DUT.
> NOTE 1: DUTs to the test house will have accessibility to temporary antenna
> port for conducted purposes.
>
> NOTE 2: Temporary antenna port is used to assess to DUT receiver.
>
> NOTE 3: UE special function to measure antenna pattern is not desirable for
> MIMO OTA purposes.
2\. The MIMO OTA method(s) must be able to differentiate between a good
terminal and a bad terminal in terms of MIMO OTA performance.
3\. The desired primary Figure Of Merit (FOM) is absolute throughput. This
will easily allow meaningful comparison of the ability of different methods to
evaluate MIMO OTA performance.
# 5 Performance metrics
## 5.1 Figure of Merits
Absolute throughput performance is used in order to be able to compare the
different proposed methodologies in their ability to distinguish good and bad
MIMO devices.
The performance metric applies to both HSPA and LTE system.
Other Figure of Merits and their applicability on the assessment of MIMO
performance is for further study.
### 5.1.1 Definition of MIMO throughput
MIMO throughput is defined here as the time-averaged number of correctly
received transport blocks in a communication system running an application,
where a Transport Block is defined in the reference measurement channel. From
OTA perspective, this is also called MIMO OTA throughput.
The MIMO OTA throughput is measured at the top of physical layer of HSPA and
LTE system. Therefore, this is also measured at the same point as in the
conductive measurement setup: under the use of FRC, the SS transmit fixed-size
payload bits to the DUT. The DUT signals back either ACK or NACK to the SS.
The SS then records the following:
 Number of ACKs,
 Number of NACKs, and
 Number of DTX TTIs
Hence the MIMO (OTA) throughput can be calculated as
where Transmitted TBS is the Transport Block Size transmitted by the SS, which
is fixed for a FRC during the measurement period. MeasurementTime is the total
composed of successful TTIs (ACK), unsuccessful TTIs (NACK) and DTX-TTIs.
The time-averaging is to be taken over a time period sufficiently long to
average out the variations due to the fading channel. Therefore, this is also
called the average MIMO OTA throughput. The throughput should be measured at a
time when eventual start-up transients in the system have evanesced.
### 5.1.2 Definition of Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)
Definition and applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation is FFS.
## 5.2 Averaging of throughput curves
There are different possibilities how to average the curves where throughput
(TP) was recorded as function of downlink (DL) power (expressed in RS EPRE) or
of Signal-to-Interference (SIR) level. Averages shall be calculated by the
following formula.
### 5.2.1 Average of power levels
The averaging of DL power (or SIR) is the first possibility. The power levels
are summed similar to the formula used for TIS evaluation, i.e. using the
inverse of power. The formula to use is:
For every selected TP value _y_ a corresponding power level _P~n~_(_y_) can be
found, and summed over all _N_ conditions.\ The subscript \"_inv_ \" is used
to indicate that the inverse sum of power values is taken.
The power levels have to be converted to linear values in mW before the
summation takes place, and the average then can be reconverted to dBm / 15 kHz
for RS EPRE or dB for SIR.
Since the recording of the TP curves is done with fixed steps in power, only
few TP values are available.\ In order to calculate the correct average, the
TP curves have to be interpolated, and a fixed set of _y_ values for TP can be
used for generating the curve of _P~avg~_(_y_).
In the case that a curve was not recorded down to 0 % TP, it shall be
extrapolated from the point taken with lowest TP to TP = 0 using the same
power level.
If a curve did not reach nominal TP, it shall be extrapolated it in a way that
it would reach nominal TP at the lowest power level where it was reaching its
individual maximum TP value.
The average TP curve shall only be calculated up to a TP value which equals to
the average of all individual maximum TP values.

### 6.3.1 Methodologies based on Anechoic RF Chamber
An OTA method based on the use of an Anechoic RF Chamber is described
consisting of a number of test antenna probes located in the chamber
transmitting signals with temporal and spatial characteristics for testing
multiple antenna devices.
This clause describes the methodologies based on Anechoic RF Chamber, where a
number of test antennas are located in different positions of the chamber, and
the Device Under Test (DUT) is located at center position. The DUT is tested
over the air without RF cables.
#### 6.3.1.1 Candidate Solution 1
An OTA method based on the use of an Anechoic RF Chamber is described
consisting of a number of test antennas located in the chamber transmitting
signals with temporal and spatial characteristics for testing multiple antenna
devices. The method consists of a number of test antennas located in different
positions of the chamber, and the device under test (DUT) is located at the
center position. The DUT is tested over the air without RF cables.
The Anechoic chamber techniques creates a realistic geometric based spatio-
temporal-polarimetric radio channel for testing MIMO performance using
Geometric based stochastic channel models as defined in Clause 8.2.
The components of the solution include:
\- Anechoic Chamber
\- System Simulator (SS)
\- N channel RF emulator, with OTA Channel Generation Features
\- N linearly polarized antenna elements configured V, H or co-located V&H or
slant X polarizations
\- K azimuthally separated antenna positions with predefined angles at radius
R
\- Channel model definition for each test case
An illustration of an anechoic chamber is shown in Figure 6.3.1.1-1 below.

Figure 6.3.1.1-2: OTA system level block diagram
A system level block diagram is shown in Figure 6.3.1.1-2, which includes the
SS to generate the M branch MIMO signal, and an RF Channel Emulator with an
OTA Channel Generation Feature to properly correlate, fade, scale, delay, and
distribute the signal to each test probe in the chamber. For the selected
environmental conditions modelled by the SCME UMa and UMi channel models, the
minimum setup configuration can be described as below:

implementations\ using the Anechoic Chamber Methodology

setup Applicable channel model SCME UMa/SCME UMi Single Cluster UMa and Single
Cluster UMi
* * *
The full SCME or Multi-Cluster channel models are defined in Clause 8.2. The
Single-Cluster model, which is not part of the set of channel models validated
in clause 8, would be based on the channel models defined in section 8.2 with
a set of dithered AoAs around zero degrees.
##### 6.3.1.1.1 Concept and configuration
For MIMO OTA modelling the geometric channel models are mapped into the fading
emulator, converting the geometric channel models into the emulator tap
coefficients. This process is illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.1.1-1.
Figure 6.3.1.1.1-1: Modelling process
The setup of OTA chamber antennas with eight antenna positions is depicted in
Figure 6.3.1.1.1-2. The DUT is at the center, and the antennas are in a circle
around the DUT with uniform spacing (e.g. 45° with 16 elements arranged in 8
positions, where each position contains a vertically and horizontally
polarized antenna pair). Denoting directions of _K_ OTA antennas with _θ~k~_ ,
_k_ = 1, ..., _K_ , and antenna spacing in the angle domain with _∆θ_. Each
antenna is connected to a single fading emulator output port. In the figure,
for example, antenna A~1V~ denotes the first OTA antenna position and
Vertically (V) polarized element, A~8H~ denotes the eight OTA antenna position
and horizontally (H) polarized element, etc.

NOTE: In the drawing the V-polarized elements are actually orthogonal to the
paper (azimuth plane)
Figure 6.3.1.1.1-2: OTA chamber antenna setup with\ eight uniformly spaced
dual polarized chamber antennas
##### 6.3.1.1.2 Scalability of the methodology
The number of antennas is scalable. In theory, there is no upper limit and the
lower limit is one. The required number of channels depends on three main
aspects: channel model, DUT size, and polarization. The key question is how
accurately the channel model is emulated. Based on the quiet zone discussion,
it was proposed to use 8 antennas in the case of single polarization and 16
antennas in the case of dual polarization. However, for single cluster case,
fewer antennas may be enough. On the other hand, if elevation is needed, the
antenna number will be higher. Additionally, the antenna positions can be
adjusted to optimize the accuracy with limited number of antennas.
Another aspect is the channel model. Most of the Geometry-based Stochastic
Channel Models (GSCMs) are two-dimensional, i.e. azimuth plane only, but the
proposed MIMO OTA concept is not limited to the azimuth plane.\ It can also be
extended to elevation plane, when we talk about 3D MIMO OTA. However, the 3D
MIMO OTA is rather complex and it does not provide very much additional
information about the DUT. Therefore, 3D MIMO OTA can be considered as one
future development, but it is not the recommended solution in the beginning of
MIMO OTA testing.
Downscaling of the proposed method is more attractive due to the possibility
to save the cost of the test system.\ Full SCME requires multiple antennas,
but single cluster SCME can be implemented with lower number of antennas than
full SCME. The same downscaling benefits of the single-cluster model apply
based on DUT size. The difference between full SCME and Single Cluster model
is depicted in Figure 6.3.1.1.2-1. Basically the only difference is that the
mean Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of each cluster is turned to the same primary
direction. If all AoA's were identical, it would be a problematic case as it
locks all like-angle sub-paths together with identical Doppler, which results
in a breakdown of the model. With slight dithering as in the example that the
AoAs = [0 -1 1 -2 2 -3] degrees, the angle spread after dithering increases
from 35.00 to 35.02 degrees, which is not significant, however the model now
performs as expected. Obviously, one primary cluster requires a lower number
of antennas than multiple clusters especially when angular spread is narrow,
e.g. 35 degrees. The number of fading channels is the same as the number of
antennas.\ Therefore, single cluster SCME would require less fading channels
as well.

##### 6.3.1.1.3 Test conditions
This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits and is
applicable to any 3GPP release.\ It supports different channel models from SCM
to IMT-Advanced. Due to its generality, it does not restrict the test
conditions. However, for simplicity, it is good to start from downlink
throughput testing.
The downlink throughput testing can be done e.g. in the following manner.
BS transmits signal through a radio channel emulator. This signal is routed to
several antennas in anechoic chamber. The DUT is placed at center of the
chamber and the performance is measured from the DUT.
\- OTA antennas are located along a circle around the DUT;
\- The circular geometry is needed because we need signal from many directions
at the same time (requirement from the channel models).
The test steps can be, e.g., according to [3] or as follows:
1) Calibrate the full system with a test signal;
2) Set the first test case (e.g. channel model) to the fading emulator;
3) Generate test signal by the communication tester / BS emulator;
4) Measure the DUT performance (downlink throughput);
5) If the performance exceeds the specified limit, the DUT passes the test
case;
6) If all test cases done, go to step 7. Otherwise, set the next test case
(e.g. channel model) to the fading emulator and go back to step 3.
7) If DUT passed all the test cases, the DUT passes the full MIMO OTA test;
8) If DUT failed in at least one test case, the DUT failed the full MIMO OTA
test.
#### 6.3.1.2 Void
#### 6.3.1.3 Candidate solution 3
The principle of two-stage MIMO OTA method is based on the assumption that the
far-field antenna radiation pattern will contain all the necessary information
for evaluation the antenna\'s performance like radiation power, efficiency and
correlation and that with channel model approaches, the influence of antenna
radiation pattern can be correctly incorporated into the channel model. Thus
the method will first measure the MIMO antenna patterns and then incorporate
the measurement antenna patterns with chosen MIMO OTA channel models for real-
time emulation.\ In order to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the
intact device, the chipset needs to support amplitude and relative phase
measurements of the antennas. If the EUT has dynamic antenna tuning elements,
detailed information on the implementation is required to understand the
consequences for the pattern measurement.\ The BTS and DUT can then be
connected to the real-time channel emulator through the standard temporary
antenna connectors or by using a calibrated radiated connection to do the test
on throughput, etc., to test how the MIMO antennas will influence the
performance.
It should be noted that should this methodology be chosen for conformance
testing, the method for antenna gain and phase measurement would require to be
standardized.\ The details for proposed antenna gain and phase measurements
are FFS.\ Further details will be provided before the RAN4 evaluation of this
methodology can progress.
##### 6.3.1.3.1 Concept and configuration
The assumption of the two-stage MIMO OTA method is that the measured far field
antenna pattern of the multiple antennas can fully capture the mutual coupling
of the multiple antenna arrays and their influence.\ Thus to do the two-stage
MIMO OTA test, the antenna patterns of the antenna array needs to be measured
accurately in the first stage. In order to accurately measure the antenna
pattern of the intact device, the chipset needs to support amplitude and
relative phase measurements of the antennas.
**Stage 1:** Test multiple antennas system in a traditional anechoic chamber.
The chamber for antenna pattern measurement is set up as described in Annex
A.2 in [4], where the DUT is put into a chamber and each antenna element\'s
far zone pattern is measured. Clause B.4.3 gives description on how to measure
each antenna element\'s pattern using non-intrusive method. The influence of
human body loss can be measured by attaching the DUT to a SAM head and or hand
when doing the antenna pattern measurements. The DUT is placed against a SAM
phantom, and the characteristics of the SAM phantom are specified in Annex A.1
of [4]. The chamber is equipped with a positioner, which makes it possible to
perform full 3-D far zone pattern measurements for both Tx and Rx radiated
performance. The measurement antenna should be able to measure two orthogonal
polarizations (typically linear theta (θ) and phi (φ) polarizations as shown
in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1).

Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1: The coordinate system used in the measurements
**Stage 2:** Combine the antenna patterns measured in stage 1 into MIMO
channel model, emulate the MIMO channel model with the measured antenna
patterns incorporated in the commercial channel emulator and perform the OTA
test in conducted or calibrated radiated approach.
The MIMO OTA method based on the above mentioned two-stage method is
illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2. The integrated channel model with both MIMO
antenna effect and the multipath channel effect can be emulated with a
commercial MIMO channel emulator. The BS emulator is connected to the MIMO
channel emulator and then to the MIMO device\'s temporary antenna ports via
approved RF cables. These ports are the standard ones provided for conducted
conformance tests. An alternative to using a conducted connection is to use a
calibrated radiated connection in an anechoic environment. This technique
exploits the Eigen modes of the transmission channel to provide independent
radiated connections between the probe antennas and each receiver after the
antenna. By controlling the power settings of the channel emulator and also
the integrated channel model, the end-to-end throughput with the MIMO antenna
radiation influence can be measured using either connection method. The
radiated connection method intrinsically includes the effects of EUT self-
interference.
There are two different approaches to combine the antenna patterns with MIMO
channel model.
a) Apply antenna patterns to Ray-based channel models. Ray-based models are
capable to support arbitrary antenna patterns under predefined channel modes
in a natural way as described above. If Ray-based model like SCM model is
specified to be used for MIMO OTA test, then the channel emulator needs to be
able to support SCM channel model emulation and support loading measured
antenna patterns.
b) Apply antenna patterns to correlation-based channel models. MIMO channel
model. With a correlation matrix calculation method for arbitrary antenna
patterns under multipath channel conditions, the correlation matrix and the
antenna imbalance can be calculated and then emulated by the channel emulator.
c) This method can be used to measure the following figure of merit:
1) Throughput
2) TRP and TRS
3) CQI, BLER
4) Antenna efficiency and MEG
5) Antenna correlation, MIMO channel capacity.
> The coupling between the UE antenna and internal spurious emission of the UE
> might be characterized during the antenna pattern measurement stage inside
> the chamber by lowering down the signal power and is for further research.

Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2: Proposed two-stage test methodology for MIMO OTA test
The alternative radiated method of connecting to the EUT in the second stage
is shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3.
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3: Alternative radiated connection for two-stage test
methodology for MIMO OTA test
Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3 shows the fully radiated two-stage test setup. Two probe
antennas with polarization V and H are co-located in the anechoic chamber. The
only change from the conducted second stage is to replace the RF cables with
the radiated channel inside the chamber. Due to the propagation channel in the
chamber, signals transmitted from each probe antenna are received by both UE
antennas which is different from the cable conducted case where the signals
are isolated. However, by precoding the transmitted signals using spatial
multiplexing techniques it is possible by calculating the radiated channel
matrix and by applying its inverse to the transmitted signals, to create an
identity matrix allowing the transmitted signals to be received independently
at each receiver after the antenna thus recreating the cable conducted
situation but with radiated self-interference now included.

##### 6.3.1.3.2 Test conditions
This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits. It is
also applicable for any 3GPP Release, and even for other standards.
This method can reuse existing SISO OTA anechoic chambers to make the antenna
pattern measurements; the channel emulator number is required to match the
number of device receiver inputs regardless of the complexity of the chosen
channel model, the method is consequently easily scalable to higher order MIMO
due to the reduced number of instruments required; the channel models are
highly accurate due to being implemented electronically and are also fully
flexible and can be altered to suit any desired operating conditions such as
indoor-outdoor, high or low Doppler spread, high or low delay spread, beam
width, in 2D or full 3D etc.
This method requires the chipset in DUT to support amplitude and relative
phase measurements of the antennas, and it cannot directly measure self-
desensitization since the antenna pattern measurement does not take account of
possible signal leakage from the device transmit antennas into the receive
antennas.
The detailed test procedure can be found in Annex B.
#### 6.3.1.4 Candidate solution 4
##### 6.3.1.4.1 Concept and configuration
In this method an assessment of the antenna\'s performance in MIMO or
Diversity operation is performed. Several simplifications are used in order to
optimise the testing.
A test of the UE in an anechoic environment with the help of a base station
emulator is proposed, with a limited number of faded channels and transmitting
antennas, and in a simple geometrical set-up.
The underlying principle is to decompose the task for evaluating MIMO
performance. It combines the radiated measurements in the anechoic chamber
where no fading is applied with conducted measurements with fading. The total
performance of the UE is decomposed into these two steps, and therefore we
name it decomposition approach. Figure 6.3.1.4.1-1 illustrates this approach.
Figure 6.3.1.4.1-1: Diagram of decomposition approach for 2x2 LTE MIMO
##### 6.3.1.4.2 Decomposition approach
To determine the throughput results for the overall MIMO device performance,
the following key measurements are needed, as shown in Figure 6.3.1.4.2-1:
\- Baseline: the conducted measurement with channel model of the identity
matrix
\- Conducted: the conducted measurement with the real-world channel model
\- Radiated: the average of the radiated measurements for a set of antenna
constellations
Figure 6.3.1.4.2-1: Key measurements for Decomposition Approach
From these measurements, the receiver MIMO efficiency and the antenna MIMO
efficiency are determined as illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2. The receiver
MIMO efficiency is defined as the difference between the baseline conducted
test and the conducted test with dynamic fading as a function of throughput,
Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2 (a).\ Similarly, the antenna MIMO efficiency is defined as
the difference between the baseline conducted test and the radiated test for
all throughput levels, Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2 (b)
**\ (a)** \ \ **\ (b)**
Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2: Definition of (a) receiver MIMO and b) antenna MIMO
efficiencies
The relative Figure Of Merit (FOM) for the UE MIMO performance is subsequently
defined as the UE MIMO efficiency that is the sum of the receiver and antenna
MIMO efficiencies. By adding this efficiency to the baseline throughput curve,
the absolute FOM for the UE MIMO performance, i.e., decomposed throughput
curve as a function of DL power level, can be obtained as shown in
6.3.1.4.2-3.
Figure 6.3.1.4.2-3: Illustration of the decomposed throughput curve
calculation
##### 6.3.1.4.3 Conducted test
In the conducted tests, measurements with different channel models have to be
performed.
The most basic Channel Model (CM) is the identity static channel matrix
without fading.
This matrix provides a frequency-flat transfer characteristic that does not
change over time. Since non-diagonal elements of the channel matrix are zero,
each RF port of the UE receives a single LTE data stream. This ideal CM
characterizes the noise figure of the MIMO receiver and acts as a \"baseline\"
for further testing.
Another test has to be performed with the CM selected. Typically the channel
models are either based on SCME UMa or UMi. Since the channel models are
applied in conducted mode, the spatial information of the base station antenna
correlation is calculated numerically and implemented as coefficient alpha in
the fading model. The coefficient beta describing the correlation at the UE
side is set to zero.
##### 6.3.1.4.4 Radiated test
The two-channel method is covering the radiated part of the test where the
performance of the UE\'s antenna subsystem is evaluated. It is using two probe
antennas and one azimuth positioner in order to cover a large number of
different angle-of-arrival constellations. In each constellation also the
polarizations of the two probe antennas are defined.
For an RX MIMO measurement (TM2 or TM3), the two signals from the base station
emulator are routed directly to the probe antennas with the chosen
polarization.
In order to assess the radiated performance of the MIMO antenna system in 3D,
the UE shall be tested for a set of antenna constellations uniformly covering
the sphere and generating a wide variety of AoAs. In the radiated test the
constellations are categorized as spatial constellations, i.e, the azimuth
orientation of the UE and the elevation positions of the two DL antennas and
as polarization constellations, i.e., the set of polarizations of the DL
antennas used to transmit the LTE MIMO streams. Figure 6.3.1.4.4-1 highlights
the key parameters for each constellation category.
\ (a)\ \ \ (b)
Figure 6.3.1.4.4-1: Overview of (a) spatial and (b) polarization
constellations
An optimized constellation approach determines a set of constellations.\ The
algorithm used has been written specifically for the decomposition approach.\
A total of 128 constellations have been identified to be sufficient in order
to sample the antenna performance.
For each constellation, a curve of throughput as a function of DL power level
or SNR is recorded.\ At the end of the test, i.e., 128 constellations, an
average of all curves is determined that represents the FOM for the MIMO
antenna subsystem performance for a complete set of 3D AoAs.
##### 6.3.1.4.5 Possible extensions of the decomposition method
There are several possible extensions of the method briefly addressed in this
Clause.
• The channel information available in the UE can be used to deliver a quick
answer to the test system about the current receive quality. If necessary, an
explicit scaling from one quantity onto the other one can be made.
• In case of an RX diversity measurement the signal from the base station
emulator has to be routed via a two-channel fading to the two probe antennas
in the chamber in order to decorrelate the signals.
• In addition of the movements of the probe antennas and the azimuth
positioner, the UE may be tilted by some additional rotation around the
horizontal axis.
• As a special case it is also possible to test with one antenna where each
polarization is transmitting one MIMO data stream.
• As an alternative to moving the antennas by mechanically rotating them it is
possible to arrange the antennas in a horizontal plane and to move one antenna
with respect to the other in order to vary the angle difference between the
two. In that case the positioner rotating the UE will be designed in a more
complex way.
• If one wants to extend this method to 3D AoA, a third antenna outside the
plane can be used.
The OTA performance can better be described by taking statistical evaluations
into account. If, for example, for each test point a relative throughput value
is obtained as function of subcarrier power, one can plot the results for
different points in a histogram and to obtain some CCDF indicating the
conditions for getting at least a given throughput value.
#### 6.3.1.5 Candidate solution 5
The RF-controlled spatial fading emulator can directly reproduce a multipath
radio propagation environment by radio waves emitted from antenna-probe units
arranged around a handset tested. Moreover, the emulator has an advantage of
measuring radiation characteristics of a handset antenna for the present OTA
testing in 3GPP as well as the multipath testing because of its RF operation
[6].
##### 6.3.1.5.1 Concept and configuration
The RF-controlled spatial fading emulator can directly reproduce multipath
radio propagation environments both in Line-Of-Sight (LOS) and Non Line-Of-
Sight (NLOS) situations by radio waves emitted from antenna probes arranged
around a DUT. Thus, the emulator can be easily used for measurement of the
MIMO characteristics of a HSPA/LTE multiple antenna device in a multipath
fading environment.
Figure 6.3.1.5.1-1 (a) and (b) show the configuration and arrangement of the
antenna probes of the RF spatial fading emulator in an anechoic chamber. In
this method, the DUT is designated as any device that possesses multiple
antennas, including a HSPA or LTE device.
The height of DUT from the floor of the anechoic chamber is **_H_**. The DUT
can also be placed at a rotatable turn-table in order to set and vary the
horizontal angle of the DUT. The DUT is surrounded by **_N_** numbers of
antenna probes.\ The distance between DUT and each antenna probe is **_r_**.
The antenna probe consists of two antennas.\ The one is a half-wavelength
dipole set vertically for emitting the vertically-polarized wave and the other
is a horizontally-located half-wavelength dipole for the horizontally-
polarized wave. This configuration of the antenna-probe unit can represent a
cross polarization power ratio, XPR, of incoming wave. The separation between
vertical and horizontal antennas is **_d_**. The height of the antenna probe
from the anechoic chamber floor is **_h_**. The distance between the ring of
antenna probes and the walls of anechoic chamber is **_D_**. (Note if the
anechoic chamber is not square, then **_D~1~_** and **_D~2~_** are used).
A reference antenna probe is designated so that it can be used to determine
the direction of motion of DUT.\ This parameter is designated as
$\varphi_{\text{shift}}$. The circular angle between antenna probes from the
centre of the ring (i.e. DUT) is $\varphi_{i}$ with respect to the reference
antenna probe.

Figure 6.3.1.5.1-1: Experimental setup of the spatial fading emulator
The key features of this method are that it does not use the sophisticated
commercial channel emulator.\ By using the combination of phase shifters,
power dividers and attenuators, operating in the RF band, it has been shown
that a realistic fading channel environment can be emulated. To reduce the
influence from the measurement equipment, the receiver, phase shifter, power
divider, transmitter and computer are set outside of the anechoic chamber.\
Firstly, we describe channel response between the _m_ ^th^ base station, BS,
antenna and the _n_ ^th^ handset antenna for _M_ -by-_N_ MIMO radio
communication system. The channel response is calculated by following
equation:
$h_{\text{nm}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{E_{n}\left( \varphi_{i}
\right)\sqrt{\Omega\left( \varphi_{i} \right)}}\frac{\lambda}{4\pi \cdot
r}\text{exp}\left\lbrack - j\left{ \text{kr} + 2\pi \cdot t \cdot
f_{D}\text{cos}(\varphi_{0} - \varphi_{i}) + \alpha_{\text{mi}} \right}
\right\rbrack$ (1)
where _E~n~_ and _f~D~_ are radiation component of the _n_ -th handset antenna
and the Doppler frequency respectively. _φ~0~_ is the direction of motion and
_φ_ ~i~ is the direction of the _i_ -th antenna probe. _α~mi~_ is initial
phase of the signal radiated from the _i_ -th antenna probe. The waves
radiated from each base station (BS) antenna are uncorrelated each other.\ For
the investigation of MIMO antennas, the waves from different BS antenna are
represented by different sets of initial phases, _α~mi~_ , of the waves.
According to the propagation models, such as SCM and SCME, the angular power
spectrum _Ω_ of the spatial cluster of incoming waves in the horizontal plane
can be modelled by a Laplacian distribution in the following, for instance:
$\Omega\left( \varphi \right) = \frac{P}{2\sigma}\text{exp}\left{ -
\frac{\left| \varphi - \mu_{\varphi} \right|}{\sigma} \right}$ (2)
where _P_ and _μ~φ~_ are power and average direction of angle of the cluster.
_σ_ is a standard deviation of the APS. In this case, the spatial distribution
in the vertical plane is modelled by a delta function.
In addition, the strongest point of the spatial fading emulator is to be
capable of evaluating radiation characteristics of a handset antenna for the
present OTA testing in 3GPP as well as the multipath-fading evaluation since
the emulator is operated in a Radio Frequency (RF) band.
A calibration of the RF-controlled spatial fading emulator is carried out
using the following procedure:
1) Firstly a half-wavelength dipole for the receiving antenna is vertically
placed at the center of a circle arranging the antenna probes.
2) A radio wave with vertical polarization is radiated only from a vertical
dipole of the antenna probe #i (i=1, 2, ..., L), and then, the dipole at the
center of the emulator can receive the wave. From this, we can obtain
amplitude and phase of the RF signal from the transmitter to the receiver via
the vertical dipole of the antenna probe #i.
3) The attenuator and phase shifter are adjusted so that the RF signals
received by the dipole at the center have the same values in amplitude and
phase.
4) Secondly the slotted cylindrical antenna is placed at the center of the
antenna probes located on the circle.
5) A radio wave with horizontal polarization is radiated only from a
horizontally-located dipole of the antenna probe #i (i=1, 2, ..., L). From the
received signal from the antenna probe #i, we also obtain amplitude and phase
of the RF signal from the transmitter to the receiver via the horizontal
dipole of the antenna probe #i.
6) The attenuator and phase shifter are adjusted so that the RF signals
received by the slotted cylindrical antenna at the center have the same values
in amplitude and phase.
The calibration procedure above mentioned can be performed by using an
electrical-controlled RF switch.\ Thus, the calibration of the emulator can be
done automatically using a computer in our system. Once the calibration is
finished, we can vary the attenuators in order to produce a special
distribution of the incoming wave and to make a Cross polarization Power Ratio
(XPR). Moreover, we can set an initial phase to each antenna probe to create a
multipath fading channel.
With regard to the signal-to-noise power ratio, SNR, of incoming wave, the
signal power can be determined by an average value of faded signal powers
received by a half-wavelength dipole antenna for the vertical polarization and
a slotted cylindrical antenna for the horizontal polarization. Both antennas
have an omni-directional radiation pattern. Thus, SNR can be obtained as the
following equation:
$\text{SNR} = \frac{S_{V} + S_{H}}{N_{0}}$ (3)
where _S~V~_ and _S~H~_ are the average signal powers received by the dipole
and slotted cylindrical antennas, respectively.\ _N~0~_ is the noise power
that was calculated as a thermal noise within the frequency bandwidth of the
radio communication.
##### 6.3.1.5.2 Test conditions
In this method, all signals are operated and controlled at RF level. A
computer (either a laptop or relatively powerful computer) is used to provide
the followings:
1) Graphical User Interface (GUI) to set the input parameters, determine the
measured parameters to be collected, setting of calibration parameters and
setting of DUT parameters.
2) Generating control signals to manipulate the phase angle of each Phase
Shifter.
3) Collecting measured raw data obtained via the DUT.
4) Post-processing the measured raw data to derive the desired figure of
merits (i.e. minimum requirements for DUT).
5) To initiate the BS emulator and start the testing session (by establishing
a communication session with DUT).
The RF signals transmitted from the BS emulator\'s antenna connector are fed
to a bank of Power Dividers.\ Each power divider provides identical RF signal
from each of the output ports.\ The number of Power Dividers required is
determined by **_N_**.
Each Power Divider output is then fed to a Phase Shifter. The Phase Shifter is
used to change the phase of the RF signal according to the parameter setting
input to the computer earlier. Note that the control signal from the computer
is digital-to-analogue, D/A, converted, before used to control the Phase
Shifter. By controlling the phase of each RF signal, a Rayleigh distributed or
other relevant multipath distribution can be obtained.\ The number of Phase
Shifters required is determined by **_N_**.
The output of the Phase Shifters is connected to the antenna probes. The
signal from each Phase Shifter is fed to the vertical and horizontal antennas
and radiates toward the DUT. The DUT then measures the signals from each
antenna probe and the measurement data is reported back to the computer. The
amount of measurement data to be collected can be controlled by the computer
by setting the sampling rate, **_R_**.
An example below illustrated the principle of creating Rayleigh faded signal
by control the phase of each component wave in Figure 6.3.1.5.2-1.

### 6.3.2 Methodologies based on Reverberation Chamber
#### 6.3.2.1 Candidate solution 1
The Reverberation Chamber is a metallic cavity or cavities that can emulate an
isotropic multi-path environment which represents a reference environment for
systems designed to work during fading, similar to how the free space
\"anechoic\" reference environment is used for tests of Line-Of-Sight systems.
The Rayleigh environment in a reverberation chamber is well known as a good
reference for urban and indoor environments, but does not well represent rural
and suburban environments.
For a future multi-antenna OTA measurement standard it is important to have a
fast and repeatable test method to evaluate and compare multi-antenna devices
in the environments and under the conditions where most people will use them.
The overwhelming majority of calls/data connections with mobile phones are
made indoors and in urban areas which can be very well represented by the
reverberation chamber. These environments are well characterised by multi-path
and 3D distribution of the communication signals and it makes sense to use the
reverberation chamber for optimizing/evaluating devices with both single and
multiple antenna configurations to be used indoors and in urban areas.
The test setup for testing UE receiver diversity performance is composed of a
Base Station (BS) emulator, a reverberation chamber equipped with fixed BS
wall-mounted antennas, a switch to direct the base station signal to/from one
of the BS wall mounted antennas, mechanical metallic stirrers and a rotating
platform to hold the DUT (Figure 6.3.2.1-1).\ Alternatively, the chamber may
contain one or more cavities coupled through waveguides or slotted plates
(Figure 7.1-2).
Reverberation chambers have no quiet zone. As long as the DUT is placed at
least 0.5 wavelengths from the wall or metallic stirrers the result will be
the same within the standard deviation of the chamber.
Mechanical stirrers and switching among different fixed BS wall-mounted
antennas (monopoles used for polarization stirring) allow simulating the
Rayleigh fading at each antenna of the terminal inside the chamber. Accuracy
can even been increased by rotating the platform holding the device.
Each position of the mechanical stirrers for each position of the platform and
each fixed BS antenna, represents a point of the Rayleigh distribution in
terms of receive power on the device antennas. In that way a Rayleigh fading
is artificially created.
In that way, several UE metrics can be measured: throughput with RX-DIV, TRP,
TIS (Total Isotropic Sensitivity), etc.
For each point of the Rayleigh distribution created by the different
configurations of the chamber, the metric is noted. This method can be used to
measure UE sensitivity and UE radiated power.

This measurement checks the Doppler/temporal correlation.
**Method of measurement:**
Sine wave (CW, carrier wave) signal is transmitted from the signal generator.
The signal is connected from the signal generator to fading emulator via
cables. The fading emulator output signals are connected to power amplifier
boxes via cables. The amplified signals are then transferred via cables to the
probe antennas. The probe antennas radiate the signals over the air to the
test antenna The Doppler spectrum is measured by the spectrum analyzer and the
trace is saved.

**Method of Measurement Results Analysis**
Calculate correlation of 1000 x 11 matrix **H**(_f_) of frequency response
samples. The procedure is to correlate sixth column (the trace measured at the
centre of chamber) with the 10 other columns as follows (Matlab example)
> for ind = 1:11;
>
> Corr(: , : , ind) = abs(corrcoef(**H**(: , 1),**H**(: , ind)));
>
> end
>
> Correlation = squeeze(Corr(1, 2, :));
The reference spatial correlation plots from Table 8.2-1 and 8.2-2 are shown
in Figure 8.3.2.3-2.

**Measurement Procedure**
1\. Play or step through the channel model -> SCME UMi, or UMa X Corr.
2\. Measure the absolute power received at the center of the array, averaged
over a statistically significant number of fades.
a. Use a vertically polarized sleeve dipole to measure the V component.
b. Use a horizontally polarized (vertically oriented) magnetic loop dipole, or
a horizontally polarized sleeve dipole measured in two orthogonal horizontal
positions and summed to measure the H component.
3\. Calculate the V/H ratio.
4\. Compare it with the theory -> 0.83dB for UMi, and 8.13dB for UMa.
**Expected measurement results**
V/H ratio (composite, i.e. all 6 paths combined) of the 3GPP SCME Umicro model
is 0.83 dB and for Umacro 8.13 dB.\ The BS antennas are isotropic dipoles with
+/- 45 degrees slant and subject to a foreshortening of the slanted radiating
element. See channel model details specified in clause 8.2.

## 8.5 Channel Model emulation of the Base Station antenna pattern
configuration
Editor\'s Note: To include the agreed X-polarized method. Any additional
approach would need to be clearly specified.
The emulated BS antennas shall be assumed to be dual polarized equal power
elements with a fixed 0λ separation, 45 degrees slanted.
The slant 45 degree antenna is an \"X\" configuration and is modelled as an
ideal dipole with isotropic gain and subject to a foreshortening of the
slanted radiating element, which is observed to vary as a function of the path
angle of departure. This foreshortening with AoD is a typical slanted dipole
behaviour and is a source of power variation in the channel model. The
effective antenna pattern for this antenna is illustrated in Figure 8.5-1.

### 9.3.1 The Absolute Data Throughput Comparison Framework
#### 9.3.1.1 Introduction
In an effort to compare different MIMO OTA methodologies\' results to
conducted results under the implementations of channel models defined in
clause 8.2, the absolute data throughput comparison framework has been
defined.\ By utilizing the reference antennas (clause 9.1) and reference
devices (clause 9.2), this framework shall be used to compare each MIMO OTA
testing method\'s ability to emulate the specified network and channel
propagation characteristics based on an absolute data throughput metric.
The framework consists of a set of conducted (Figure 9.3.1.1-1) and radiated
(Figure 9.3.1.1-2) measurements of MIMO throughput (clause 5.1.1). The details
for the application of this framework are described in clause 9.3.1.6.

#### 9.3.1.2 Antenna pattern data format
The antenna pattern data format---used in the conducted portion of the
measurements --- shall be in the 3D AAU format as defined by COST IC1004 [14].

The file name format shall be defined as \"(lab acronym)_(antenna serial
number)_CTIA_MIMO 2x2_Band(B7, B13..Bxx)_(Good, Nominal, or Bad)_Ant(1 or
2).3daau\".
Based on experiments taken with low (\1.8GHz) frequency band
antennas, the magnitude of the complex correlation coefficient generated from
measured data remains unchanged from higher resolution antenna pattern
measurements up to 15 degrees resolution in theta and phi orientations. To
align with current COST IC1004 TWGO MIMO OTA topic group proposed resolution
for 3D MIMO OTA complex radiation pattern measurements, the antenna pattern
measurement step size in theta and phi shall be no more than 5 degrees. In the
specific case of 2D measurements theta is fixed at 90 degrees.
#### 9.3.1.3 Emulation of antenna pattern rotation
For the conducted portion of the absolute data throughput framework, it is
necessary to generate the spatially filtered channel impulse response per
polarization and then combine to generate the emulated channel impulse
response coefficients. The measured antenna pattern shall be interpolated to
match the spatial resolution of the angles of arrival of the SCME channel
emulator (this value is typically 1 degrees). Figure 9.3.1.3-1 below
illustrates an example of this procedure using a simplified antenna pattern
and channel PAS.
{width="4.820138888888889in" height="2.7423611111111112in"}
Figure 9.3.1.3-1: Rotation of antenna pattern over azimuth positions
In general, the emulation of antenna pattern rotation is specific to the
channel model. For 2D channel models antenna pattern rotation shall be
performed over 360 degrees in 30 degree steps (12 total positions). For other
channel models this process is FFS.
A spatial filtering operation alone does not capture the behaviour of the 2D
channel model as a function of DUT rotation. Figure 9.3.1.3-2 below
illustrates the geometric parameters of the 2D channel model [15] for two DUT
rotations.
a){width="5.1715277777777775in" height="1.979861111111111in"}
b) {width="5.157638888888889in" height="2.089583333333333in"}
Figure 9.3.1.3-2: (a) 2D channel model geometric parameters for MS array
direction = 0 degrees;\ (b) MS array direction = 60 degrees
For a given rotation of the DUT, the angle of the MS array relative to the
cluster angles of arrival changes. Thus, MS array rotation together with the
spatial filtering operations described above is necessary to emulate the
conducted portion of the framework properly. Doppler spread, which is a
function of the MS direction of travel relative to the channel model
clusters\' angles of arrival, shall remain the same for all rotations of the
DUT.
Calculation of the required spatial filtering operations as a function of DUT
orientation for channel emulators using a geometric implementation is self-
evident from Figures 9.3.1.3-1 and 9.3.1.3-2. For channel emulators
implementing the alternative correlation-based approach, the same spatial
filtering operations are carried out by computing the correlation matrix and
power imbalance for the specific channel model used and then applying the
calculated correlation matrix and power in the channel emulation. The detail
for how this is done is considered implementation specific and is not
elaborated further here. It is noted that the correlation implementation
results in a Doppler spectrum and corresponding temporal correlation that is
independent of DUT orientation.
This process may be automated with channel emulator control software or
performed manually. The output data format is described in clause 9.3.1.5.
#### 9.3.1.4 Absolute Data Throughput measurement enabler
The fundamental enabler for the adoption of the Absolute Data Throughput
metric is the ability to apply the complex radiation pattern to the channel
for the conducted portion of the test. Such conducted measurements can be
performed manually; however, without an application (SW) to rotate the loaded
antenna complex radiation pattern, the measurement may become very time
consuming and prone to human errors. Automation of this process is highly
recommended.
#### 9.3.1.5 Output data format
A unified data format for recording the conducted and radiated test results by
each lab is defined in Tables 9.3.1.5-1 and 9.3.1.5-2 below.

#### 9.3.1.6 Application of the framework and scenarios for comparison
This framework is methodology agnostic, and shall be used to compare each MIMO
OTA testing method\'s ability to emulate the specified network and channel
propagation characteristics based on an absolute data throughput metric
(Clause 5.1.1).
The purposes of this framework are:
\- For the agreed Channel Models, currently SCME Umi and Uma, to understand
and quantify what are the deviations (if any) introduced by the chamber used
in radiated mode compared to the conducted mode (when reference antennas are
embedded). This shall be applied inter labs for the same method and inter
methods.
\- For methods that are able to reproduce channel models that are not agreed
in the present document, it can be used to define the channel model details
that need to be injected in the conducted test to obtain same results in the
radiated part. And therefore it is easier to reproduce those conditions across
methods.
The above use cases for the framework are required to be conducted for inter
methodology comparison.\ Other applications for the framework are optional and
not excluded.
And more concretely, the following scenarios for comparison are defined:
Figure 9.3.1.6-1: Application of the framework and scenarios for comparison
These scenarios are intended to address the following aspects:
1\. **The first scenario** , anechoic based: intended to compare the conducted
portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas) with the same
results of the radiated test.\ Throughputs are compared to understand any
artifacts introduced by the setup.
2\. **The second scenario** , reverberation based: intended to compare the
conducted portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas) with
the same results of the radiated test.\ Throughputs are compared to understand
any artifacts introduced by the setup.
3\. **The third scenario** , reverberation based: intended to compare the
conducted portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas) and
with 3D isotropic channel model with the same results of the radiated test.\
Throughputs are compared to understand any artifacts introduced by the setup.\
Additionally this scenario will help to define the 3D isotropic properties of
the channel model as perceived by the UE in the reverb chamber, and compare
its realization in the conducted portion.
NOTE: If scenario2 holds true, it would mean that for the agreed setup
anechoic method and reverberation method provides comparable results for the
agreed channel models in the present document, currently 2D SCME.

depends on the specification of a UE antenna measurement function which is not
part of the present study item.
#### 12.3.4.2 Configuration
The concept and configuration of the test setup is given in Clause 6.3.1.3.
#### 12.3.4.3 Calibration
The calibration procedure is specific to the test concept and configuration,
therefore is unique for each implementation. The calibration procedure shall
be documented by each lab, with enough details to allow third party
verification. Examples are given in Annex F.
### 12.3.5 Figure of Merit {#figure-of-merit-2 .list-paragraph}
The performance metric is given in Clause 5.
### 12.3.6 Test procedure {#test-procedure-4 .list-paragraph}
#### 12.3.6.1 Initial conditions
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE shall be tested in
and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the correct measurement
state for each test case.
1\. Ensure environmental requirements of Annex A are met.
2\. Configure the test system according to Clauses 12.3.1 and 12.3.2 for the
applicable test case.
3\. Verify the implementation of the channel model as specified in Clause
12.3.2.
NOTE: The verification of the channel model implementation can be part of the
laboratory accreditation process i.e. performed once for each channel model,
and will remain valid as long as the setup and instruments remain unchanged.
Otherwise the channel model validation may need to be performed prior to
starting each throughput test.
4\. Position the UE in the chamber according to Clause 12.3.3.
5\. Power on the UE.
6\. Set up the connection.
#### 12.3.6.2 Test procedure
The following steps shall be followed in order to evaluate MIMO OTA
performance of the DUT:
1\. Generate a test signal by the SS. The SS transmits the signal through the
test system to the DUT.
2\. Use the antenna patterns retrieved in stage 1 described in Clause 6.3.1.3
in order to configure the test channel model, then play the channel emulator
and do throughput test.
3\. Record the throughput for each DUT orientation controlled by the channel
emulator and each RS EPRE level.
4\. Identify and report the RS EPRE level achieving 70% throughput for
averaged throughput.
NOTE 1: The initial RS EPRE can be set to the user\'s freely selectable
level.\ Recommended initial RS EPRE is found in Tables 7.1-1 and 7.1-2.
NOTE 2: To meet the throughput value target DL RS EPRE level can be changed
using user\'s freely selectable algorithm.
### 12.3.7 Measurement Uncertainty budget {#measurement-uncertainty-budget-2
.list-paragraph}
The measurement uncertainty budget for the test methodology is given in Annex
B.
## 12.4 Comparison of methodologies
The methodologies which tests plans are described Clause 12, can be broadly
classified into 3 categories:
1) Reverberation Chamber (RC);
2) Anechoic Chamber (AC);
3) Multi-stage Method.
The content of the Table 12.4-1 is based on what has been validated as well as
currently available state-of-the-art information, and may be reconsidered when
the state of the art technology progresses.

###### ### Annex A: eNodeB Emulator Downlink power verification
# A.1 Introduction
The measurements described in this clause serve three primary purposes; to
confirm that:
1) the PDSCH total power is balanced between the MIMO transmit ports of an
eNodeB emulator;
2) the PDCCH-EPRE vs. PDSCH-EPRE is balanced per eNodeB emulator antenna port
within a given RB;
3) the RS-EPRE vs. PDSCH-EPRE ratio is correct per eNodeB emulator antenna
port within a given RB.
# A.2 Test prerequisites
The parameters specified in Table A.1-1 and Table A.1-2 below are based on the

# A.3 Test Methodology
For the purpose of verifying channel power levels called for in this document,
the eNodeB emulator shall be connected to a test UE (DUT) according to the
configuration shown in Figure A.3-1 below:
{width="6.01875in" height="3.720833333333333in"}
NOTE 1: TX Port #1 is used as transmit-only on eNodeB emulators with a
separate uplink RX port.
NOTE 2: If the eNodeB emulator supports full duplex operation on TX port #1,
the circulator\'s RX port shall be terminated in a 50 Ohm load.
NOTE 3: These splitter ports will be used to provide a downlink RF sample to
the analyzer and shall be terminated in a 50 Ohm load when not in use.
Figure A.3-1: eNodeB Connections for Downlink Power Verification
The analyzer shown in Figure A.3-1 above must be capable of measuring the
eNodeB emulator\'s average PDCCH power independent of the eNodeB emulator\'s
average PDSCH power, expressed as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz.\ The analyzer must also
be capable of measuring RS EPRE and PDSCH EPRE in dBm/15 kHz.\ Any instrument
capable of making these measurements is acceptable.
**The following eight measurements shall be made while the UE is in an active
data session and sending continuous uplink data to the eNodeB emulator using
the settings described in Table A.1-1 and Table A.1-2:**
1) Average power at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) of all PDCCH RBs expressed
as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz
2) Average power at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) of all PDSCH RBs expressed
as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz
3) PDSCH-EPRE at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) in dBm/15 kHz
4) RS-EPRE at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) in dBm/15 kHz for the Reference
Signals in DL
5) Average power at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) of all PDCCH RBs expressed
as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz
6) Average power at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) of all PDSCH RBs expressed
as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz
7) PDSCH-EPRE at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) in dBm/15 kHz
8) RS-EPRE at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) in dBm/15 kHz
**From the eight measurements described above, calculate the following:**
● eNodeB TX Port 1/TX Port 2 PDCCH average power balance (in dB) across all DL
RBs
● eNodeB TX Port 1/TX Port 2 PDSCH average power balance (in dB) across all DL
RBs
● eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE power ratio (in dB), TX Port 1
● eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE power ratio (in dB), TX Port 2
**To be considered compliant with 3GPP TS 36.521-1** [12]**, the following
criteria must be met:**
a. eNodeB PDCCH-EPRE TX Port1/TX Port 2 power balance must be\ 0 dB, +/- 0.7
dB
b. eNodeB PDSCH-EPRE TX Port 1/TX Port 2 power balance must be\ 0 dB, +/- 0.7
dB
c. eNodeB PDCCH-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE TX Port 1 power ratio must be\ 0 dB, +/-
0.7 dB
d. eNodeB PDCCH-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE TX Port 2 power ratio must be\ 0 dB, +/-
0.7 dB
**In addition, the following criteria must be met per antenna based on the**
PDSCH EPRE power offset relative to\ RS EPRE called for in Table A.1-1 **and
Table A.1-2:**
e. eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE ratio must be +3 dB, +/- 0.7 dB\ for TX Port 1
f. eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE ratio must be +3 dB, +/- 0.7 dB\ for TX Port 2

###### ### Annex C: Other Environmental Test conditions for consideration
# C.1 Scope
**This annex contains non standard channel models which are described for
evaluation purposes.\ Approved channel models are described in Clause 4.2.**
# C.2 3D isotropic Channel Models
This clause proposes three 3D isotropic channel models. One of the models is
based on the NIST channel model and two of the models are based on the
temporal aspects and Base Station (BS) correlation properties of the SCME UMi
and SCME UMa channel models.
The proposed 3D isotropic channel models are not directly based on real life
operating conditions, rather, are an attempt to model the properties of the
reverberation chamber which has been shown to represent a statistically
isotropic environment provided sufficient averaging is performed using mode
stirring. The instantaneous conditions within the reverberation chamber are
not isotropic.
The following 3D isotropic model is based on the PDP and BS correlation of the
SCME Urban Micro-cell model with isotropic AoAs and modified XPR values and
Velocity.

The parameters of the channel models are the expected parameters for the MIMO
OTA channel models.\ However, the final channel model achieved for different
methods could be a combined effect of the chamber and the channel emulator.
The Rayleigh fading may be implementation specific. However, the fading can be
considered to be appropriate as long as the statistics of the generated
Rayleigh fading are within standard requirement on Rayleigh fading statistics.
# C.3 Verification of Channel Model implementations
Channel Models have been specified in Clause C.2.\ This clause describes the
MIMO OTA validation measurements, in order to ensure that the channel models
are correctly implemented and hence capable of generating the propagation
environment, as described by the model, within a test area. Measurements are
done mainly with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and a spectrum analyzer.
## C.3.1 Measurement instruments and setup
The measurement setup includes the following equipment:

### C.3.1.1 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) setup
Most of the measurements are performed with a VNA. An example set of equipment
required for this set-up is shown in Figure C.3.1.1-1. VNA transmits frequency
sweep signals thorough the MIMO OTA test system.\ A test antenna, within the
test area, receives the signal and VNA analyzes the frequency response of the
system.\ A number of traces (frequency responses) are measured and recorded by
VNA and analyzed by a post processing SW, e.g., Matlab. Special care has to be
taken into account to keep the fading conditions unchanged, i.e. frozen,
during the short period of time of a single trace measurement. The fading may
proceed only in between traces. This setup can be used to measure PDP, Spatial
Correlation and Polarization of the Channel models defined in Clause C.2.

### C.3.1.2 Spectrum Analyzer (SA) setup
The Doppler spectrum is measured with a Spectrum Analyzer as shown in Figure
C.3.1.2-1. In this case a Signal generator transmits CW signal through the
MIMO OTA test system. The signal is received by a test antenna within the test
area. Finally the signal is analyzed by a Spectrum Analyzer and the measured
spectrum is compared to the target spectrum. This setup can be used to measure
Doppler Spectrum of the Channel models defined in Clause C.2.

## C.3.2 Validation measurements
### C.3.2.1 Power Delay Profile (PDP)
This measurement checks that the resulting Power Delay Profile (PDP) is like
defined in the channel model.
**Method of measurement:**
Step the emulation and store traces from VNA. I.e. run the emulation to CIR
number 1, pause, measure VNA trace, run the emulation to CIR number 10, pause,
measure VNA trace. Continue until 1000 VNA traces are measured.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**
Measured VNA traces (frequency responses H(t,f)) are saved into a hard drive.
The data is read into, e.g., Matlab.\ The analysis is performed by taking the
Fourier transform of each FR.\ The resulting impulse responses h(t, _τ_) are
averaged in power over time:
Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay, such that the first tap is on
delay zero.\ The reference PDP plots from Table C.2-1, Table C.2-2 and Table
C.2-3 are shown in Figure C.3.2.1-1.
In a reverberation chamber, when a channel emulator is not used and the PDP is
therefore an exponential decay, such as the NIST channel model, only the
inherent RMS Delay Spread of the reverberation chamber needs to be
calculated.\ The selection of the T _h~i~(t,τ)_ measurements has to be
performed when the absorber loading technique is used to tune the RMS DS in an
RC. Alternatively, the sample selection technique allows for selecting a
subset of M _h~i~(t,τ)_ measurements which provide the desired RMS DS, and in
this case the averaging has to be performed only over the selected subset of M
channel impulse responses.
The calculation of RMS delay spread is performed on the time domain data as
the square root of the second central moment of the PDP, that is:
The expected RMS delay spread for the NIST channel model is 80 ns.

configuration) of V polarized elements **or fixed measurement source

### C.3.2.2 Doppler for 3D isotropic models
This measurement checks the Doppler.**Method of measurement:**
For Doppler validation, two methods could be used to measure the Doppler
spectrum. The first uses a CW tone from the Signal Generator fed directly, or
via the channel emulator if used, to the fixed measurement antennas and is
recorded by the spectrum analyzer. For the second method, the input signal
from the VNA is fed directly, or via the channel emulator if used, to the
fixed measurement antennas of the chamber.
For the first method, a sine wave (CW, carrier wave) signal is transmitted
from the signal generator. The signal is connected from the signal generator
to the channel emulator via cables. The channel emulator output signals are
connected to power amplifier boxes via cables. The amplified signals are then
transferred via cables to the fixed measurement antennas. The fixed
measurement antennas radiate the signals over the air to the test antenna. The
Doppler spectrum is measured by the spectrum analyzer and the trace is saved.
Alternatively, the Doppler spectrum can be measured with a VNA. Frequency
sweeps are measured with the VNA for a complete stirring sequence, thus
collecting samples of the chamber transfer function $H(f,s_{n})$ for each
fixed stirrer position $s_{n}$. To get a correct estimate of the Doppler power
spectrum, the spatial distance between the stirrer positions should be small
enough to satisfy Nyquist theorem. $H(f,s_{n})$ is Fourier transformed
according to
The Doppler spectrum $D(f,\rho)$ can then be calculated using
The discrete Doppler power spectrum will now have a frequency axis ranging
from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of stirrer positions used. To convert
this into a Doppler frequency domain, the sampling theorem gives a frequency
axis in the interval [$- \rho_{\text{max}}$,$\rho_{\text{max}}$], where
and the frequency step between each Doppler frequency sample is given by
$\text{Δt}$ is the time step between the measured samples.

### C.3.2.3 Base Station antenna correlation for 3D isotropic models
This measurement checks that the resulting Base Station (BS) antenna
correlation follows the computed values from the channel parameters given in
tables C.2-1, C.2-2 and C.2-3.
**Method of measurement:**
For correlation validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed directly (for
table C.2.-3), or via the channel emulator (for tables C.2-1 and C.2-2), to
the fixed measurement antennas of the reverberation chamber.
Step the emulation and stirrer sequence and store traces from the VNA. I.e.
run the emulation Channel Impulse Response (CIR) number 1with the
reverberation chamber\'s stirrer sequence fixed at a point, pause, measure VNA
trace, run the emulation to the next CIR and move the reverberation chamber\'s
stirrer sequence to the next point, pause, measure VNA trace. Continue until
all VNA traces are measured.

### C.3.2.4 Rayleigh fading
This measurement checks that the resulting fading of the MIMO OTA system is
Rayleigh as per the channel model.**Method of measurement:** For Rayleigh
Fading validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed directly, or via the
channel emulator, to the fixed measurement transmit antennas of the
reverberation chamber.
Step the emulation and stirrer sequence and store traces from VNA. i.e. run
the emulation to CIR number 1 with the reverberation chamber\'s stirrer
sequence fixed at a point, pause, measure VNA trace, run the emulation to next
CIR and move the reverberation chamber\'s stirrer sequence to the next point,
pause, measure VNA trace. Continue until all VNA traces are measured.

**Method of Measurement Results Analysis**
The primary performance criteria to evaluate Rayleigh fading is the Cumulative
Probability Density Function (CPDF) of the received signal amplitude (x) at
the DUT. CPDF describes the probability of a signal level being less than the
mean level. The CPDF of x in a set of measured samples (or a selected subset)
in a mode-stirred reverberation chamber [FC(x)] is defined as:
The evaluation of the measured CPDF has to provide:
1) The difference (dB) to theoretical Rayleigh-fading values for power levels
ranging from 10dB above to 20 dB below the mean power level.
2) The differences (dB) to theoretical Rayleigh-fading values for power levels
ranging from 20 dB below to 30 dB below the mean power level.
The requirement for CPDF is:
1) The tolerance shall be within [TBD] dB of theoretical Rayleigh-fading, for
power levels from 10 dB above to 20 dB below the mean power level.
2) The tolerance shall be within [TBD] dB of theoretical Rayleigh-fading, for
power levels from 20 dB below to 30 dB below the mean power level.

### C.3.2.5 Isotropy for 3D isotropic models
This measurement checks that MIMO OTA system provides an isotropic environment
over time.
**Method of measurement:**
For isotropic validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed directly, or
via the channel emulator, to the fixed measurement antennas of the
reverberation chamber. If a channel emulator is used, it has to be placed in
Bypass mode where no fading is used. Instead of the test antenna, an electric
dipole is placed on the turn table.\ Three orthogonal components of the
electric field are recorded with the dipole in three different orientations\
(see Figure C.3.1.1-2 and Figure C.3.1.1-3).
Step the stirrer sequence and store traces from VNA. i.e. with the
reverberation chamber\'s stirrer sequence fixed at a point, pause, measure a
VNA trace for each wall antenna, move the reverberation chamber\'s stirrer
sequence to the next fixed point, pause, measure VNA trace for each wall
antenna. Continue until all VNA traces are measured. Follow this procedure
with the dipole in all three positions.

The Data Mode Portrait (DMP) conditions are defined in TR 25.914 [11], and are
included in this table for completeness. The Data Mode Landscape (DML) testing
conditions are not currently defined in any standard testing methodology but
benefit from a thorough treatment in academic literature [18]. This testing
condition considers free space for all handset sizes until a DML phantom
design becomes available, at which time the testing condition will be
revisited.
The Laptop Mounted Equipment (LME) and Laptop Embedded Equipment (LEE) testing
conditions are well defined in TR 25.914 [11] and constitute an XY plane cut
measurement, given the proper orientation of the lid of the laptop ground
plane phantom (in the case of LME) or of the laptop itself (in the case of
LEE).
Given a 2D ring of symmetrically distributed probes (as in Clause 6):
  * The XZ plane is similar to the DML mode except for the additional 45 degrees pitch in the DML case
  * For the phantom case the tilt of the DML case is very relevant since the interaction of the phantoms with the antennas will depend on it \-- see Figure E.2-2

###### ### Annex F: Calibration
# F.1 Scope
Here the absolute power level calibration in the center of the test zone is
described. Note that Clause 8.3 describes in detail the verification process
for the various channel models however in addition to that an absolute power
calibration needs to be performed as well. Note also that the channel model
validation and absolute power calibration may have different renewal cycles.
# F.2 Calibration Procedure -- Anechoic chamber method with multiprobe
configuration
The system needs to be calibrated in two steps in order to ensure that the
absolute power is correct. The first calibration steps ensures the accurate
generation of the channel model in the center of the chamber as required by
Clause 8.3.\ The second step validates the total power as would be seen by the
DUT and allows for that power to be scaled up or down if necessary.
Considering the complexity of the system various way to calibrate are
possible. The end goals are however the same no matter the exact procedure.
The two steps must achieve the following:
**Step 1:** This step is used to equalize the power in the center coming from
the different probes. This being a relative measurement is very robust and
with minimal uncertainty. It is sufficient to use instruments calibrated
according to the manufacturer\'s specifications and the measurements require
no additional calibration. This step is done for both vertical and horizontal
polarizations. The relative differences between probe path losses are recorded
and used (typically in the fading emulator) to adjust the generated fading
signals for each probe. Example measurement set-up is shown in Figure
8.3.1.1-1.
NOTE 1: If Step 1 is performed as an absolute measurement accounting for the
cable and reference antenna gains Step 2 can be omitted.
**Step 2:** This step is used to measure the total absolute power of at least
one polarization in the center of the ring. Then assuming that validation of
the channel models has been done, the total power available to the DUT in the
center of the chamber can be computed. If necessary the power can be scaled up
or down to achieve the desired power level. Since this is an absolute power
measurement, the measurement cable and reference antenna gains have to be
accounted for.
NOTE 2: To minimize measurement uncertainty the passive and active components
of the system may be calibrated independently as well as at different
intervals.
NOTE 3: Step 2 of the calibration should be performed with the channel model
loaded and LTE signaling active. Sufficient amount of time averaging is
required because of the fading nature of the models used.
NOTE 4: Various ways of performing the two steps may exist depending on the
equipment used.\ The lab is responsible for providing a comprehensive
calibration procedure.
NOTE 5: Steps one and two may be combined with the channel verification
procedure.
NOTE 6: The calibration must be performed for all frequencies of interest.
## F.2.1 Example Calibration Procedure
The calibration procedure outlined below is only one possibility based on a
concrete measurement set-up. Improvements can be made to minimize measurement
uncertainty.
**Step 1:**
1\. Place a vertical reference dipole in the center of the chamber, connected
to a VNA port, with the other VNA port connected to the input of the channel
emulator unit -- Figure 8.3.1.1-1.
2\. Configure the channel emulator for bypass mode (NOTE this might not be
available in all instruments)
3\. Measure the response of each path from each vertical polarization probe to
the reference antenna in the center.
4\. Adjust the power on all vertical polarization branches of the channel
emulator so that the powers received at the center are equal.
5\. Repeat the steps 1 to 4 with the magnetic loop and horizontally polarized
probes instead, and adjust the horizontal polarization branches of the channel
emulator.
NOTE: At this stage all vertical polarization paths have equalized gains, and
so do all horizontal polarization paths. The two polarizations however do not
necessarily produce the same signal strength in the center of the chamber --
this most commonly happens if two physically different channel emulators are
used for the two polarizations. The resulting power imbalance can be accounted
for either at this step or adjusted at point 7 of step 2.
**Step 2 (see Figure F.2.1-1):**
1\. Place a vertical reference dipole in the center of the chamber connected
to a spectrum analyzer via an RF cable. NOTE: A power meter can also be used.
2\. Record the cable and reference dipole gains.
3\. Load the target channel model
4\. Start the LTE signaling in the base station emulator with the required
parameter identical to the measurements conditions (some special instrument
options might be necessary).
5\. Average the power received by the spectrum analyzer for a sufficient
amount of time to account for the fading channel -- one full channel
simulation might be unnecessary.
6\. Repeat steps 1 to 4 with a magnetic loop for the horizontal polarization
(NOTE: this way no prior validation of the channel model is required)
7\. Calculate the total power received at the test area as the sum of the
power in the two polarizations.
8\. Adjust the power in the two polarizations if necessary. The power
adjustment can be a simple scaling of the power up or down or adjustment of
the XPR due to slight differences in the fading unit\'s branches. Depending on
the adjustment needed, it can be done at the base station emulator or the
channel emulator or both.

# F.3 Calibration Procedure -- Reverberation chamber method
The purpose of the calibration measurement is to determine the average power
transfer function in the chamber, mismatch of fixed measurement antennas and
path losses in cables connecting the power sampling instrument and the fixed
measurement antennas. Preferably a network analyzer is used for these
measurements. Recommended calibration antennas are dipoles tuned to the
frequency band of interest.
In general, the calibration of a reverberation chamber is performed in three
steps:
1\. Measurement of S-parameters through the reverberation chamber for a
complete stirring sequence
2\. Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
3\. Measurement of connecting cable insertion loss
If several setups are used (e.g. empty chamber, chamber with head phantom,
etc.), steps 1 and 2 must be repeated for each configuration. The calibration
measurement setup can be studied in Figure F.3-1.

Figure F.3-1: Calibration measurement setup in the reverberation chamber,
using a vector network analyzer.
## F.3.1 Measurement of S-parameters through the chamber for a complete
stirring sequence
This step will measure S-parameters through the reverberation chamber through
a complete stirring sequence. This information is required to determine the
chamber\'s reference transfer function. The procedure must be performed
separately for each measurement setup of which the loading of the chamber has
been changed. The calibration procedure must be repeated for each frequency as
defined above. Therefore, it is advantageous if the network analyzer can be
set to a frequency sweep covering the defined frequencies, so that all
frequencies of interest can be measured with a minimal number of measurement
runs.
i. Place all objects into the RC which will be used during the throughput
measurements, including a head phantom, hand phantom and fixture for the EUT.
This ensures that the loss in the chamber, which determines the average power
transfer level, is the same during both calibration and test measurements.
Also, if the EUT is large or contains many antennas, it may represent a
noticeable loading of the chamber. It should then be present in the chamber
and turned on during the calibration.
ii. Place the calibration antenna inside the chamber. The calibration antenna
is preferably mounted on a low-loss dielectric fixture, to avoid effects from
the fixture itself which may affect the EUT\'s radiation efficiency and
mismatch factor. The calibration antenna must be placed in the chamber in such
a way that it is far enough from any walls, mode-stirrers, head phantom, or
other object, such that the environment for the calibration antenna (taken
over the complete stirring sequence) resembles a free space environment. \"Far
enough away\" depends on the type of calibration antenna used. For low gain
nearly omni-directional antennas like dipoles, it is normally sufficient to
ensure that this spacing is larger than 0.5 wavelengths. More directive
calibration antennas should be situated towards the centre of the chamber. The
calibration antenna should be present in the chamber during the throughput
measurements.
iii. Calibrate the network analyzer with a full 2-port calibration in such a
way that the vector S-parameters between the ports of the fixed measurement
antenna and the calibration antenna can be accurately measured. Preferably,
the network analyzer is set to perform a frequency sweep at each stirrer
position. This will enable calibration of several frequency points during the
same stirring sequence, thereby reducing calibration time. This will also
enable frequency stirring, i.e., averaging the measured power transfer
function over a small frequency bandwidth around each measured frequency point
(moving frequency window). This will increase accuracy at the expense of
frequency resolution.
iv. Connect the antennas and measure the S-parameters for each stirrer
position and each fixed measurement antenna.
The number of stirrer positions in the chosen stirring sequence, i.e. the
number of S-parameter samples at each frequency point, should be chosen in
such a way that it is large enough to yield an acceptable statistical
contribution to the total measurement uncertainty.
## F.3.2 Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
From the S-parameters obtained in the calibration measurement, the chamber
reference transfer function for fixed antenna n can be calculated. The
reflection coefficient for fixed antenna n can be calculated as
Thus, the chamber reference transfer function can be calculated as
where M is the total number of samples of the transfer function measured for
each fixed measurement antenna and $S_{\text{21},n,m}$ is sample number m of
the transfer function for measurement antenna n. Moreover,
$\overline{S_{\text{22}}}$ is the complex average of the calibration antenna
reflection coefficient. Finally, $e_{\text{ref}}$ is the radiation efficiency
of the calibration antenna.
Note that the radiation efficiency of the fixed antenna is not corrected for,
because it will be the same both during calibration and measurements.
Therefore the fixed antenna\'s radiation efficiency will not affect the final
results. The same can be said about the mismatch factor of the fixed
measurement antennas, but it is still advantageous to correct for this factor
if frequency stirring is applied to improve accuracy.
## F.3.3 Cable calibration
This measurement step will calibrate the power loss of the cables needed to
connect the instrument to the reverberation chamber.
i. Disconnect the cables between the VNA and the chamber.
ii. Connect the cables one-by-one between the two ports of the network
analyzer. The VNA must be calibrated at its own two ports.
iii. Measure the frequency response of the transmission S-parameter ( or ) of
the cable.
iv. Save the power transfer values () of the frequency response curve for the
test frequencies. and cables positions, etc).
# F.4 Calibration Procedure: Two-stage method
For the radiated two-stage method, only the DUT reporting RSAP calibration is
to perform. Two-stage method depends on reported RSAP to do the antenna
pattern measurement, and the power calibration for radiated second-stage
throughput test. Since these reported readings do not come from a calibrated
measurement instrument, their accuracies are often subject to questioning.
Below procedure provides method for proper calibration to validate the
reported RSAP accuracy.
● DUT reporting RSAP calibration calibration:
With proper spherical coordinate definition of mobile terminal setup, the
receive antenna pattern at any coordinate (θi, ϕi) can be expressed as:
P(θi, ϕi)= RSi (1)
The test point (θi, ϕi) can be at any point on the 4π solid angle of the
coordinate. More precisely, the reported RS of the UE can be expressed as:
RSi (x)= m(x)*x+c (2)
where m(x~i~) and c is a function of signal strength independent of testing
point angular coordinates. x is the actual incident field power density that
can be derived from the signal power and test range loss. The above equation
(2) assumes that the signal variables in both sides of the equation are
expressed in decibels or dB\'s. When m(x)=1 and c=g~0~, where g~0~ is the
received antenna gain at the test point, we would have declared that the RS
report is a true reading of the signal strength. But in reality, m(x) can be
biased by either the signal level relative to the receiver\'s detector
operating condition, or by application software programming errors. Meanwhile,
the offset constant c can also be biased by either the noise floor of the
receiver and/or other artificial factors in the UE RS reporting. Therefore, a
Taylor\'s series can be introduced to have a better representation of the RS
report value:
RSi (x)= c +ax+ bx^2^ +dx^3^ + ex^4^ + .... (3)
In theory, equation (3) may require many terms to represent the RS report
accurately. However, since the reported RS reading in the receive antenna
pattern in (1) has a limited signal dynamic range, the following three term
expression is enough to correct for the reporting errors:
RSi (x)= c +ax+ bx^2^ +o(x^3^) (4)
The third order term o(x^3^) is ignored since it is not significant for
limited signal dynamic range.
The RS pattern in (1) will need to be calibrated for its possible reporting
errors. One practical method is to introduce signal correction terms in
equation (4) to enhance the accuracy. This process is also referred to as the
linearization. The following steps describe what is needed to linearize the RS
report and the RS antenna pattern in (1):
1). Find the maximum RS reading in the pattern obtained in (1) from all
angular test points, and at all polarizations. Set this point as the reference
point and record signal generator power P~0~ and let x~0~ =P~0~-Test Range
Path Loss (in dB), and note the maximum RS reading as r~0~.
2). At the reference test point, decrease the signal generator\'s output power
P~i~, and let x~i~ = P~i~-Test Range Path Loss (in dB), starting from P~0~
with a step size (1.0 dB by default) to a power range so as to obtain the full
RS reading range while searching from the reference point r~0~ when the test
system dynamic range allows, or to 20 dB by default when the system dynamic
range is known to be limited, whichever is lower in range. Record the
corresponding RS reading of the UE as r~i~. Repeat this process until all
angular test points are completed as required.
3). Use those pairs of data obtained in Step 2) (r~i~, x~i~) as the input of
the quadratic fitting curve in (4) to formulate the Algorithm LSF (Least
Square Fit) to calculate the three coefficients (a,b, and c) in:
Err(a,b,c)= Σ(c + ax~i~ + bx~i~ - r~i~)^2^ (5)
Please note that the power range of the linearization can be limited to 20 dB
as stated in Step 2) since the lower RS readings than the processed range do
not contribute to the overall receive antenna pattern as much.
Once the three coefficients (a,b, and c) are obtained in LSF of (5), the use
of the inverse function of Equation (4) to convert RS pattern in (1) into the
normalized incident power pattern. This process completes the error correction
for both constant biased and the non-linearity in the RS report from the UE
within the limited signal dynamic range as tested in (1) and Step 1. Similar
steps can be applied for error corrections if multiple receiver RS are
involved in the testing.
Of course, the reference test point can also be further tested for the
threshold of the receiver sensitivity and/or throughput knee-point for the
required calibrated reference power level.
