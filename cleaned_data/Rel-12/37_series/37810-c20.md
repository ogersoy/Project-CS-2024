# 4 General
Many of the new RF features introduced and studied for RAN4 specifications are
not RAT-specific, but often concern UTRA, E-UTRA and also multi-RAT
specifications including GSM/EDGE. Examples are Carrier Aggregation, non-
contiguous spectrum operation, multiband capability, AAS, etc. This means that
almost identical RF features are often implemented in different RF
specifications, within the same or different work items. This duplication not
only creates additional work and unnecessary discussions on how to implement
new RF features, but in addition often creates unmotivated differences between
the specifications and even misalignment and conflicts between the RF
requirements across the specifications. The problems will be further
accentuated as more features are added and the specifications become more
complex. There is a need to study whether the problems can be avoided for
future specification releases.
## 4.1 Study item objective
The study item objective is to investigate the feasibility of introducing a
new BS specification structure, in order to avoid duplicate specification work
for new RF features (in case of identical features among different RATs) and
to avoid future discussions regarding how to implement the new features in
single-RAT and/or multi-RAT specifications.
For the new possible specification structures, the following areas should be
investigated, considering that no change of existing requirements as a
consequence of the new possible BS specification structure is assumed:
1\. How future RF features can be incorporated across all RATs, with reduced
effort and risk of specification conflicts, considering the possible
differences in requirements among different RATs
2\. How to declare conformance for BS in the new specification structure
3\. Feasibility of compliance of selected future RF feature(s) by legacy BS
that conforms to specifications of previous releases
4\. How to accommodate regulatory references to the new BS specification
structure for single-RAT and multi-RAT Base Stations
5\. How to guarantee that a BS compliant to the new BS specification
structure, for a requirement that is taken from the legacy structure, will
comply to that requirement for each applicable RAT as specified in the legacy
structure
6\. How to migrate the requirements in the present BS specification structure
(including performance requirements) into a new specification structure
# 5 Status of existing BS core specifications
For a possible re-structuring of the BS specifications, it is important to
evaluate and document what the content is of the specifications, how they
relate to each other and what possibilities there is to merge or move text.
This clause documents the status and content of the BS core specifications.
The core specifications for UTRA in TS 25.104 [2] and E-UTRA in TS 36.104 [3]
were thoroughly analysed when the MSR specification TS 37.104 [4] was formed
in Rel-9. TR 37.900 [5] contains a lot of useful analysis, comparisons and
synthesis of the requirements for the work and can be used as a reference also
for the BS spec structure work.
The core specifications can be divided into parts that have different
characteristics and the analysis in this clause follows a similar division:
\- **Clause 3 - Definitions, symbols and abbreviations:** These are partly
overlapping and can most likely be moved/merged at a late stage. Only entries
that are needed in the final spec structure need to be retained.
\- **Clauses 4 & 5 -- General parts:** This text does not contain RF
requirements as such, but there are a lot of general tables defining frequency
bands and numbers, requirement applicability and several clauses giving pre-
conditions for the requirements. Much of the text can be analysed in the same
way as the RF requirements.
\- **Clauses 6, 7 & 8: - Requirements:** The RF and performance requirement
are the heart of the specifications and need careful analysis as to how they
relate to each other.
\- **Annexes: - Additional elements:** The annexes contain both normative and
informative elements, of which a large part is RAT-specific.
When text and requirements are compared between documents, we can divide them
along the following main \"types\":
\- **Identical text:** This is the simplest case to manage, since in the end,
only one copy of the text needs to be maintained.
\- **Similar text:** This case needs more careful analysis. If specifications
are merged, only the relevant varieties of the text needs to be merged, but it
has to be made sure that relevant single-RAT aspects are kept. For an RF
requirement, it has to be identified whether there can be a single merged
requirement or whether specific single-RAT options should be kept.
\- **Different text:** If the text is different for each RAT, both may have to
be kept in a merged specification. For a single-RAT RF requirement, the
single-RAT version may have to be copied as is to the merged specification, if
there are no common elements with other RATs. Single-RAT requirements can also
remain in single-RAT specifications.
Based on the three main types above, the classification of text and
requirement into different \"types\" according to Table 5-1 is used in the
analysis below.
Table 5-1: Classification of text/requirement into \"types\"
* * *
Text/requirement Type identifier (T) Type description ID Identical text, any
version can be kept. SA Similar text/requirement that is quite aligned and can
be easily merged. SM Similar text and/or identical requirement, where only the
multi-RAT version needs to be kept SO Similar text/requirement, where both
multi-RAT option and single-RAT option(s) may have to be kept DK Different
text, where the Single-RAT version is RAT unique and will have to be kept DM
Different text that is unique to the MSR specification RE Reference to single-
RAT requirement.

TDD WA BS is characterized by requirements derived from Macro Cell and Micro
Cell scenarios with BS to UE coupling losses equal to 70 dB and 53 dB.
Regional requirements 4.3 SA 4.3 SA 4.4 SA Similar text that is related to
specific requirements. Should be merged on a per requirement basis.
Environmental requirements for the BS equipment 4.4 TBD - - Similar
requirements exist in all UTRA specs but not in E-UTRA and MSR. Applicability
of requirements - 4.4 TBD 5 TBD This text is dependent on the present
structure of one spec per RAT. Some of the requirement applicability may need
to be changed if specs are potentially merged. Requirements for contiguous and
non-contiguous spectrum N/A 5.8 SA 4.7 SA Quite aligned between E-UTRA and
MSR. There are no requirements for non-contiguous spectrum operation for UTRA
TDD 1.28 Mcps option. Operating bands and channel arrangement (general) 5.1 SA

# 6 Status of existing BS conformance specifications
This clause documents the status and content of the BS conformance test
specifications. The test specifications for UTRA in TS 25.141 [11] and E-UTRA
in TS 36.141 [12] were thoroughly analysed when the MSR test specification TS
37.141 [12] was formed in Rel-9. TR 37.900 [5] contains a lot of useful
analysis, comparisons and synthesis of the requirements for the work and can
be used as a reference also for the BS spec structure work.
The core specifications were classified in \"types\" that have different
characteristics and the analysis of the conformance test requirements in this
clause follows a similar approach. When text and requirements are compared
between documents, the following same \"types\" are used as for core
requirements, but with the additional types \"DT\", \"CR\", \"TT\" and \"TM\"
to cover certain aspects of test requirements.
Based on the three main types above, the classification of text and
requirement into different \"types\" according to Table 6-1 is used in the
analysis below.
Table 6-1: Classification of text/requirement into \"types\"
* * *
Text/requirement Type identifier (T) Type description ID Identical text, any
version can be kept. SA Similar text/requirement/procedure that is well
aligned and can be easily merged. SM Similar text/requirement/procedure, where
the multi-RAT version covers the single-RAT ones. Some parameters may be RAT
specific, as specified in the minimum or test requirement. SO Similar
text/requirement/procedure, where a both multi-RAToption and a single-RAT
option may have to be kept DK Different text/requirement/procedure, where the
Single-RAT version is RAT unique and will have to be kept DM Different
text/requirement/procedure that is unique to the MSR specification RE
Reference to single-RAT requirement. DT Similar text/requirement/procedure,
but with different test signals/test configuration. CR Analysis of the
requirements can be found in the core requirement analysis. TT Analysis of the
requirements can be found in the core requirement analysis, but test
tolerances are different between RATs. TM Text/requirement/procedure missing,
where they should be specified in the specification
* * *
NOTE: The analysis provided in clause 6 should be viewed as a first input,
with additional analysis of e.g. the applicable test configurations to come
later in the Work Item phase.

# 7 Status of existing BS EMC specifications
This clause documents the status and content of the BS EMC specifications. The
EMC specifications for UTRA (FDD and TDD) in TS 25.113 [13] and E-UTRA in TS
36.113 [14] were analysed when the MSR test specification TS 37.113 [15] was
formed in Rel-9. TR 37.900 [5] contains the analysis, comparisons and
synthesis of the requirements for the work and can be used as a reference also
for the BS spec structure work.
The core specifications were classified in \"types\" that have different
characteristics and the analysis of the conformance EMC requirements in this
clause follows a similar approach. When text and requirements are compared
between documents, the same \"types\" are used as for core and test
requirement analysis.
Based on the three main types above, the classification of text and
requirement into different \"types\" according to Table 6-1 is used in the
analysis below. The analysis covers the EMC specifications containing
requirements for UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and Eâ€‘UTRA.
Table 6-1: Classification of text/requirement into \"types\"
* * *
Text/requirement Type identifier (T) Type description ID Identical text, any
version can be kept. SA Similar text/requirement/procedure that is well
aligned and can be easily merged. SM Similar text/requirement/procedure, where
the multi-RAT version covers the single-RAT ones. Some parameters may be RAT
specific, as specified in the minimum or test requirement. SO Similar
text/requirement/procedure, where a generic multi-RAT text plus a single-RAT
option may have to be kept DK Different text/requirement/procedure, where the
Single-RAT version is RAT unique and will have to be kept DM Different
text/requirement/procedure that is unique to the MSR specification
* * *
NOTE: The analysis provided in clause 6 should be viewed as a first input,
with additional analysis to come later in the Work Item phase.

# 8 Alternatives for the BS specification structure
The existing structure of the BS specification can be illustrated in a
simplified way as in Figure 8-1. The figure shows the core specifications TS
25.104 [2] for UTRA FDD, TS 25.105 [16] for UTRA TDD and TS 36.104 [3] for
E-UTRA on the sides, together with the multi-RAT specification TS 37.104 [4]
placed in the middle. The conformance test specifications (XX.141) and EMC
specifications (XX.113) are not included, but those specifications have the
same structural relationship. The UTRA TDD specification is not included in
the figure.
A few \"types\" of requirements are illustrated in Figure 8-1. The first type
are those RF requirements that has different description in the single-RAT
specifications than for multi-RAT. The single-RAT requirements are identified
as [Single-RAT UF] for UTRA FDD, [Single-RAT UT] for UTRA TDD (with the
addition of 1.28, 3.84 and 7.68 to distinguish between the chip rates) and
[Single-RAT E] for E-UTRA, while the corresponding multi-RAT requirement is
identified as [Sngl/Multi-RAT]. Note that the scope of the multi-RAT
requirement includes single-RAT operation. The cross-references for multiple
requirements are illustrated with a thick dotted arrow and a thinner solid
arrow for performance requirements.
The second type are those requirements that is described in the single-RAT
specifications, while TS 37.104 [4] only has a normative reference to the
single-RAT requirements, identified as [Reference UF] , [Reference UT] and
[Reference E].
The third type is the performance requirements, which are in clause 8 of all
specifications. Here all requirements are pure single-RAT and the complete
single-RAT clauses are referenced from TS 37.104 [4] also identified as
[Reference UF], [Reference UT] and [Reference E].
Figure 8-1 will be used as a baseline to describe the different alternatives
for changing the BS specification structure.
Figure 8-1: Baseline (existing) BS core specification structure (simplified
view)
## 8.1 Alternative 1: Merge into a single specification
The most far-reaching change of the BS specification structure would be to
make a complete merge of all requirements into a single specification. The
merged specification TS 37.1xx would contain all types of requirements and
cover both single-RAT and multi-RAT capable BS for all RATs (excluding GSM
single-RAT).
Such a single spec structure is illustrated in Figure 8.1-1.
Figure 8.1-1: Alternative 1 for the BS specification structure (simplified
view)
Pros of Alternative 1:
\- Only a single specification to maintain for single-RAT and multi-RAT,
replacing TS 25.104, TS 36.104 and TS 37.104.
Cons of Alternative 1:
\- There is no visibility of the previous structure for backwards
compatibility, making it more difficult to perform maintenance (Cat A CRs) and
follow feature update through releases.
\- Risk of high specification complexity with everything in one document.
## 8.2 Alternative 2: Single spec with shadow single-RAT specs
In order to keep traceability of legacy single-RAT requirements, there could
be reasons to keep the single-RAT specifications, but without normative
content. The only thing left in the single-RAT \"shadow\" specifications would
be references to identify where in the merged single/multi-RAT specification
that the corresponding requirements are found. In this way the old
specifications would remain, but not contain any actual requirements, only
references to the new specifications. The \"shadow\" legacy specifications in
the new structure would not require any actual maintenance, since they would
not contain any description of or limits for requirements. Any correction or
new feature would only need to be done in the new merged specification.
The merged specification TS 37.1xx would contain all types of requirements and
cover both single-RAT and multi-RAT capable BS for all RATs (excluding GSM
single-RAT) as in TS 37.104 [4].
Such a structure with \"shadow\" single-RAT and multi-RAT specs is illustrated
in Figure 8.2-1.
Figure 8.2-1: Alternative 2 for the BS specification structure (simplified
view)
Pros of Alternative 2:
\- Visibility of the previous structure for backwards compatibility through
the \"shadow spec\" references, thereby facilitating maintenance (Cat A CRs)
and to follow feature update through releases.
\- A single specification to maintain and extend with new features for single-
RAT and multi-RAT, replacing TS 25.104, TS 36.104 and TS 37.104, with a
unified set of requirements for single-RAT and multi-RAT.
Cons of Alternative 2:
\- Will need to keep the \"shadow\" TS 25.104, TS 36.104 and TS 37.104 specs
(though there will be no maintenance needed).
\- Risk of high specification complexity with everything in one document.
## 8.3 Alternative 3: Separate performance specs and shadow single-RAT specs
When the single RAT requirements are merged together with the existing
single/multi-RAT requirements into a unified specification, it could end up
being a very large document. In order to keep the size of the document
reasonable, the single-RAT performance requirements (chapter 8) could be moved
to separate new single-RAT specifications.
Such a structure with separate single-RAT performance specs is illustrated in
Figure 8.3-1. Except for the separate single-RAT performance specifications,
the structure is the same as in Alternative 2, containing a new merged
specification and \"shadow\" legacy specifications containing references only.
The cross-references for multiple RF requirements are illustrated with a thick
arrow and for the performance requirements with a thinner arrow.
Figure 8.3-1: Alternative 3 for the BS specification structure (simplified
view)
Pros of Alternative 3:
\- Visibility of the previous structure for backwards compatibility through
the \"shadow spec\" references, thereby facilitating maintenance (Cat A CRs)
and to follow feature update through releases.
\- The set of new specifications are in themselves easier to maintain and
extend with new features, with a unified set of requirements for single-RAT
and multi-RAT.
\- Separate RF performance specification and Demodulation performance
specifications (per RAT) to ensure that the complexity of each specification
can be minimized.
Cons of Alternative 3:
\- Will need to keep the \"shadow\" TS 25.104, TS 36.104 and TS 37.104 specs
(though there will be no maintenance needed).
## 8.3a Alternative 3a: Cross referencing between a new unified specification
for RF requirements and existing single-RAT specifications for performance
requirements.
When the single RAT requirements are merged together with the existing
single/multi-RAT requirements into a unified specification, it could end up
being a very large document. In order to keep the size of the document
reasonable, the single-RAT performance requirements (chapter 8) remain in the
existing single-RAT specifications and for the performance requirements, the
new unified specification refers back to these single-RAT specifications in
the same way as the present MSR specification (TS 37.104 [4]) does.
The structure is illustrated in Figure 8.3a-1. The difference from Alternative
3 is there are no separate single-RAT performance specifications. For the
performance requirements, the new unified BS specification referenced back to
each of the original (existing) single-RAT specification. The cross-references
for multiple RF requirements are illustrated with a thick arrow.
Figure 8.3a-1: Alternative 3a for the BS specification structure (simplified
view)
Pros of Alternative 3a:
\- Visibility of the previous structure for backwards compatibility by keeping
the existing single-RAT specifications. For the RF requirements, these single-
RAT specifications refer to the new unified specification which captures all
the RF requirements in it. On the contrary, the new unified specification
refers back to each single-RAT specification for performance the requirements.
\- For the RF related requirements, only the new unified specification should
be maintained if essential corrections are needed after a certain work will be
completed. For the performance part, the existing single-RAT specifications
will be maintained if necessary (as per today) and no additional work load in
needed to establish the new BS structure.
\- The complexity of the new specification is reduced, since demodulation
performance remains in existing single RAT specifications.
Cons of Alternative 3a:
\- We will need to keep the existing TS 25.104, TS 36.104 specifications (to
maintain their performance part), while TS37.104 could be 'virtually closed
(Stopping maintenance)' in the future. For the time being, all of these
existing specifications should be kept alive.
## 8.4 Alternative 4: New BS RF and Performance Specification
In this alternative, two new BS specifications will be created; one for RF
core requirements, including all the general, regulatory and regional
requirements. The other new specification is for performance (demodulation)
requirements. This is illustrated in Figure 8.4-1.
The RF core requirements include all the requirements in clause 4, 5, 6 and 7
of 25- , 36- and 37- series BS RF specifications. RF core requirements in TS
25.104, TS 25.105 and TS 36.104 are single-RAT requirements. The performance
requirements are related to the BS demodulation performance requirements in
clause 8 (including some annexes) in 25- , 36- and 37- series BS RF
specifications. The BS demodulation performance requirements in TS 37.104 are
basically referenced back to the single-RAT specifications. Therefore, these
single-RAT requirements can be migrated to the new BS demodulation performance
specification.
However, certain requirements can be referenced back to other specifications
in order to reduce the complexity of new BS RF specifications. In order to
keep those requirements in the legacy specification, these requirements should
be stable and unlikely to change over time in order to minimise additional
maintenance efforts.
To overcome the issues of legacy BS compliancy, regulatory and regional
requirements, a transition period is used to ensure that the existing 25- ,
36- and 37- series BS RF specifications are maintained in parallel with the
new BS specifications. After the transition period, those legacy
specifications can be frozen (i.e. no need to be maintained by the MCC).
NOTE: How some of the legacy single-RAT requirements should be handled (e.g.
TDD single-RAT) after the transition period should be further studied. If
those requirements are to be maintained and/or kept, then cross-referencing
those requirements between legacy specification and the new specification
structure may be needed
{width="5.5375in" height="4.742361111111111in"}
Figure 8.4-1: Alternative 4 for the BS specification structure (simplified
view)
Pros of Alternative 4:
\- A transition period is given to the legacy specifications (TS 25.104, TS
25.105, TS 36.104 and TS 37.104) to ensure that backward compatibility,
regulatory and regional requirements, field deployment issues can be resolved
on time.
\- Separate RF performance specification and Demodulation performance
specification to reduce complexity of each specification can be minimised.
\- The set of new specifications are in themselves easier to maintain and
extend with new features, with a unified set of requirements for single-RAT
and multi-RAT.
Cons of Alternative 4:
\- Additional parallel maintenance efforts for both legacy specifications and
new specifications during the transition period.
\- Due to cessation of legacy specifications maintenance, there may be
confusion as no mapping of requirements between legacy and new specifications
to facilitate any potential maintenance (i.e. Cat A CRs).
\- Two more specifications to maintain and keep aligned than in the legacy
specification structure.
# 9 Managing future RF features in a new structure
The topic of how to manage future RF features in a new structure should be
studied for the new alternative structures proposed and really boils down to
the specifications being \"future proof\".
The following are \"types\" of requirements that need to be managed:
A) Requirement documented only in RAT-specific single-RAT version(s) (UTRA
and/or E-UTRA): It is today updated per RAT (as applicable) for any new
feature added. In a new structure, the single-RAT versions will have to be
kept since they are different and any new feature would have to be added in
the same way as today.
B) Requirement documented in virtually identical single-RAT version(s) (UTRA
and/or E-UTRA) and multi-RAT version: It is today updated per RAT (as
applicable) plus multi-RAT, for any new feature added. In a new structure, it
would be possible to have only one single, generic version for all RATs,
including multi-RAT. Any new feature would be added only once to the
\"merged\" generic requirement.
C) Requirement documented in different single-RAT version(s) (UTRA and/or
E-UTRA) plus a multi-RAT version: It is today updated per RAT (as applicable)
plus multi-RAT, for any new feature added. In a new structure, it would be
possible to keep both single-RAT and multi-RAT requirement options in the
specification. A new feature may be added to any requirement option as needed.
Examples of requirements of the above types are
\- Type A: Performance (chapter 8)
\- Type B: Spurious emissions
\- Type C: Spectrum mask/UEM
The types of requirements above can be managed if proper care is taken when
merging specifications. The most important conclusion is that a merged Type B
generic requirement (if possible) makes new features and feature maintenance
much easier. There are however single-RAT requirements and options, where
multiple versions will need updates and maintenance, for legacy reasons. It
should be noted however for Type A and C, that just by putting the separate
single-RAT requirements in the same documents makes inclusion of new features
and maintenance easier, since any difference or divergence will stand out.
This is the same advantage that was achieved by putting FDD and TDD in the
same specification for E-UTRA.
# 10 Conformance declaration
Conformance declaration is normally made in relation to the test
specification, declaring what requirements (and corresponding tests) that a BS
is conforming with. The structure and layout of the requirements in the
specification needs to be clear, so that a conformation declaration does not
become ambiguous. It should also be clear from the overall structure of the
set of specifications which documents you need to declare conformance to.
There are already today multiple Options for some RF requirements, even in the
single-RAT specifications. The reason is that some limits may be regional
(e.g. Category A/B spurious emissions and other regional limits) or there may
be multiple options for other reasons (UEM mask options). If requirements are
merged, it is likely that there will be more options for some requirements,
especially single-RAT options. This will require careful drafting of a merged
specification to avoid ambiguous statements.
One way to identify which requirements are applicable for each RAT capability
is through an \"Applicability\" table such as in the present TS 37.141. Here
the applicable requirements are related to a declared \"Capability Set\" (CSx)
that identifies the RAT capability of the BS. Such a structure should be re-
used and possibly enhanced in a merged specification covering multiple RAT
combinations.
A problem when merging specs for different RATs that has been identified in
the analysis of the specifications is that the number of requirement options
may increase. Since there may be varying requests from the market as to what
requirement options to declare conformance to, there is a risk of an increased
burden in terms of conformance testing and documentation. This could be more
efficiently handled if it is made clear in the merged specification which
requirement option(s) that are inherently fulfilled by testing according to a
specific requirement. Such a description could e.g. be presented as a mapping
table between requirements tested and requirement options that are inherently
met by the test.
# 11 Compliance for legacy BS
Regarding compliance for legacy BS in a new BS spec structure, it is noted
that the multi-RAT/single-RAT requirements as defined to day in TS 37.104 will
remain as they are, since they are based on the study done of single-RAT
requirements during the MSR work [5]. Both single-RAT and multi-RAT
requirements will however have to be kept in a new structure for both legacy
and new BS, in order to make it possible to also upgrade legacy BS to new
releases.
The legacy requirement must be kept in the new BS specification structure,
since otherwise legacy BS hardware would need to be upgraded to be compliant
to the new requirements in future releases. This would also be the case for
software upgrades for a future release, in case the BS hardware is designed
based on legacy requirements. By maintaining the legacy requirements in the
new BS specification structure (as stated in the SI objective), these problems
can be avoided.
# 12 Regulatory references for Base Stations
## 12.1 General
One area of study is how to accommodate regulatory references to the new BS
specification structure for single-RAT and multi-RAT Base Stations. Since
regional SDOs develops standards that may directly or indirectly reference
3GPP standards, feedback from the regional SDOs on a possible new BS
specification structure will be valuable as future input to the work. There
are also references to take into account in the ITU-R recommendations for IMT.
In order to avoid invalidating references from external documents to
particular clause, table or figure, it is essential and important to check
with the each drafting rules in [17] and follow them when we establish the new
BS specification structure from the existing ones. Especially the following
drafting rule should be strictly applied:
\- Hanging paragraphs should be avoided.
\- When removing existing contents in TSs, they should be replaced by the term
'void' and the title of the section will be retained.
\- 'Sequential numbering' scheme in the original single RAT TS cannot be kept.
Instead general renumbering should be done manually in the new unified TS. If
necessary, cross reference table gathering original numbering in the original
specification to the renumbered numbers in the new specification could be
considered.
## 12.2 Regulatory references in ETSI
The following is based on feedback received from ETSI MSG TFES [8].
It is noted by TFES that presently, there is in ETSI an IMT harmonized
standard part for each 3GPP BS type (UTRA, E-UTRA and MSR) containing BS RF
requirements. There is also one requirement (Radiated emissions) in the common
harmonized standards part (Part 1) for all BS types. Presently, TFES is
initiating work on its 7^th^ standards release, corresponding to 3GPP Release
11. Work on the 8^th^ release, corresponding to 3GPP Release 12, will not
start until late 2014 or in 2015.
The ETSI harmonized standards for IMT have both direct and indirect references
to the 3GPP BS specifications. It is noted that direct references can be
updated in the ETSI harmonized standards to reference new parts of the 3GPP
documentation, in case the target of the direct reference is restructured or
moved.
A substantial amount of text in the IMT BS harmonized standards is partially
aligned with the 3GPP BS specifications without direct reference, thereby
giving \"indirect reference\" to the 3GPP specifications. If needed, this text
is possible to update for the 8th release of the IMT harmonized standard, in
order to maintain an alignment with the 3GPP BS specifications, in case the
layout of the requirements would change because of a restructuring.
Though ETSI MSG TFES has not evaluated what changes that will be made to the
BS and EMC specification structure at this time, it is noted that it is
possible to adapt also the structure of the multi-part ETSI harmonized
standards for IMT, if deemed necessary by TFES.
## 12.3 Regulatory references in ARIB
The following is based on feedback received from ARIB [9].
ARIB notes that prudent consideration how to accommodate regulatory references
to the new BS specification structure for single-RAT and multi-RAT Base
Stations are one of the important aspects in this study. As one of SDOs which
transposes some of these specifications from 3GPP standards to of its own,
ARIB provides the following observations:
1\. It is observed that there will be no change in the existing requirements
in BS or EMC RF specifications as the consequence of the study in RAN4 since
the objective section of the study item description sheet in [2] states as
follows:
'no change of existing requirements as a consequence of the new possible BS
specification structure is assumed'.
2\. It would be worthwhile to note that several requirements for different
single RATs in 3GPP in different releases are referred by at least two ITU-R
Recommendations. As an example, for the case of BS Radio transmission and
Reception specifications for single RAT cases;
â‘  Section 5.1 (IMT-2000 CDMA Direct Spread) in Recommendation ITU-R M.1457 [6]
refers to:
\- UTRA BS (FDD) requirements in ARIB STD-T63-25.104 from Rel-99 to Rel-10
\- E-UTRA BS requirements in ARIB STD-T63-36.104 from Rel-8 to Rel-10
â‘¡ Section 5.3 (IMT-2000 CDMA TDD) in Recommendation ITU-R M.1457 [6] refers
to:
\- UTRA BS (TDD) requirements in ARIB STD-T63-25.105 from Rel-99 to Rel-10
\- E_UTRA BS requirements in ARIB STD-T63-36.104 from Rel-8 to Rel-10
â‘¢ Annex 1 (Specification of the LTE-Advanced radio interface technology) in
Recommendation ITU-R M.2012 [7] refers to:
\- E-UTRA BS requirements in ARIB STD-T104-36.104 in Release 10.

Each of the ARIB standards mentioned above was transposed from its
corresponding 3GPP technical specification.
Neither the above list nor table is not exhaustive and shows a part of
referenced specifications in ARIB, the referenced structure is complicated
enough. Therefore paying attention to distinction between referenced
requirements for different RATs and different releases would be one of the key
aspects when to consider the specification structure.
3\. The effect of test tolerances on the regulatory aspect should not be
overlooked. Since the conformance test requirements in 3GPP, such as TS25.141
(UTRA FDD), TS25.142 (UTRA TDD) or TS36.141 (E-UTRA FDD/TDD), capture the test
tolerances, keeping consistent structure of these conformance test
requirements with that of corresponding requirements in specifications for
Radio transmission and Reception would be another focal point of the study.
## 12.4 Regulatory references in ITU-R recommendations
There may also be impact on ITU-R recommendations, which should be
investigated. ITU-R has two recommendations describing the Radio Interface
Technologies (RIT) for IMT-2000 (M.1457-11 [6]) and for IMT-Advanced (M.2012
[7]). There are no references to the 3GPP BS specifications from the technical
description of the RITs concerned. There are however lists in the two
recommendations of the relevant 3GPP specifications that give the \"Detailed
specification of the radio interface\". The lists identify the specifications
that the relevant SDOs need to transpose from the set of 3GPP specs and make
available from their web sites, with references to all our BS core,
conformance and EMC specifications. This includes the single-RAT
specifications (25-series and 36-series) and multi-RAT specifications
(37-series). The single-RAT 25-series is listed only for IMT-2000.
If 3GPP implements a new structure of the BS specification in Rel-12, there
would be a new set of specifications to list in the coming versions of M.1457
and M.2012, in place of the ones listed now. It is noted that changing the set
of referenced transposed specifications in itself would create a problem. What
could be investigated further is if there would be a need to include a note in
the ITU-R recommendations to identify which recommendations in previous
releases that the new ones correspond to.
## 12.5 Regulatory references in CCSA
The following is based on feedback received from CCSA [18].
It is noted that in CCSA the standard part for each 3GPP BS type (UTRA and
E-UTRA) containing BS RF requirements is included in the specifications of
technical requirement and test method for NodeB/eNodeB equipment.
As one of the Organizational Partners in 3GPP, CCSA specifications make
references to some of the 3GPP standards. Therefore, CCSA would like to make
the following observations:
1\. Maintaining an efficient document structure is an important aspect of
standardization work and CCSA fully understands importance of TSG RAN WG4 work
to investigate the feasibility of introducing a new specification structure to
avoid duplicate specification work for new RF features and to avoid future
discussions regarding how to implement the new features in single-RAT and/or
multi-RAT specifications.
2\. According to the objective section of Study Item in, 'no change of
existing requirements as a consequence of the new possible BS specification
structure is assumed', it is concluded that there will be no impacts on the
existing CCSA requirements in BS or EMC RF specifications, except for some
minor changes such as reference structure in the existing specifications. CCSA
will carefully study these influences.
3\. It is noted that CCSA specifications is developing Stage-7 specifications
corresponding to 3GPP Release 10.
# 13 Compliance to legacy requirements for each RAT
It is discussed in clause 11 how to make compliance for legacy BS possible in
a new BS spec structure possible. Another separate study area concerns the
\"reverse\" issue, i.e. how to ensure compliance to legacy requirements for
each RAT in a new structure.
The SID objective states that \"no change of existing requirements as a
consequence of the new possible BS specification structure is assumed\". This
implies that a requirement stated in one of the specifications today should
also remain and be covered by a merged specification.
Since the key here is to ensure compliance to legacy requirements, which is
the topic of this clause, it would _in principle_ only be necessary to keep
the most stringent one if there are multiple legacy requirements. This is
however not the case, since all legacy requirement options would have to be
kept, since it is clear from the SI objective that requirements cannot be
changed (or removed).
With all requirement options merged to a new BS specification structure, there
are really two cases:
\- If there is only a single requirement in the new structure, that
requirement must then be identical to the legacy requirement(s).
\- If there are multiple requirement options in the new structure, it must
then be identified clearly which requirement that corresponds to a specific
requirement in the legacy structure and for which RAT it is valid.
In both cases, a BS compliant to the new BS specification structure, for a
requirement that is taken from the legacy structure, will comply with that
requirement for each applicable RAT as specified in the legacy structure.
# 14 Migration of BS specification structure
For the migration of the existing 25-, 36- and 37- series specifications into
the new specification structure, the following aspects need to be considered:
\- Analysis of each requirement by comparing it across 25-, 36- and 37- series
specifications.
\- Determination of new specification structure through the alternatives
proposed in Clause 8. Based on the chosen alternative, a clear structure will
be in place to base the migration on.
\- Handling of regulatory requirements. These requirements are unique and
highly dependent on the external SDOs.
A work item plan for a New BS specification structure should describe what
further studies that may be needed and in what order the specifications can be
migrated through CRs. The analysis made in the study item of core, test and
EMC specification will be very useful for the actual CR drafting, since it
maps the requirements across the specifications and identifies which ones are
well aligned already today and which ones that are more complex. The study of
core requirements have been very thorough, while it is likely that some more
detailed analysis will be needed for the test and EMC specifications in a WI
phase.
From the specification analysis, it seems that the test specifications have
the most complex relations due to the many elements involved such as test
models, test configurations, test signal generation, procedures etc. The core
requirements have a cleaner structure and relationship between specifications.
A re-structuring could therefore start with the core specifications. While
that is on-going, further analysis could be done of the test specifications
and possibly the EMC specifications (if needed). As a second step after that,
the test specifications can be merged into the new structure, to align with
the core specifications. If the mapping between the structures is well
defined, there should be no problem to have this phased approach for the
migration.
The EMC specifications can be done as a final step. They are not updated with
new features very often and have a simpler structure with fewer requirements
and can therefore be updated independently. Note that EMC specifications are
pure conformance test specifications, with no corresponding core requirement
documented.
A work item for a New BS specification structure can then be conducted in four
phases:
1\. Development and preparation of the new specification structure and further
analysis of the specifications
2\. Produce a new core specification and CRs to existing core specifications
3\. Produce a new test specification and CRs to existing test specifications
4\. Produce a new EMC specification CRs to existing EMC specifications
One possibility is to run the preparation phase over two meeting cycles and
then have one meeting cycle each of the three CR phases. This should give
sufficient time for further analysis and development of the structure before
drafting CRs. Since the approached is phased care has to be taken to make sure
that the consistency is maintained between core and test specifications
In the migration, there may be CRs submitted in parallel for other Rel-12 work
items and Cat A CRs stemming from previous releases. Those have to be tracked
carefully by the MCC and the WI Rapporteur, since any type of CR can be seen
as overlapping with a re-structuring CR. These CRs will have to be
\"overlaid\" on the restructuring. This should work, since the re-structuring
will not change any actual requirements. It may not really be possible to
\"hold off\" CRs of other on-going work items, considering the RAN4 time
schedule. There is however no work item in Rel-12 with a large impact on the
BS specifications, so the impact may actually be larger from Cat A CRs.
During the WI phase, the work format could be to use a TR to document decision
on the structure and attachments in the form of draft TS text, to be used as
basis for the coming new specifications. It is however noted that in the end a
single CR per existing specification plus a new specification will be needed
and it has to be produced in a single meeting cycle from the latest
specification version.
# 15 Conclusion and Recommendation
TSG RAN4 has studied the 3GPP BS specification structure in order to determine
the feasibility of a new BS specification structure, in order to avoid
duplicate specification work for new RF features (in case of identical
features among different RATs) and to avoid future discussions regarding how
to implement the new features in single-RAT and/or multi-RAT specifications.
The focus has been on possibilities to migrate the present set of RAT-specific
specifications into a smaller set of specifications that cover more than one
RAT.
The following study areas are covered and concluded:
1\. **Future RF features:** Some requirement can differ between RATs, since
they may be RAT-specific or because there are different versions for other
reasons such as regional variations. It is concluded that this can be managed
by keeping all requirement options. There would still be a synergy in terms of
having a common updating and maintenance in a merged specification, even for
requirement with variations between RATs.
2\. **Conformance declaration** : There may be different requirements between
RATs and also variations within a RAT and these different options will have to
be uniquely defined in a merged specification. By clearly identifying the
applicability of each requirement in terms of RATs and configuration, proper
references can be made in a conformance declaration.
3\. **Compliance for legacy BS:** It is concluded that since the legacy
requirement options are kept in a new structure, compliance for legacy BS from
previous releases will be maintained in the new structure.
4\. **Regulatory References for BS** : It will be important to follow the 3GPP
drafting guide lines properly in order to accommodate regulatory references.
Liaisons have also been sent to regional SDOs to confirm that a re-structuring
of the specifications does not have a detrimental impact on regulatory
references.
5\. **Compliance to legacy requirements** : It is concluded that both for the
cases where a merged specification will contain a single \"unified\"
requirement and for the cases where there will be multiple requirement
options, compliance to legacy requirements for each RAT will be maintained for
a BS complying with the new BS specification structure.
6\. **Migration of BS specifications** : The migration can be done in phases,
starting with a preparation phase when also some further studies will be made.
This can be followed by a staggered creation of new core, conformance test and
EMC specifications, each accompanied by CRs to existing specifications.
Overall, there was no major issue identified among the study areas that would
prohibit a migration of the BS specifications to a smaller set covering more
than one RAT. There was however several topics identified where care must be
taken during a migration to a new structure.
A detailed analysis has also been performed of the 3GPP BS specifications, in
order to identify relationships between requirements across specifications and
to document which ones that can easily be migrated and which ones that will
require more care.
\- **Core specifications:** While many requirements are identical or very
similar between the specifications, there are also a number of requirements
where there are different options that will need to be kept that are either
RAT-specific or with regional applicability. This must be done in a way that
minimizes complexity of the new specification.
\- **Conformance test specifications** : The same relation between
requirements exists as for core specifications, but there are also other
variations to consider. While many tests are generic in nature, there are some
variations in test procedures and test configurations that will need to be
considered. More detailed analysis, especially of test configurations, will be
needed in the work item phase.
\- **EMC specifications** : The EMC specifications are much more generic in
nature and there are quite few variations between the specifications
concerning test procedures. The EMC requirements and limits are well
harmonized across the specifications.
Considering the analysis made and also other relevant criteria for migration
of the BS specifications, five different alternatives for a new BS
specification structure have been evaluated. Alternative 3a as illustrated in
Figure 15â€‘1 was determined to be the most suitable options, since it provides
a high visibility of the previous structure for regulatory references and a
single RF specification to be maintained together with separate documentation
of demodulation performance requirements for each RAT, in order to reduce the
complexity of each document. The structure in Figure 15-1 is documented in
more detail in subclause 8.3a.
