# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The minimum requirements are given in TS 37.104 [2] and the references
therein. Test requirements are given in this specification or are included by
reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS 25.142 [12], TS 36.141 [9] or TS 51.021 [11].
Test Tolerances for the test requirements explicitly stated in the present
specification are defined in Annex C of this specification. Test Tolerances
for test requirements included by reference are defined in the respective
referred test specification.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in subclause 4.10.
## 6.2 Base Station output power
### 6.2.1 Base Station maximum output power
#### 6.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
Output power of the Base Station is the mean power delivered to a load with
resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the transmitter.
The maximum total output power, P~max~, of the Base Station is the mean power
level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period in a
specified reference condition.
The maximum RAT output power, P~max,RAT~, of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific RAT in a specified reference condition.
The maximum carrier output power, P~max,c~ of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific carrier in a specified reference condition.
The rated carrier output power, P~Rated,c~, of the base station is the mean
power level for a specific carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal test
environment in Annex B.
The rated carrier output power of the BS shall be as specified in Table 6.2-1.
Table 6.2-1 Base Station rated carrier output power
* * *
BS class P~Rated,c~ Wide Area BS (note) Medium Range BS ≤+ 38 dBm Local Area
BS ≤+ 24 dBm NOTE: There is no upper limit for the rated carrier output power
of the Wide Area Base Station.
* * *
#### 6.2.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.2.1.
#### 6.2.1.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the accuracy of the maximum carrier output power
across the frequency range and under normal and extreme conditions for all
transmitters in the BS.
#### 6.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~
in single-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
In addition, a single test shall be performed under extreme power supply
conditions as defined in Annex B.5. In this case, it is sufficient to test on
a single combination of one ARFCN, UARFCN or E-ARFCN, one Base Station RF
Bandwidth position and with only one applicable test configuration defined in
clause 5.
NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply also test extreme temperature.
Connect the power measuring equipment to the MSR Base Station antenna
connector as shown in Annex D.1.1.
##### 6.2.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Measure the mean power for each carrier at the Base Station antenna
connector.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
3) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.2.1.5 Test requirements
In normal conditions, the measurement result in step 2 of subclause 6.2.1.4.2
shall for UTRA and E-UTRA remain:
within +2.7 dB and --2.7 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated carrier output power
for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz,
within +3.0 dB and --3.0 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated output power for
carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \ 3) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.6.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.6.1.5 Test requirements
The measurement result in step 2 of 6.6.1.4.2 shall not exceed the maximum
level specified in Table 6.6.1.5.1-1 to Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 if applicable for
the BS under test.
The test requirements of either subclause 6.6.1.5.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 6.6.1.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. In addition for a BS
operating in Band Category 2, the test requirements of 6.6.1.5.3 shall apply
in case of Category B limits.
##### 6.6.1.5.1 Spurious emissions (Category A)
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table

##### 6.6.1.5.4 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS
This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent the
receivers of Base Stations being desensitised by emissions from the BS
transmitter. It is measured at the transmit antenna port for any type of BS
which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table
6.6.1.5.4-1, depending on the declared Base Station class and Band Category.

Local Area BS BC1,BC2 F~UL_low~ -- F~UL_high~ -88 dBm 100 kHz
* * *
##### 6.6.1.5.5 Additional spurious emission requirements
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the
present document is given in subclause 4.4.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below. The power of any spurious emission shall not
exceed the limits of Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 for a BS where requirements for co-
existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of
multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of
Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in
Band 25 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 do not
apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink
operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). Emission limits for this excluded
frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table 4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-
existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements
are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and
10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.5.5-2: BS Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with
PHS
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 1884.5 ‑ 1915.7 MHz
-41 dBm 300 kHz Applicable for co-existence with PHS system operating in
1884.5-1915.7MHz NOTE: The requirement is not applicable in China.
* * *
The following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 41 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range
from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to
10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.5.5-3: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 41
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 2505MHz -- 2535MHz
-42dBm 1 MHz  
2535MHz -- 2655MHz -22dBm 1 MHz Applicable at offsets ≥ 250% of channel
bandwidth from carrier frequency NOTE: This requirement applies for 10 or 20
MHz E-UTRA carriers allocated within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-2645MHz.
* * *
In addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.1.5.1 to 6.6.1.5.4 and above
in the present subclause, the BS may have to comply with the applicable
emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [8], when deployed in regions
where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.
The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 30 in certain
regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10
MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz
above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.5.5-4: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 30
* * *
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note 2200MHz -- 2345MHz
-45dBm 1 MHz  
2362.5MHz -- 2365MHz -25dBm 1 MHz  
2365MHz -- 2367.5MHz -40dBm 1 MHz  
2367.5MHz -- 2370MHz -42dBm 1 MHz  
2370MHz -- 2395MHz -45dBm 1 MHz

##### 6.6.1.5.6 Co-location with other Base Stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed
in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For
BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
column of Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the
co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [14].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table
4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the
same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
### 6.6.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band to the lower Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to 10 MHz above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink operating band. In addition, for
a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block
gap. In addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification,
except for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation. The
requirements in TS 45.005 [6] as defined in subclause 6.6.2.3 apply to an MSR
Base Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band
Category 2.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF Bandwidth gap are
not applicable.
#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.6.2.1, 6.6.2.2,
6.6.2.3 and 6.6.2.4.
#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the MSR BS, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.
#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test
For some of the test cases Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 refer to single-RAT
specifications; see clause 5. In this case the following shall apply:
\- For references to TS 25.141 [10], the method of test is specified in TS
25.141 [10], subclause 6.5.2.1.4.
\- For references to TS 25.142 [12], the method of test is specified in TS
25.142 [12], subclause 6.6.2.1.4.
\- For references to TS 36.141 [9], the method of test is specified in TS
36.141 [9], subclause 6.6.3.4.
NOTE: In this case the test requirements of the present document defined in
subclause 6.6.2.5 apply.
For GSM/EDGE single-RAT requirements, the method of test is specified in TS
51.021 [11], applicable parts of subclause 6.5.1, 6.5.2, 6.6.2 and 6.12.
For test requirements of operating band unwanted emissions using the MSR test
configurations defined in subclause 4.8, the, method of test described in
subclauses 6.6.2.4.1 and 6.6.2.4.2 applies.
##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~
in single-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
1) Connect the signal analyzer to the Base Station antenna connector as shown
in Annex D.1.1.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and to avoid e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
2) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth. For BS operating in multiple bands or non-contiguous
spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be
measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF
Bandwidth or sub block edge.
3) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases with channel set-up according
to clause 5 and subclause 4.9.2.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirement
##### 6.6.2.5.1 Test requirements for Band Categories 1 and 3
For a Wide Area BS operating in Band Category 1 or Band Category 3, the
requirement applies outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition,
for a Wide Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a Wide Area BS operating in multiple bands, it
applies inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For a Medium Range BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Medium Range
BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap.
In addition, for a Medium Range BS operating in multiple bands, it applies
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For a Local Area BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Local Area BS
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap. In
addition, for a Local Area BS operating in multiple bands, it applies inside
any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
Outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, emissions shall not exceed the
maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.2.5.1-1 to 6.6.2.5.1-4 below, where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency
and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the downlink
operating band.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
For a BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with
W~gap~ \ 3GHz
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Frequency | Frequency | Test | Measurement | | offset of | offset of | requirement | bandwidth | | measurement | measurement | (Note 1, 2) | (Note 4) | | filter ‑3dB | filter centre | | | | point, ∆f | frequency, | | | | | f_offset | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0 MHz ≤ ∆f \ 3GHz, BS maximum output power 31 \ 3GHz, BS maximum output power P~max,c~ ≤ 31 dBm

## 7.5 Out-of-band blocking
### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability
The Out-of-band blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer outside the uplink operating band.
The blocking performance requirement applies as specified in the Table
7.5.5.1-1 and Table 7.5.5.2-1.
### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement
The general minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 7.5.1. The co-
location minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 7.5.2.
### 7.5.3 Test purpose
The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at specified frequency bands, without undue
degradation of its sensitivity.
### 7.5.4 Method of test
#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: M~RFBW~ in single-band
operation, see subclause 4.9.1, B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in
multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
In addition, in multi-band operation:
\- For B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the highest
operating band may be omitted
\- For B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the lowest
operating band may be omitted
1) Set up the equipment as shown in Annex D.2.1.
2) Generate the wanted signal according to the applicable test configuration
(see clause 5) using reference measurement channel to the BS under test as
follows:
\- For E-UTRA see Annex A.1 in TS 36.141 [9].
\- For UTRA FDD see Annex A.2 in TS 25.141 [10].
\- For UTRA TDD see Annex A.2.1 in TS 25.142 [12].
\- For GSM see subclause 7.6.2 in TS 51.021 [11] and Annex P in TS 45.005 [6]
for reference channels to test.
#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the BS to transmit with the carrier set-up and power allocation
according to the applicable test configuration(s) (see clause 5).
The transmitter may be turned off for the out-of-band blocker tests when the
frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall inside the
bandwidth of the wanted signal.
2) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals, levels and
the frequency offsets as specified for general test requirements in Table
7.5.5.1-1 and, when applicable, for co-location test requirements in Table
7.5.5.2-1.
3) The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz within
the specified range.
4) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the BS receiver, as defined
in the subclause 7.5.5, for the relevant carriers specified by the test
configuration in subclause 4.8.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connectors, the
following steps shall apply:
5) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where
single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier
activated in the other band.
6) For multi-band tests, the interfering signal shall first be applied on the
same port as the wanted signal. The test shall be repeated with the
interfering signal applied on the other port (if any) mapped to the same
receiver as the wanted signal. Any antenna connector with no signal applied
shall be terminated.
7) Repeat step 6 with the wanted signal for the other band(s) applied on the
respective port(s).
### 7.5.5 Test requirements
#### 7.5.5.1 General out-of-band blocking test requirements
For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
parameters in Table 7.5.5.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
[5], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [4], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS
45.005 [6], Annex P.2.1.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies for each
supported operating band. The in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported operating bands according to Table 7.4.5.1-2 shall be excluded from
the requirement.

#### 7.5.5.2 Co-location test requirements
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of BS
receivers when E-UTRA BS, UTRA, CDMA or GSM/EDGE operating in a different
frequency band are co-located with a BS.
The requirements in this subclause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between the
interfering transmitter and the BS receiver and are based on co-location with
base stations of the same class.
For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
parameters in Table 7.5.5.2-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
[5], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [4], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS
45.005 [6], Annex P.2.1.

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. In this
case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with
the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in subclause 6.6.1 are
valid.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported
on each antenna connector.
### 7.6.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 7.6.1.
### 7.6.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to limit the interference
caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.
### 7.6.4 Method of test
#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: M~RFBW~ in single-band
operation, see subclause 4.9.1, B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in
multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
1) Set up the equipment as shown in Annex D.2.1.
#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in Table 7.6.5.1-1.
For BC2, the parameters in Table 7.6.5.2-1 apply in addition.
2) Set the BS to transmit with the carrier set-up and power allocation
according to the applicable test configuration(s) (see clause 5).
3) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described in
subclause 7.6.5.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
### 7.6.5 Test requirements
#### 7.6.5.1 General test requirements
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.6.5.1-1.
Table 7.6.5.1-1: General spurious emission test requirement
* * *
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement Bandwidth Note 30 MHz ‑ 1 GHz -57

1 GHz ‑ 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
12.75 GHz - 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the UL operating
band in GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz Applies only for Bands 22, 42 and 43. NOTE: The
frequency range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ -10 MHz to F~BW\ RF,_,DLhigh~ + 10 MHz
may be excluded from the requirement. For BS capable of multi-band operation,
the exclusion applies for all supported operating bands. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the excluded frequency
range is only applicable for the operating band supported on each antenna
connector.
* * *
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.6.5.1-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the additional spurious emissions requirements in
subclause 6.6.1.5.5 and in case of FDD BS (for BC1 and BC2) emission shall not
exceed the levels specified for protection of the BS receivers of own or
different BS in subclause 6.6.1.5.4. In addition, the requirements for co-
location with other Base Stations specified in subclause 6.6.1.5.6 may also be
applied.
#### 7.6.5.2 Additional test requirement for BC2 (Category B)
For a BS operating in Band Category 2 when GSM/EDGE is configured and where
Category B spurious emissions apply, the power of any spurious emissions shall
not exceed the limits in Table 7.6.5.2-1.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the limits in Table 7.6.5.2-1 are only
applicable when all supported operating bands belong to BC2 and GSM/EDGE is
configured in all bands.

## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.
### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2], subclauses 7.7.1, 7.7.2 and
7.7.3.
### 7.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused by
the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies with a
specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal.
### 7.7.4 Method of test
#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: In single-band operation:
M~RFBW~ if TC6 is applicable; B~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for other TC, see subclause
4.9.1, Table 5.1-1 and Table 5.2-1. In multi- band operation: B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~
and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~, see subclause 4.9.1.
1) Set-up the measurement system as shown in Annex D.2.3.
2) Generate the wanted signal according to the applicable test configuration
(see clause 5) using reference measurement channel to the BS under test as
follows:
\- For E-UTRA see Annex A.1 in TS 36.141 [9].
\- For UTRA FDD see Annex A.2 in TS 25.141 [10].
\- For UTRA TDD see Annex A.2.1 in TS 25.142 [12].
\- For GSM see subclause 7.7.2 in TS 51.021 [11] and Annex P in TS 45.005 [6]
for reference channels to test.
#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure for general and narrowband intermodulation
1) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals, levels and
the frequency offsets as specified in Table 7.7.5.1-1 and Table 7.7.5.1-2 for
general intermodulation requirement, and Table 7.7.5.2-1 and Table 7.7.5.2-2
for narrowband intermodulation requirement.
2) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the BS receiver, as defined
in subclause 7.7.5.1 and 7.7.5.2, for the relevant carriers specified by the
test configuration in subclause 4.8.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connectors, the
following steps shall apply:
3) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where
single band test configurations shall apply with no carrier activated in the
other band.
4) For multi-band tests, the interfering signal shall first be applied on the
same port as the wanted signal. The test shall be repeated with the
interfering signal applied on the other port (if any) mapped to the same
receiver as the wanted signal. Any antenna connector with no signal applied
shall be terminated.
5) Repeat step 6 with the wanted signal for the other band(s) applied on the
respective port(s).
#### 7.7.4.3 Procedure for additional narrowband intermodulation for GSM/EDGE
The GSM/EDGE MC-BTS receiver intermodulation method of test is stated in TS
51.021 [11], applicable parts of subclause 7.7, shall apply for GSM/EDGE
carriers.
The conditions specified in TS 45.005 [6], Annex P.2.2 apply for the GSM/EDGE
intermodulation requirement.
In addition, for multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the
procedure above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band. Any
antenna connector with no signal applied shall be terminated.
### 7.7.5 Test requirements
#### 7.7.5.1 General intermodulation test requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal, as
specified in Annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Maximum
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges or Maximum Radio Bandwidth edges.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at least twice as
wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset from the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth
gap.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.5.1-1 and 7.7.5.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
[5], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [4], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS
45.005 [6], Annex P.2.2.

#### 7.7.5.2 General narrowband intermodulation test requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal, as
specified in Annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Maximum
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges or Maximum Radio Bandwidth edges.
For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within each supported operating
band, the requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap in case the
sub-block gap is at least as wide as the channel bandwidth of the E-UTRA
interfering signal in Table 7.7.5.2-2. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the gap.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.7.5.2-2. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.5.2-1 and 7.7.5.2-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
[5], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [4], subclause 7.2.
\- For any measured GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS

controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Test Tolerances and Derivation of test
requirements
The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification
using the Test Tolerances defined here. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the
test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum
requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the
following tables.
Test requirements which are included by reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS
25.142[12], TS 36.141[9] or TS 51.021[11] have been calculated within the
referred test specification using the Test Tolerances defined therein.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in subclause 4.1.2.
In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as
defined in this Annex.
