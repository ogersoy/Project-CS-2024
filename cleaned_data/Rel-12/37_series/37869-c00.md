SDDTE Small Data and Device Triggering Enhancements
UEPCOP UE Power Consumption Optimizations
# 4 General
This Technical Report investigates and evaluates the RAN-impacting solutions
that have been proposed by SA2 to address the objectives outlined in the SDDTE
and UEPCOP Building Blocks of the SA2 work item on Machine Type and other
mobile data applications Communications Enhancements. More in general the
report identifies and evaluates mechanisms that enhance the ability of the RAN
to handle traffic profiles comprising small data transfers generated by both
machine-type and non-machine-type devices and applications.
Enhancements in the following areas are investigated in the context of
improving both signalling efficiency and UE power consumption in the presence
of traffic involving small data transfers (with inter-arrival time from
several seconds to many hours):
\- Signalling Overhead Reduction:
\- Improved RRC connection management (establishment, reestablishment,
release) as well as potential mechanisms to support short-lived connections or
connectionless approaches
\- Improved handling of small data during connected mode
\- Associated radio and network (S1AP/RANAP) control plane signalling
optimisations for the above procedures
\- UE Power Consumption:
\- Solutions to lower UE power consumption (as per the service requirements
defined clause in clause 7.1.1 of TS 22.368 and clause 4.3.1 of TS 22.101).
# 5 Solutions for Signalling Overhead Reduction
## 5.1 Optimized RRC connection management
### 5.1.1 Solution 1a. Signalling reduction by RRC message combining
NOTE: This solution is described in TR 23.887 v0.9.0, section 5.1.1.3.7
\"Service Request signalling reduction by RRC message combining\".
The proposed solution reduces the number of RRC messages by combining the
information exchanged between the UE and the network into fewer RRC messages.
The solution is proposed for both LTE and UMTS.
#### 5.1.1.1 RAN aspects
Table 5.1.1.1-1: Qualitative analysis for Solution 1a
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Applicability** | Applicable for both | | | | MT and MO cases. It | | | | allows the | | | | transmission of a | | | | single packet (pair) | | | | or multiple (UL/DL) | | | | packets | | | | | | | | Likely applicable to | | | | RRC Connection Setup | | | | procedure in general | | | | (i.e. irrespective | | | | of small data | | | | applications) | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impacts to radio | There would be | | | protocols** | significant impact | | | | on RRC procedures | | | | for combining RRC | | | | connection | | | | establishment, DRB | | | | setup, SMC. | | | | | | | | Service Request has | | | | to be added to RRC | | | | Connection Request. | | | | RRC Connection Setup | | | | has to contain SRB1 | | | | and DRB | | | | configuration and AS | | | | security parameters. | | | | Normally, DRB | | | | configuration is | | | | encrypted, so some | | | | IEs in this message | | | | need to be partially | | | | encrypted. Since | | | | partial encryption | | | | is foreseen, there | | | | will be impact to | | | | PDCP layer. | | | | | | | | The size limitation | | | | of RRC connection | | | | request should be | | | | considered. | | | | | | | | For LTE, increasing | | | | the size of Msg3 | | | | beyond the current | | | | limits may impact | | | | the MAC layer. The | | | | eNB cannot know in | | | | advance whether the | | | | UE requires Msg3 | | | | with a larger size. | | | | Since it would be | | | | inefficient to | | | | schedule all Msg3 | | | | messages with a | | | | larger size, there | | | | may be a need to | | | | define RACH preamble | | | | groups or use group | | | | B preambles. | | | | | | | | For UMTS, the RRC | | | | CONNECTION SETUP | | | | message cannot be | | | | extended to carry | | | | NAS PDU data, unless | | | | advanced features | | | | like Common E-DCH | | | | are implemented. RRC | | | | Connection Setup | | | | message is | | | | transmitted in TM | | | | which means that | | | | there is no | | | | redundancy or | | | | segmentation at RLC | | | | level. The size of | | | | the RRC Connection | | | | Setup message should | | | | also be considered | | | | as it is transmitted | | | | in UM which means | | | | that there will be | | | | no retransmissions | | | | at RLC level. A | | | | longer message would | | | | reduce the | | | | probability of | | | | successful reception | | | | in the UE. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on | No impact to the | | | Mobility** | mobility. Handover | | | | and cell reselection | | | | in idle mode are | | | | supported. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **AS Security | AS security is | | | impacts** | activated during the | | | | RRC Connection Setup | | | | procedure. | | | | | | | | AS SMC may be | | | | compromised (New | | | | information in | | | | RRCConnSetup message | | | | (DRB config, SMC) | | | | are to be sent using | | | | partial encryption. | | | | Details of partial | | | | encryption are not | | | | clear, and whether | | | | RRC Connection Setup | | | | message needs to be | | | | integrity protected | | | | is not clear.) | | | | | | | | Impacts of modified | | | | AS level security | | | | needs to be analysed | | | | by SA3. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impacts to | Not much impact | | | S1/Iu/X2/Iur | expected (if partial | | | signalling** | encryption is | | | | needed, there might | | | | be some changes to | | | | the S1AP procedure). | | | | Does not reduce | | | | S1/Iu signalling | | | | messages. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact to network | Support of new | | | implementation** | procedures for | | | | paging, random | | | | access, RRC | | | | connection setup, | | | | SMC, DRB setup. | | | | | | | | It is not clear | | | | whether the UE | | | | indicates its | | | | preference to the | | | | network to combine | | | | RRC messages or not. | | | | How does the UE | | | | decide when to | | | | combine RRC | | | | messages? Is this up | | | | to UE implementation | | | | (e.g. if path loss | | | | is not too large) | | | | and/or does the | | | | network configure | | | | the UE (through SIB | | | | broadcast or as part | | | | of Attach/TAU | | | | procedure)? | | | | | | | | Network may need to | | | | fetch UE context | | | | earlier or delay the | | | | establishment | | | | procedure to enable | | | | combining the | | | | messages. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact to UE | Support of new | | | implementation** | procedures for | | | | paging, random | | | | access, RRC | | | | connection setup, | | | | SMC, DRB setup. | | | | | | | | The UE needs to | | | | decide whether to | | | | use RRC message | | | | combining based on | | | | eNB/RNC capability | | | | (and/or path loss). | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on UE Power | From the UE power | | | Consumption** | consumption point of | | | | view, there may not | | | | be big difference | | | | between normal | | | | procedure and | | | | optimized procedure. | | | | Main contributor for | | | | the power | | | | consumption is the | | | | DRX periodicity. | | | | | | | | Combining several | | | | procedures into RRC | | | | connection setup may | | | | cause combined (and | | | | then larger) RRC | | | | messages to be sent | | | | multiple times due | | | | to bad network | | | | coverage (unless the | | | | UE doesn't use the | | | | RRC message combing | | | | procedure in bad | | | | network coverage). | | | | And this may cause | | | | UE to unnecessarily | | | | consume UE power. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on control | Reducing the number | | | plane latency** | of RRC messages may | | | | decrease the latency | | | | on the control | | | | plane, but it may | | | | also cause several | | | | additional HARQ | | | | transmissions due | | | | larger RRC messages | | | | in bad network | | | | coverage (unless the | | | | UE doesn't use the | | | | RRC message combing | | | | procedure in bad | | | | network coverage). | | | | Therefore the impact | | | | on control plane | | | | latency is not | | | | clear. | | | | | | | | It needs to be | | | | checked if the UE | | | | can tolerate the | | | | delay between RRC | | | | Connection Request | | | | and | | | | RRCConnectionSetup | | | | as S1 should be | | | | setup in-between | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on | Might need the | | | System/Spectrum | introduction of RACH | | | efficiency** | preamble groups or | | | | use group B | | | | preambles. | | | | | | | | Increased size of | | | | RRC connection | | | | request message may | | | | result in reduced | | | | uplink coverage. | | | | Also, combining | | | | several procedures | | | | into RRC connection | | | | setup may cause more | | | | frequent connection | | | | failure due to | | | | increased size of | | | | RRC messages (unless | | | | the UE doesn't use | | | | the RRC message | | | | combing procedure in | | | | bad network | | | | coverage, thus | | | | reducing the | | | | applicability). | | | | | | | | Combining RRC | | | | messages will result | | | | in a larger combined | | | | message which might | | | | decrease spectral | | | | efficiency when sent | | | | on SRB0 instead of | | | | SRB1 for instance. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | > **Signalling |** Radio messages**| This solution | | > gain** | | reduces the number | | | | of RRC messages e.g. | | | | due to combining | | | | connection setup, AS | | | | SMC, DRB setup and | | | | measurement | | | | configuration. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | **Bits over the | Combining connection | | | air** | setup, AS SMC, DRB | | | | setup and | | | | measurement | | | | configuration into | | | | one RRC message | | | | could not | | | | significantly reduce | | | | the number of | | | | information bits | | | | signalled by RRC | | | | (apart from the RLC | | | | ACK, RLC/MAC | | | | headers, CRC). | | | | | | | | More bits can be | | | | saved for UMTS due | | | | to: | | | | | | | | - No need to | | | | transmit UE | | | | radio capability | | | | in RRC | | | | Connection Setup | | | | complete | | | | | | | | - No need to send | | | | Initial direct | | | | transfer | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | **S1/Iu interface | This solution does | | | signalling** | not reduce the | | | | number of S1/Iu | | | | messages. No gain | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
### 5.1.2 Solution 1b. Lean Service Request Procedure
NOTE: This solution is described in TR23.887v0.9.0, section 5.1.1.3.9 \"Lean
Service Request Procedure\".
The proposed solution suggests re-using AS security contexts and activating AS
security together with RRC reconfiguration so that RAB setup requires less
signalling.

## 5.2 Control Plane solutions
### 5.2.1 Solution 2a. RRC connection without U-plane radio bearer
establishment
NOTE: This solution covers the RAN aspects of the solutions described in TR
23.887 v0.9.0, section 5.1.1.3.1 \"Use of pre-established NAS security context
to transfer the IP packet as NAS signalling without establishing RRC
security\" and section 5.1.1.3.2 \"Optimised handling of C-plane connection
for Small Data and Device Trigger Transmission without U-plane bearer
establishment in E-UTRAN\", which from RAN point of view are very similar.
This would also cover the RAN aspects of the solution described in section
5.1.1.3.3 \"Small Data Service with T5/Tsp and generic NAS transport\", if the
possible enhancements to avoid establishing DRB (Data Radio Bearer) and use
SRB (Signalling Radio Bearer) for the small data transfer were considered.
The proposed solution aims at optimizing the procedure for transfering a
single higher layer message (e.g. a single IP data packet or a SMS) (and
possibly its response) starting from RRC idle. The solution consists of
piggybacking the IP data packet / SMS (and the response) in control messages,
without establishing U-plane radio bearers. For the MO case, the UL packet and
possible acknowledgment DL packet are conveyed in RRC Connection Setup
Complete/UL Information Transfer and RRC Connection Release/DL Information
Transfer messages respectively. For the MT case, the DL packet and possible
acknowledgment UL packet are conveyed in DL Information Transfer and UL
Information Transfer messages respectively.
#### 5.2.1.1 RAN aspects
Table 5.2.1.1-1: Qualitative analysis for Solution 2a
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Applicability** | Applicable for both | | | | MT and MO in case of | | | | LTE. Probably more | | | | suited for the | | | | transmission of a | | | | single packet | | | | (pair), but it could | | | | also allow the | | | | transmission | | | | multiple (UL/DL) | | | | packets. The entire | | | | procedure will need | | | | to be repeated for | | | | each isolated | | | | packet. This | | | | solution is then | | | | more suitable for | | | | infrequent small | | | | data transfer. | | | | | | | | The solution is not | | | | described for UMTS. | | | | Therefore it is not | | | | clear whether the | | | | solution works for | | | | UMTS or not. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impacts to radio | Additional IE in RRC | | | protocols** | Connection Request | | | | for 'small data | | | | indicator' or | | | | "mo-signalling" for | | | | small data | | | | transmission. | | | | Alternatively the | | | | 'small data | | | | indicator' could be | | | | added to the RRC | | | | Connection Setup | | | | Complete message. | | | | Hence, the RRC | | | | establishment cause | | | | can be set without | | | | restriction (i.e., | | | | not mo-signalling | | | | only). | | | | | | | | New NAS message in | | | | RRC Connection setup | | | | complete/RRC | | | | Connection Release | | | | | | | | For MT, new IE to | | | | provide "small data | | | | flag" in the Paging | | | | message. | | | | | | | | UL Information | | | | transfer message | | | | needs to include an | | | | indication to | | | | trigger RRC | | | | Connection release. | | | | | | | | Embedding IP packet | | | | either directly or | | | | as NAS PDU into RRC | | | | message increases | | | | the complexity at | | | | RRC. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on | Handover cannot be | | | Mobility** | executed without AS | | | | security. Thus, | | | | handover is not | | | | supported in this | | | | solution, unless | | | | handover procedure | | | | is modified. | | | | | | | | However, as UE will | | | | end up in the IDLE | | | | after the whole | | | | cycle, no connected | | | | mode mobility is | | | | expected. | | | | | | | | Cell reselection in | | | | idle mode is | | | | supported. | | | | | | | | It is unclear how | | | | radio link failure | | | | (or failure to | | | | receive higher layer | | | | acknowledgement in | | | | time) will be | | | | handled | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **AS Security | Data transmission on | | | impacts** | SRB1 only with NAS | | | | security, without AS | | | | security activation. | | | | | | | | This is not seen as | | | | an issue. However | | | | impacts of missing | | | | AS level security | | | | need to be analysed | | | | by SA3. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impacts to | Updates of S1AP | | | S1/Iu/X2/Iur | messages are | | | signalling** | expected: | | | | | | | | 1. S1 Downlink NAS | | | | Transfer message | | | | includes "release | | | | command" to release | | | | the RRC Connection. | | | | | | | | 2. S1 paging | | | | includes "small data | | | | flag" for the MT | | | | case so that UE can | | | | start this new | | | | procedure. | | | | | | | | 3. MME needs to | | | | know eNB's | | | | capability of | | | | \"infrequent small | | | | data\" transfer. It | | | | could be configured | | | | by OAM, or indicated | | | | by new \"infrequent | | | | small data\" | | | | transfer capability | | | | in S1 setup | | | | request/eNB | | | | configuration update | | | | message, or | | | | implicitly indicated | | | | by the \"small | | | | data\" and "low | | | | priority small data" | | | | cause value in | | | | initial UE message, | | | | i.e. if the eNB | | | | sends these two new | | | | cause value to the | | | | MME, the eNB is | | | | regarded as support | | | | \"infrequent small | | | | data\" transfer. | | | | | | | | 4. eNB needs to | | | | know which MME is | | | | optimised for MTC | | | | Small Data | | | | Transfers. It could | | | | be configured by | | | | OAM, or by adding | | | | "optimized for MTC | | | | Small Data | | | | Transfers" | | | | indication in S1 | | | | setup response/MME | | | | configuration update | | | | message. | | | | | | | | Impact on | | | | dimensioning of the | | | | S1-C interface due | | | | to additional data | | | | traffic. Use of | | | | reliable control | | | | plane to carry delay | | | | tolerant and | | | | non-critical data is | | | | not efficient. | | | | | | | | Mixing of user plane | | | | data/NAS PDUs and | | | | control signalling | | | | in the same messages | | | | leading to more | | | | complexity in the | | | | eNB and the MME. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact to network | (Although this | | | implementation** | solution is not | | | | completely new, | | | | since it's based on | | | | TAU procedure) it | | | | would lead to | | | | increased processing | | | | requirements/load at | | | | the eNB since ASN.1 | | | | encoding/decoding | | | | needs to handle a | | | | RRC message per each | | | | small data packet. | | | | | | | | "Small data ind" in | | | | UL and "small data | | | | flag" in DL need to | | | | be used by eNB to | | | | not establish DRB, | | | | AS security, and not | | | | configure the UE for | | | | measurement | | | | reporting. | | | | | | | | Impact on eNB | | | | scheduler to | | | | identify and | | | | de-prioritise SRB1 | | | | of these connections | | | | compared SRB1 of | | | | other connections. | | | | This can be seen | | | | necessary if there | | | | are a large number | | | | of devices | | | | generating this type | | | | of traffic. | | | | | | | | At MME new functions | | | | need to be supported | | | | like extract IP | | | | address and TEID | | | | from the EPS Bearer | | | | ID, decrypt the UL | | | | IP packet and form | | | | the GTP-U packet, | | | | and send it to the | | | | S-GW. Encrypt the DL | | | | IP packet and form | | | | the NAS PDU, and | | | | send it to the eNB. | | | | Request the eNB to | | | | fast release the RRC | | | | connection after the | | | | NAS transfer. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact to UE | UE would need to be | | | implementation** | able to handle the | | | | U-plane msg over | | | | C-plane. Also, UE | | | | would need to be | | | | able to | | | | provide/process | | | | small data | | | | indicator/flag. UE | | | | also needs a | | | | mechanism to let the | | | | AS trigger this | | | | procedure at | | | | appropriate times. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on UE Power | From the UE power | | | Consumption** | consumption point of | | | | view, there may not | | | | be big difference | | | | between normal | | | | procedure and | | | | optimized procedure. | | | | | | | | Short-lived RRC | | | | connection would | | | | slightly decrease UE | | | | power consumption by | | | | removing some | | | | message exchange | | | | such as AS SMC, DRB | | | | setup and | | | | measurement | | | | configuration, and | | | | by releasing the | | | | connection | | | | immediately after | | | | data transfer. | | | | However increased | | | | processing for the | | | | encoding/decoding of | | | | RRC messages would | | | | go in the other | | | | direction (increase | | | | UE power | | | | consumption) | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on control | Short-lived RRC | | | plane latency** | connection would | | | | reduce latency for | | | | short data | | | | transmission by | | | | removing some | | | | message exchange | | | | such as AS SMC, DRB | | | | setup and | | | | measurement | | | | configuration. | | | | | | | | However, small data | | | | traffic may | | | | interfere with | | | | control signalling | | | | on the control plane | | | | and lead to | | | | increased latency | | | | for other control | | | | plane messages | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Impact on | Depending on the | | | System/Spectrum | amount of small data | | | efficiency** | and frequency of | | | | transfer, the | | | | solution may | | | | interfere CP message | | | | transfer as small | | | | data are transferred | | | | in SRB1.

### 5.2.2 Solution 2b. Downlink small data transfer using RRC message
NOTE: This solution is described in TR 23.887 v0.9.0, section 5.1.1.3.5
\"Downlink small data transfer using RRC message\".
Similar to Solution 2a, this proposal suggests a control plane solution for
the transfer of single higher layer messages (e.g. a single IP data packet or
a SMS), but focuses on the MT case (from the MME to the UE): the DL packet and
possible acknowledgment UL packet are conveyed in RRC Connection Setup and RRC
Connection Setup Complete messages respectively.

## 5.3 S1-MME connectionless approaches
To reduce the amount of signalling caused by idle-connected mode transitions,
solutions can be defined where small amounts of data can be transferred while
the UE has no NAS signalling connection. Two alternatives are described in TR
23.887. Both alternatives are based on the principle of providing information
to the UE about the bearer end-point(s) of the PDN Connection(s) in the SGW.
One of the differences is the handling of security.
### 5.3.1 Solution 3a. Small Data Fast Path
NOTE: This solution is described in TR 23.887 v0.9.0, section 5.1.1.3.6.2
\"Small Data Fast Path\".
The basic principle of small data fast path solution is to provide information
to the UE about the end point of the PDN connection or its bearer(s) in the
SGW, such as Bearer Resource ID. The baseline approach over the radio
interface is to establish a RRC connection and use DRB for the data transfer
when the UE is about to send a small data packet. The data radio bearer can be
established using the existing mechanisms for establishing a radio bearer (RRC
connection establishment followed by RRC connection reconfiguration), or it
can be configured with the RRC connection setup message, hence omitting the
RRC reconfiguration procedure. Other alternatives are FFS. For all RRC
connections (related to small data fast path transfers) there is no associated
S1-MME signalling (apart from the paging message for the MT case). In this
solution security is performed between the UE and SGW. Security information is
provided by MME to SGW and UE at session creation (details of the security
solution are FFS by SA3).

### 5.3.2 Solution 3b. Connectionless Data Transmission
NOTE: This solution is described in TR23.887v0.9.0, section 5.1.1.3.6.3
\"Connectionless Data Transmission\".
At the first visit of a cell in an eNB (or when the security context for a
cell of an eNB is not known/valid), the UE executes a Service Request
procedure using the legacy procedures: RRC connection is established over the
radio interface together with the associated S1-MME signalling. The UE and the
eNB exchange a token provided by the eNB to be used as a future reference to
the UE context in the eNB. For subsequent data transmissions in the same cell,
the UE can use the connectionless data transmission procedure, i.e.
establishing a RRC connection to send the connection ID+token+signature, and
using the DRB for data transfer. Other alternatives are FFS. For all RRC
connections related to subsequent small data connectionless data transmissions
in the same cell there is no further associated S1-MME signalling. In this
solution the security model is not changed as the eNB performs the encryption
function.

### 5.3.3 Solution 3c. RACH-based Small Data Transmission
This is similar to the connectionless data transmission (solution 3b) but the
small data packet in uplink is transmitted in RRC_Idle state of the UE using
the RACH procedure (see Figure 5.3.3-1). In this solution, there is no change
to the preamble transmission and RA response (Msg-2) of the existing RACH
procedure. In RA message 3 (Msg-3) the UE includes the indication for
connectionless transmission along with the S-TMSI and BSR. In response the UE
receives the contention resolution message (Msg-4) along with the grant to
transmit the small data packet for which BSR was sent in Msg-3. The small data
is transmitted on a default data radio bearer (DRB) which is activated at the
eNB on reception of Msg-3 and at the UE on reception of Msg-4. The default
configuration of DRB is pre-configured at UE and eNB. The default DRB is a
common radio bearer between the UE and eNB for all PDN connections for which
connectionless transmission is enabled. Therefore, for each UL packet
transmitted, the UE includes the gateway identifier (similar to connection ID
in solution 3b) and S-TMSI. The default DRB configuration remains activated
till the timers at UE and eNB are running and there is no need to execute
preamble transmission and Msg-2 exchange if there is subsequent small data
packet to be transmitted.
Figure 5.3.3-1: Solution 3c RACH based Small Data Transmission.
The security functionality is retained between the UE and the eNB and handled
at the PDCP layer. A separate connectionless security context is used by the
UE and eNB when the connectionless transmission mode is enabled. The
connectionless security materials such as Alg-ID, MME nonce, eKSI, etc. are
provided to the UE during initial attach procedure with an associated life
time. The UE uses the connectionless security context and derives the security
key (K~CLT~) for encrypting the small data packet. Along with the encrypted
small data packet the UE passes the eKSI for the first UL transmission. The
eNB requests the MME to derive and pass the security key (K~CLT~) for the
small data protection by providing the eKSI. When the UE is in idle mode, it
uses the established context for the further small data transmissions in the
same cell and till the life time of the key. When the UE moves to connected
mode, the connectionless security context for the small data traffic is
deleted and the UE may follow the existing procedure for establishing the AS
security context.
During connectionless transmission mode, if the lifetime of security key
expires or there is a cell change or PDCP COUNT is about to wrap around, then
the security key is refreshed (for details refer to section 5.7.4.5 of TR
33.868). For key refresh, the only information that the UE needs to generate a
unique key is MME nonce. The UE initiates the RACH procedure for key refresh
and sends the eKSI to eNB. Further steps include eNB-MME exchange on S1-MME
where the MME provides the MME nonce to eNB. The way eNB delivers the DL
packet, the MME nonce is also delivered in same way on PDSCH.

## 5.5 Keep the UE in connected mode
### 5.5.1 Solution 5a. Core Network assisted eNB parameters tuning for small
data transfer
NOTE: This solution is described in TR 23.887 v0.9.0, section 5.1.2.3.1 \"Core
Network assisted eNB parameters tuning for small data transfer\".
In order to minimize UE state transitions, UEs can be kept in connected mode.
The setting of some key parameters like the RRC inactivity timer and the DRX
timers could be assisted by the Core Network. This could be based on initial
values for the parameters provided at attach time or subscription data (e.g.
related to expected mobility pattern, or expected allowed applications
characteristics such as whether only mobile originated services are expected
by the particular application) and/or the learning of the signalling traffic
pattern and/or the mobility pattern of the user. The CN assistance information
can enable the RAN to adjust/optimize the RAN parameters applied to the UE and
thus reduce the frequency of transitions between idle and connected states,
minimize network signalling, and save UE battery consumption.

5.5.2 Solution 5b. Connected mode with UE controlled mobility
For non-stationary UEs, much of the mobility related signalling on the air
interface (i.e. measurement reports, handover signalling) can be avoided by
using UE controlled mobility. In this solution, the option of using UE
controlled mobility in connected mode for UEs with applications generating
small and infrequent data transmissions is enabled. With this, the UE can be
kept in long term connected mode with minimal overall (connection-
establishment plus mobility-related) signalling overhead.
Some necessary optimization needs to be introduced in the current standard to
enable UE controlled mobility:
\- The UE may re-establish the connection potentially in a different cell; the
procedure would succeed as long as the target cell is either prepared (forward
preparation) or able to retrieve the UE context (backwards fetch).
\- Forward preparation of target cell is part of existing handover preparation
procedures. However, this procedure won't be triggered if there is no handover
occurring (e.g. no measurement report in this solution).
\- Backwards fetch of UE context needs to be supported between two eNBs. One
possibility is the reuse of the RLF indication message (see TS 36.423, section
8.3.9.2); however, this procedure is not supported in existing specifications.
The use of RLF indication for this purpose should be further confirmed by
RAN3.
{width="3.83125in" height="5.172916666666667in"}
Figure 5.5.2-1: Signalling sequence to resume DRB upon cell reselection
As per section 5.3.7.5 of TS 36.331, during the re-establishment procedure,
the UE gets all the necessary information to recalculate the security keys and
the nextHopChainingCount value (for subsequent cell changes) in the
RRCConnectionReestablishment message. Thus, with this solution, the sending of
the security mode command (which is one of the largest signalling messages
exchanged during connection setup) is avoided after cell change. It should
also be noted that in this case a RRC Reconfiguration message may not be
necessary if the DRB is not suspended, unlike in re-establishment procedure
due to e.g. RLF or handover failure. This however assumes that a number of
changes are necessary for the re-establishment procedure and that these
changes need to be supported by both the eNB and the UE, i.e. the re-
establishment of SRB2 and DRB through the RRC Connection Reestablishment
message.
In case of very infrequent data transmission, the UE may be subjected to more
cell reselections than data transmission occasions. In this scenario, it would
be beneficial if the UE would attempt the RRC Reestablishment procedure as
proposed above only upon a need for new data transmission (i.e. either new MO
data or paging). In other words, this would also mean that the UE would be
only listening to downlink paging channels for MT data in connected mode (i.e.
the network could potentially at this point tear down the S1-U connection).
This would also minimise the mean power consumption at the UE (i.e. same as
idle mode power consumption).
# 6 Comparison of solutions for Signalling Overhead Reduction
## 6.1 Traffic models
The following scenario shall be considered when evaluating the possible
signalling overhead reduction allowed by the different proposals:
\- Transfer of 100 byte to 1 Kbyte packets in UL and DL with inter-arrival
times from several seconds to many hours
In particular the case of one IP packet pair (1 UL + 1 DL) transmitted every
[30s, 1min, 5min, 10min, 30min] shall be considered.
Furthermore a simple mobility model is assumed where the UE performs a number
of cell changes per minute, in the range from 0 (i.e. stationary UE) to 1
(e.g. 60Km/h with 0.5 Km radius cell).

## 6.3 Signalling overhead of the different solutions
This section provides an estimate of the signalling overhead (mainly on Uu,
but also on S1) of the following SDDTE alternatives:
\- Control Plane solution 2a,
\- S1-MME Connectionless solutions 3a & 3b and
\- Solution 4b \"Optimized Service Request procedure for UEs with a single
bearer\"
The signalling overhead is compared to the legacy solution to move from RRC
idle to RRC connected and then back to RRC idle. The different alternatives
are also compared to the (opposite) approach to always \"keep the UE in
connected\".
Regarding the different SDDTE proposals, it can be noted that, from a RAN
interfaces point of view, solution 4b corresponds to the legacy solution to
move from idle to connected and back and thus it's not separately considered.
To determine the signalling overhead of the suggested enhancements to
establish/release a RRC connection, the considered use case in the following
is the one of a single small UL packet followed by a single small response DL
packet. This is the scenario where the different solutions can show the
maximum signalling reduction gain with respect to the legacy idle-> connected
-> idle approach. In other words, the signalling gain of the different
solutions can only be lower in case multiple packets are sent during the same
connection.

## 6.4 Impact on System Performance
Considering the size of the radio messages for the different alternatives (as
described in Section 6.3) and the assumed traffic/mobility model (as described
in Section 6.1), the radio signalling overhead for transmitting each IP packet
pair (1 UL + 1 DL) can be analytically derived.
Figure 6.4-1 shows the DL radio signalling overhead for the different
alternatives.
NOTE 1: (under the assumption that both the UL and DL packet are transmitted
in the same cell) the overhead for the legacy RRC connection
establishment/release procedure, solution 2a and solution 3a is not affected
by the UE mobility.
NOTE 2: Solution 3b is affected by UE mobility because the first transmission
in a new cell needs to follow the legacy RRC connection establishment/release
procedure. After the initial transmission the required UE context (e.g. the
Token) is assumed to be stored as long as required (i.e. up to 30 minutes in
the considered scenario)
NOTE 3: for both solutions 3a and 3b, the assumption is that the RRC
Connection Reconfiguration message is NOT used.
NOTE 4: for the solution always keeping UEs in connected mode, only the
overhead due to handover signalling is considered (the overhead to establish
the RRC connection at the very beginning is neglected).

Figure 6.4-1. DL signalling overhead per IP packet pair
Figure 6.4-2 shows the S1-MME / X2 overhead for the different alternatives,
considering the number of involved S1-MME / X2 messages.
NOTE 5: More precisely, for the solution always keeping UEs in connected mode
only the X2 overhead is considered in the figure, while for all the other
solutions only the S1-MME overhead is considered (X2 overhead is zero).
{width="6.5465277777777775in" height="3.6458333333333335in"}
Figure 6.4-2. S1-MME/X2 overhead per IP packet pair
From the signalling overhead evaluation for the different alternatives some
straightforward observations can be derived:
**Observation 1:** Due to the mobility signalling overhead, the solution
always keeping UEs in connected mode is not always the best one in terms of
radio signalling overhead. For relatively short IP packet inter-arrival times
(e.g. shorter than 1 minute) the solution is certainly good, even for
moderately high UE speeds (e.g. 1 cell change per minute). For long IP packet
inter-arrival times always keeping UEs in connected mode can lead to high
signalling overhead, also for low mobility UEs (e.g. with IP packet inter-
arrival times longer than 20-25 minutes there would be a signalling overhead
increase also for 0.05 cell changes per minute).
**Observation 2:** When always keeping UEs in connected mode is not
viable/efficient (e.g. due to the impact of mobility signalling for fast
moving UEs), the (legacy) solution to move from RRC idle to RRC connected and
then back to RRC idle can certainly reduce the signalling load.
**Observation 3:** From a pure signalling overhead point of view, SDDTE
solutions for moving from RRC idle to RRC connected and back lead to results
which are either better or equal to the legacy solution (for the considered
use case, e.g. transmission of isolated IP packet pairs).
**Observation 4:** For some SDDTE solution the gain (over legacy
idle/connected/idle transitions) is independent on the UE mobility and the IP
packet pair inter-arrival time, while for other solutions the gain decreases
with increasing UE mobility and IP packet pair inter-arrival time.
Considering the message sequences of the different SDDTE solutions, the
message size estimates shown in Section 6.3 and some additional assumptions
(as in Table 6.4-1 below) it is also possible to estimate the load on the
different channels (PDCCH, PDSCH, PUSCH, etc.) for the different proposals.
Table 6.4-1. Evaluation assumptions
* * *
Parameters Value Packet size (UL and DL) 100 bytes, 1K bytes Packet inter
arrival time 30s, 10min Cell bandwidth 10MHz (50PRBs) PDCCH region length 3

overhead 30% MCS for PDSCH QPSK, Code rate = 0.1 MCS for PUSCH QPSK, Code rate
= 0.1 PRACH Configuration Index 3 Mobility From 0 to 1 cell changes per minute
* * *
Figures 6.4-3 and 6.4-4 show the load on PDCCH, PDSCH and PUSCH depending on
the numbers of UEs in the cell and according to the different alternatives. In
Figure 6.4-3 the IP packet pair inter-arrival time is assumed to be 30s, while
in Figure 6.4-4 it's 10 minutes. Both the figures show the results for two
different packet sizes (in both UL and DL): 100 bytes (left column of the
figures) and 1Kbytes (right column of the figures).

Figure 6.4-4c: PUSCH load. Packet pair IAT = 10min. Left: Pkt size=100bytes,
Right: Pkt size=1Kbytes
Some additional observations can be derived:
**Observation 5:** For large packet sizes (1Kbytes), PDSCH and PUSCH are the
limiting factors and the different solutions show quite similar behaviour. So,
for large packet sizes, all the SDDTE solutions seem to lead to quite limited
benefits on the radio interface (note that, depending on the solutions, there
might still be benefits on the S1-MME interface).
**Observation 6:** For small packet sizes (100 bytes), as already observed
from the signalling overhead analysis, SDDTE solutions show some benefits on
the radio interface when the packet inter-arrival times and the UE mobility
increase. In any case the PDSCH seems still to be the limiting factor (with a
packet pair inter-arrival time of 10 minutes, the most efficient SDDTE
solution shows a performance gain calculated on the PDSCH curve of nearly 50%
compared to the legacy solution to move from idle to connected and then back
to idle).

## 7.4 Power Saving State
### 7.4.1 Solution 4a: Power Saving State
NOTE: This solution is described in TR23.887v0.10.1, section 7.1.3.3 \"Power
Saving State for Devices\".
This solution allows the UE to move to a new power saving state, after an
active time period starting when the UE moves to idle state. In the power
saving state the UE remains attached; however, all AS functionalities stop.
The UE is reachable for DL data during the time that the UE is in RRC/S1
connected state and during the active time period (i.e. via paging). The UE
wakes up - going back to idle state - when it has UL data pending or when it
needs to perform a tracking area update.
Transitions to and from the power saving state are illustrated in Figure
7.4.1-1. When the AS layer is deactivated by the NAS layer, the UE stops all
AS procedures. It has not been evaluated whether the UE could directly move to
the power saving state from the connected state.

definition of a new AS state)

# 9 Conclusions
**On solutions for Signalling Overhead Reduction:**
All the solutions for Signalling Overhead Reduction included in Section 5 have
been analysed, from a qualitative point of view. This has led to the decision
not to further continue the work on a few solutions, e.g. solutions 1a and 2b.
The quantitative aspects (i.e. the corresponding signalling gain) of the
remaining solutions have been investigated. This has shown that, in certain
conditions, some of the solutions do bring some benefits, in terms of
signalling overhead reduction (including on the S1-MME and Iu interfaces) and
also in terms of overall system capacity.
Considering that SA2 has finally decided to discontinue the work (in Rel-12)
on a number of solutions, including the 'S1-MME Connectionless' solutions 3a
and 3b, the discussion finally focussed only on solutions 2a and 5a (and only
for LTE, not for UMTS).
Regarding solution 2a, the following conclusions can be drawn:
The solution could lead to noticeable performance improvements on both the
radio and the S1-MME interfaces only in very specific use cases, specifically
only when all the following conditions are fulfilled:
\- The solution is used for the transmission of isolated bursts of packets,
which means that the transmission of a burst of packets is followed by a
relatively long inactivity period (e.g. at least one minute). If the inter-
arrival time of the packet bursts is shorter, then this solution would provide
worse capacity than legacy solutions as it is more efficient to keep the UEs
in RRC connected mode.
\- The packet burst is made of maximum 2 packets (in total, i.e. considering
both UL and DL packets). If more packets are sent in a burst, the solution
would again provide worse capacity than legacy solutions on both the radio and
the S1-MME interfaces (as this would require the set up / release of a RRC
connection for each packet pair).
\- The packets are small in size (e.g. in the order of hundreds of bytes),
otherwise (i.e. > 1Kbytes per UL/DL message) the gain over the radio would be
lost. And although there would be a reduction in the number of messages on the
S1-MME interface, there would be an increase in the size of such S1 messages.
If this solution will be defined, it will be essential to ensure that only
traffic matching these characteristics makes use of such a solution, since the
use with other traffic patterns would result in capacity and performance loss.
So the UE would need means to distinguish such traffic unambiguously.
The impact of handling user plane traffic in the control plane of an eNB (or
of handling ciphering and buffering in the MME) has not been studied in depth,
but there are some concerns that network nodes were not dimensioned for such
kind of use. There is also impact on the eNB for special handling of this SRB1
in terms of prioritisation.
How much overall gain can be achieved with this solution would also largely
depend on the share that such traffic (small and rare) has on the overall
load. As evaluation has shown, existing solutions can handle several hundred
thousands of UEs per cell generating these traffic patterns (if there is no
other traffic in the cell).
The alternative defined in clause 5.1.1.3.3 of TR 23.887 has not been
specifically discussed. However, if this solution is expected to transfer user
data via SRB1 using the RRC Connection Setup Complete and RRC Connection
Release messages, the above observations for solution 2a may also apply for
the alternative in clause 5.1.1.3.3 of TR 23.887.
Regarding solution 5a, it is believed that the following assistance
information could be useful at the eNB (e.g. to determine a suitable RRC
connection handling, as well as DRX and UL control channel configuration):
a) UE mobility behaviour. This will be possible in LTE Rel-12, where the UE
will be able to provide mobility information upon IDLE=>CONNECTED transitions.
The details of the information may be discussed further in the corresponding
RAN Work Item (on heterogeneous network mobility enhancements). It was
observed that the CN would not know the UE mobility while the UE was IDLE.
b) A description of the traffic type/pattern (e.g. packet inter-arrival time).
However it is unclear whether this information could be obtained reliably. It
was pointed out that a traffic pattern experienced in the past does not
necessarily say too much about the future. For some devices it may be possible
to derive information about the traffic pattern, based on e.g. the
subscription type and then make use of it (e.g. to configure the RRC
connection accordingly or to enable a fast RRC connection release for UEs
which transmit very infrequently). For other devices it may not be possible to
get any reliable information. It could not be assessed whether such
information should come from the CN or directly from the UE. There has also
been no quantification of possible gains.
Other solutions such as provisioning of other assistance information (e.g. an
indication that the UE is stationary, RRC state transitions counts, connection
durations) were not discussed due to lack of time. Therefore, the potential
usefulness and feasibility could not be assessed.
**On solutions for UE Power Consumption Optimization:**
\- Solution 4a ('Power saving state') and solution 1a and 2a (introducing very
long DRX cycles in IDLE or CONNECTED) are expected to have roughly the same
power consumption if the sleep times are equivalent. The transmission of the
periodic TAU consumes more power than just waking up and listening for paging,
but this is assumed to be negligible if periodic TAU is set to several tens of
minutes.
\- Differently from the introduction of DRX cycle values beyond 10.24s (for
LTE), which would have a number of RAN implications, the definition of a
'Power saving state' has very limited impact on the RAN, if transition into
the state is configured/ managed by NAS (however it is unclear how RAN4 would
take the power saving state into account).
\- The 'Power saving state' solution limits the UE reachability to the
configured durations of the periodic TAU (e.g. several tens of minutes) and
would then be applicable to some MTC use cases only. The same restriction
would apply for solutions introducing DRX cycle values leading to similar
sleep times.
\- The definition of extended DRX cycles of up to 10.24s (for LTE) will have
less impacts on the RAN than very long DRX cycles and could be usable for
other use cases than the 'Power saving state'. However, it is still unclear
whether extension up to 10.24s may give substantial power saving opportunity
or may actually result in increased power consumption due to the need for
reading SIB1 before a paging occasion. In any case the extension of DRX cycles
would also have impacts regarding mobility related RAN4 performance
requirements.
