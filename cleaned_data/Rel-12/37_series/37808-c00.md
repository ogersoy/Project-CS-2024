# 4 General
The impact of Passive InterModulation (PIM) on Base Station (BS) receiver
performance has been extensively discussed in RAN4 in relation to the work on
\"Multi-Standard Radio Base Station RF requirements for non-contiguous
spectrum deployments\" (MSR-NC). It has been shown that the degradation
depends on several factors and can in some cases be quite severe (over 10 dB).
It was also concluded that putting requirements only on the BS will not solve
the issue, since PIM can be generated in the complete site infra-structure,
including the antennas. For this reason, the PIM issue needs to be addressed
from a broader BS site and infrastructure point view in a separate study item.
## 4.1 Work item objective
This study investigates the PIM issue from an overall perspective and
concludes on a way forward for the PIM problem and proposes corresponding
requirements for the BS specifications. Primary focus:
1\. Understand the overall PIM mechanism, impact and level of degradation
considering the PIM performance of the complete site infrastructure, including
the BS.
2\. Conclude on reasonable new PIM-related requirements for the BS, set in
relation to the site infra-structure PIM performance. Existing BS RF
requirements and tests remain unchanged. Investigate and define applicability
conditions of new PIM-related requirements.
3\. Consider and develop test methods so that the PIM performance can be
captured and tested properly
The following specification-related work will be required:
1\. In the present document, identify possible site deployment aspects,
possible counter measures and way forward, which should serve as a deployment
guideline.
2\. Identify the corresponding requirements needed and their applicability for
the BS core and test specifications, based upon the outcome of the present
document.
# 5 Scenarios for PIM
## 5.1 Site scenarios
The possibility of interference from PIM in wireless communication system is a
well-known phenomenon. The detailed mechanism behind PIM generation is
described in clause 6. If the interference fall into the receiver band may
cause degradation of receiver sensitivity.
Figure 5.1-1 shows a typical interference scenarios for a BS, where PIM
generated within the site creates potential interference to the BS own
receiver. This is a major interference scenario in broad bandwidth and/or non-
contiguous spectrum operation. It includes two categories: single band
transmission and multi-band transmission sharing the antenna system. The
duplexer, jumper cable, feeder cables, antenna, and the connectors between
them are major potential sources of PIM. Scenarios where interference is
created outside the site or when the interference victim is another BS are not
covered by the present document.
Figure 5.1-1: PIM interference to the receiver of own BS
PIM can also be generated within site equipment that is shared between
operators. The transmitter source causing the PIM can then potentially be
another operator\'s BS sharing the site in the same band or an adjacent band.
## 5.2 Single-band scenarios
Operation of MSR BS in Non-Contiguous spectrum (MSR-NC) enables transmission
on carriers with a large frequency separation within a band, potentially
giving very high RF bandwidths. Considering the frequency domain relations for
the generation of passive InterModulation (IM) products, the existing paired
bands can be divided into two categories. For the first category, the relation
between band size and duplex gap size implies that third order PIM products
would never fall in the own receive band, irrespective of RF BW. For the
second category of bands, due to the \"small\" duplex gap, the own receiver
could potentially suffer sensitivity degradation from IM3 products, depending
on the size of the RF BW. Table 5.2-1 summarizes the IM3 analysis for the
paired bands, while Table 5.2-2 gives the maximum RF BW which would not cause
IM3 in the own receiver for the concerned bands. Note that there are
additional new bands under standardization such as band 26, 27 and 700 APAC,
which also could suffer from passive IM3 into own Rx.
The maximum RF BW without IM3 in own receive band is equal to the UL-DL
separation divided by 2, as given in Table 5.2-2. For higher order 5^th,^
7^th^ and 9^th^ order PIM, the maximum RF BW without IM in own receive band is
equal to the UL-DL separation divided by 3, 4 and 5 respectively. As is noted
later in the present document, the higher order PIM processes also contribute
to the IM products at the frequencies of lower order products.
One additional aspect for MSR-NC in multi-RAT operation is that for narrowband
systems such as GSM, the IM products are also narrowband, while the IM
products from wide band carriers or combination of wideband and narrowband
carriers in multi-RAT operation will be broadband. Due to the broadband nature
of PIM for multi-RAT transmissions and the fact that the PIM level possibly
increases with the number of carriers, single-RAT features that rely on
narrowband properties such as GSM frequency hopping will not be a solution to
the PIM problem.
Thus, MSR-NC is clearly a relevant scenario for the PIM studies.

Based on RAN4 decision, NC-HSDPA and NC-CA are developed for both MSR 3GPP TS
37.104 [5] and single RAT specifications (3GPP TS 25.104 [3] and 3GPP TS
36.104 [4]). This means that single RAT aspects of non-contiguous operation
PIM should be considered and handled in the corresponding specification.
## 5.3 Multiband scenarios
### 5.3.1 Dual band HSDPA, LTE inter-band CA and MB-MSR
There are currently a large number of band combinations supporting dual band
HSDPA and/or LTE CA which are either already defined or under standardization
in 3GPP.
In previous RAN4 work, the potential for harmonics and intermodulation
generation of a number of inter-band CA combinations were discussed. Thus dual
band HSDPA and LTE inter-band CA are also relevant scenarios for PIM.\ The
exact combinations to handle will require further investigation.
Similar with dual band HSDPA and LTE inter-band CA, MB-MSR are also relevant
scenarios for PIM. As long as BS transmits through one common antenna
connector for multiband scenarios, the PIM interference may cause receiver
sensitivity degradation of another co-located BS or own BS.
For the case interference to another co-located BS, the existing emission
requirements for co-location with other BSs, i.e. -96 dBm/100KHz still works
well, but is not included in present study. For the case interference to the
receiver of own BS, the requirement and test require further investigation.
While co-location is not part of the present study, there are scenarios where
site equipment is shared between co-located operators. This is the case for
indoor systems, especially in public places such as railway stations, where it
is common that all operators share the same distributed antenna system over a
multi-operator combiner. Within a band or for bands that are close to each
other, shared infrastructure can generate PIM into the receiver, where the
transmitter source causing the PIM can then potentially be another operator\'s
BS sharing the site in the same band or an adjacent band.
## 5.4 Other scenarios
All other scenarios where PIM generation occur due to circumstances external
to the site infra-structure are beyond RAN4 study areas and are not included
in the study item.
Active Antenna Systems (AAS) are not within the scope of the present study.
# 6 PIM generation from site infra-structure
## 6.1 Mechanism for PIM generation
With introduction of MSR in non-contiguous spectrum, there are new
implications for the RF characteristics. These are related to the extension of
the RF bandwidth to cover non-contiguous spectrum scenarios, plus the
combination of carriers with narrowband/high Power Spectral Density (PSD) and
broadband /low PSD carriers for the different RATs. One of the most
challenging implications is the possible generation of Passive InterModulation
(PIM) products into the own receive band, which could degrade the receiver
sensitivity due to the resulting noise increase.
There are additional scenarios relevant to BS PIM, considering recent features
added to 3GPP specifications. For dual band HSDPA and inter-band CA for
E-UTRA, there are band combinations that would potentially cause PIM into own
receive band. In addition, the new work item for multi-band MSR BS with
potentially very wide band transmitters and receivers would lead to new PIM
scenarios.
Passive InterModulation (PIM) occurs due to the non-linear nature of passive
components and has traditionally been a major concern when deploying cellular
networks. Nonlinearities will always be present in components and interfaces
due to material imperfections, and highlights the needs for high-quality
materials and finishes. For GSM networks, PIM was handled initially through
non-duplexed equipment, which gives at least 30 dB isolation between RX and
TX.\ For duplexed equipment, it is handled through frequency planning and
frequency hopping. For broadband systems such as UTRA, that have limited RF
BW, the lower order IM products do not hit the own receive band and carriers
have low PSD. For these reasons, the passive IM does not contribute to any
degradation of the receiver. The situation becomes different for wider RF BW
in combination with high PSD carriers.
PIM products can be generated from the antenna port of the duplexer in the BS,
through connectors, jumper cable, feeder cables, site equipment and antennas,
all the way up to and including the antennas, as shown in figure 6.1-1. Some
of the mechanisms behind passive IM generation are as follows:
● Corrosion, oxides (due to aging, i.e., can vary over time)
● Dissimilar metals in contact to each other
● Magnetic or paramagnetic materials in the signal path
● Sharp edges in connectors, causing corona generation
● Defects in workmanship
● Low contact pressure and small contact area
● Debris, pollution and dust at the contact areas
● Vibration
● Temperature variation
Figure 6.1-1: PIM and PIM generation path
InterModulation (IM) products occur at frequencies $| \pm \text{mf}_{1} \pm
\text{nf}_{2}|$where the order of IM products is (_m_ +_n_).\ The third order
IM products have the highest level, while the level gradually decreases for
higher order products.
Considering the frequency domain relations for the generation of IM products,
the existing paired bands can be divided into two categories. For the first
category, the relation between band size and duplex gap size implies that IM3
products would never fall in the own receive band, irrespective of RF BW. For
the second category of bands, due to the \"small\" duplex gap, the own
receiver could potentially suffer sensitivity degradation from IM3 products,
depending on the size of the RF BW. Note that there are additional new bands
under standardization such as band 26, 27 and 700 APAC, which also could
suffer from passive IM3 into own Rx. Higher-order PIM may have to be
considered for cases where 3^rd^ order PIM is not a problem, see clause 5.2.
The IM products are thus dependent on several parameters such as:
● Number of transmitted carriers
● Type of carrier (modulation, amplitude components of the carrier (peak to
average),\ bandwidth, output power per carrier type)
● Frequency relation between carriers.
● Total RF Bandwidth of the transmitted multicarrier signal
The impact of PIM can depend on frequency and can be higher at lower
frequencies. One reason for this is that the PIM source is often not located
close to the point of the input signal and will experiences frequency
dependent losses, for example in the antenna feeder. At the PIM source, e.g.
antenna, the signal level will be lower at higher frequencies and therefore
there will be less impact compared to lower frequencies.
In praxis PIM does normally not increase with third order as predicted by
theory. Usually PIM increases with less than 3 dB for every 1 dB change in
input signal level. This is as PIM sources are often not localised at one
point and the overall PIM effect can be rather complex.
A theoretical background for PIM is given in sub-clause 6.1.1:
### 6.1.1 Theoretical background for 3^rd^ order Passive InterModulation (PIM)
When non-linear relationship exists between current and voltage (or,
conversely, between the electric and magnetic components of a propagating
wave), harmonic frequencies and linear integral combinations of them will be
generated. As an illustration, consider a component with a voltage-current
relationship given by
$V = a_{0} + a_{1}I + a_{2}I^{2} + a_{3}I^{3} + \text{.}\text{.}\text{.}$ (1)
and let the current be of the form
$I(t) = I_{1}\text{cos}\omega_{1}t + I_{2}\text{cos}\omega_{2}t$ (2)
where w~i~ = 2$\pi$f~i~ and f~i~ represents the frequency in Hertz. An
interpretation of (1) is that $V$is the result when a signal $I$is applied to
a network characterized by the $a_{i}$ terms. The $a_{i}$ terms thus represent
both the physical properties of the non-linearity and the circuit impedances
in which the non-linearity is embedded. Concentrating on the third-order term
we find:
$V(t) = \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} + a_{3}\begin{matrix} \left\lbrack
\frac{3I_{1}}{2}(\frac{I_{1}^{2}}{2} + I_{2}^{2})\text{cos}\omega_{1}t +
\frac{3I_{2}}{2}(I_{1}^{2} + \frac{I_{2}^{2}}{2})\text{cos}\omega_{2}t +
\frac{I_{1}^{3}}{4}\text{cos}3\omega_{1}t +
\frac{I_{2}^{3}}{4}\text{cos}3\omega_{2}t \middle| \right\rbrack\left\lbrack +
\frac{3I_{1}^{2}I_{2}}{4}\text{cos}(2\omega_{1} - \omega_{2})t +
\frac{3I_{1}^{2}I_{2}}{4}\text{cos}(2\omega_{1} + \omega_{2})t \middle|
\right\rbrack \ \ \end{matrix}$ (3)
In this expression we notice the presence of the harmonics 3ω~1~ and 3ω~2~ as
well as the sums and differences (2ω~1~ ± ω~2~) and (2ω~2~ ± ω~1~). These sums
and differences are commonly referred to as third order intermodulation
products.\ If the Taylor series is limited to 3^rd^ order non-linearities
(a~1~, a~3~ ≠0), it predicts only IM3 products with a \'\'1 dB - 3 dB\' power
relation. This means a 1 dB increase of carrier power results in a 3 dB
increase of IM3 power.
However, the fifth, seventh, ninth and higher order terms also produce these
same \"third order\" intermodulation frequencies. This can be proven
mathematically by writing the higher order term as the product of two lower
order terms. The expansion for the fifth order term is shown below:
$\begin{matrix} a_{5} \cdot \left( I_{1}\text{cos}(\omega_{1}t) +
I_{2}\text{cos}(\omega_{2}t) \right)^{5} = \ a_{5} \cdot \left(
I_{1}\text{cos}(\omega_{1}t) + I_{2}\text{cos}(\omega_{2}t) \right)^{2} \cdot
\left( I_{1}\text{cos}(\omega_{1}t) + I_{2}\text{cos}(\omega_{2}t) \right)^{3}
= \ a_{5} \cdot \left\lbrack \frac{I_{1^{2}}}{2} + \frac{I_{2^{2}}}{2} +
\frac{I_{1^{2}}}{2} \cdot \text{cos}(2\omega_{1}t) + \frac{I_{2^{2}}}{2} \cdot
\text{cos}(2\omega_{2}t) + I_{1} \cdot I_{2} \cdot \left(
\text{cos}(\omega_{1} - \omega_{2})t + \text{cos}(\omega_{1} + \omega_{2})t
\right) \right\rbrack \cdot \ \ \ \end{matrix}\begin{matrix} \left\lbrack
\frac{3I_{1}}{2}\left( \frac{I_{1}^{2}}{2} + I_{2}^{2} \right) \cdot
\text{cos}\omega_{1}t + \frac{3I_{2}}{2}\left( I_{1}^{2} + \frac{I_{2}^{2}}{2}
\right) \cdot \text{cos}\omega_{2}t + \frac{I_{1}^{3}}{4} \cdot
\text{cos}3\omega_{1}t + \frac{I_{2}^{3}}{4} \cdot \text{cos}3\omega_{2}t
\middle| \right\rbrack \ \ \end{matrix}$ (4)
Making use of the trigonometric identity,
$\text{cos}(x) \cdot \text{cos}(y) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \text{cos}(x + y) +
\text{cos}(x - y) \right)$, (5)
it is readily apparent which products in equation (4) produce distortion at a
given frequency. For instance, for a non-linearity with a third and a fifth
order term, the component at frequency (2ω~1~- ω~2~) is given by
$\left{ \begin{matrix} \left. \ a_{3} \cdot \frac{3I_{1}^{2}I_{2}}{4} \middle|
\right} \ \end{matrix} \middle| \right.\ \cdot \text{cos}(2\omega_{1} -
\omega_{2})t$ (6)
At small signal levels it is common practice to ignore the higher order
coefficients. By simplifying the formula, i.e., by assuming that only _a_ ~3~
is non-zero, it is evident from equation (6) that the intermodulation power at
frequency (2ω~1~- ω~2~) increases by 2 dB per dB with signal amplitude _I_ ~1~
and by 1 dB per dB with signal amplitude _I_ ~2~. However, at the high signal
levels where passive intermodulation is problematic, this simplification is no
longer valid. It is evident from equation (6) that when _a_ ~5~ and higher
order coefficients are non-zero, the relation between signal and
intermodulation power is quite complex and depends on all coefficients in the
power series. This explains why the slope of the measured PIM power versus
signal power curve deviates from the \"theoretical\" value and is different
for each passive non-linearity. Papers have suggested use of hyperbolic
tangent or arc-tangent functions with adapted coefficients to describe these
effects, but have not provided additional insight.
Equation (6) also illustrates the problem of computing the relationship
between PIM power for modulated signals versus Continuous Wave (CW) signals.
With modulated signals, the envelopes _I_ ~1~ and _I_ ~2~ are time-varying,
statistical variables. With only _a_ ~3~ non-zero, the average power
(amplitude-squared) of the intermodulation product at frequency (2ω~1~- ω~2~)
is proportional to the fourth moment of _I_ ~1~ and the second moment of _I_
~2~, where the _n_ -th moment of _I_ is defined as the average of _I^n^_. Note
that the second moment of the envelope equals the signal power. Thus, with
only _a_ ~3~ non-zero, the power of the intermodulation product at frequency
(2ω~1~- ω~2~) does not depend on the modulation of the signal at frequency
ω~2~. However, when _a_ ~5~ and higher order coefficients are non-zero, higher
order moments become relevant in the relation between modulation type and
intermodulation power. For instance, for a non-linearity with up to fifth
order terms, up to the eighth order moment of _I_ ~1~ and the sixth order
moment of _I_ ~2~ are relevant at the given intermodulation frequency.
Although the frequency term cos(2ω~1~- ω~2~) in equation (6) does not depend
on the order of the non-linearity, it should be noted that the envelopes _I_
~1~ and _I_ ~2~ contribute their own modulation spectrum to the
intermodulation product. Thus even the shape of the intermodulation product at
a \"third order\" intermodulation frequency depends on the higher order non-
linear coefficients.
The above analysis demonstrates that simulations of PIM power are of
questionable value without accurate determination of the higher order
coefficients of the non-linearity. An abstract intermodulation model could be
substituted for the physical model suggested by (1), but the above analysis
demonstrates that the generality of the model cannot be guaranteed. The
analysis also demonstrates that there is no universally valid relationship
between signal powers, signal modulations and PIM power.
Two possible approaches are recommended for any further empirical
investigation:
1\. Characterize several types of passive non-linearities over a wide range of
CW powers and fit the non-linear coefficients in a simulation model to the
measurements. Next, use these fitted coefficients in a simulation model with
modulated signals.
2\. Characterize several types of passive non-linearities with CW signals as
well as with modulated signals.
The advantages of the first approach are that relatively accurate measurements
can be performed with standardized measurement equipment and that the effect
of modulation can be studied by simulation. The disadvantage is that it is
difficult to judge the effect of estimation errors in the non-linear
coefficients and of truncating the non-linearity power series. The advantage
of the second approach is that it measures the conversion factor between
modulated and CW signals directly.
However for practical approach it is helpful to start with a formula for the
upper bound.
In general, for the complete series expansion, all higher harmonics as well as
their sums and differences, i.e. frequencies of the form
$| \pm \text{mf}_{1} \pm \text{nf}_{2}|$ (7)
would appear, where m and n are positive integers. These frequencies are
referred to as intermodulation products of order (\|m\|+\|n\|). Thus, the
spurious signals due to the third-order term are intermodulation products of
order three. Equation (3) also demonstrates that, for equal amplitudes I~1~
and I~2~, the power of the third-order intermodulation signal will increase,
at least theoretically, with the third power of the transmitted signal
strength. Intermodulation products where \|m-n\|=1 have the potential to be
particularly troublesome.
Third order intermodulation products are formed from the sum and difference
frequencies. In this expression, we notice four intermodulation products with
order three:
For the difference frequencies we have:
Amplitude of $w_{a} = \text{log}(3a_{3}I_{1}^{2}\frac{I_{2}}{4}) =
\text{log}(3\frac{a_{3}}{4}) + 2\text{log}I_{1} + \text{log}I_{2}$\ Amplitude
of $w_{c} = \text{log}(3a_{3}I_{1}\frac{I_{2}^{2}}{4}) =
\text{log}(3\frac{a_{3}}{4}) + \text{log}I_{1} + 2\text{log}I_{2}$
For the sum frequencies we have:
Amplitude of $w_{b} = \text{log}(3a_{3}I_{1}^{2}\frac{I_{2}}{4}) =
\text{log}(3\frac{a_{3}}{4}) + 2\text{log}I_{1} + \text{log}I_{2}$\ Amplitude
of $w_{d} = \text{log}(3a_{3}I_{1}\frac{I_{2}^{2}}{4}) =
\text{log}(3\frac{a_{3}}{4}) + \text{log}I_{1} + 2\text{log}I_{2}$
The second and the third terms above are the amplitude of the fundamental
signals $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ respectively.\ If $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are both
increased by 1 dB, the levels of all third order intermodulation products are
increased by 3 dB.\ However, if $I_{1}$ is kept constant and $I_{2}$ is
increased by 1 dB, then$w_{a}$ and $w_{b}$\ increases by 1 dB while $w_{c}$
and $w_{d}$ increases by 2 dB. Similarly, if $I_{2}$ is kept constant and
$I_{1}$ is increased by 1 dB then $w_{a}$ and $w_{b}$increases by 2 dB while
$w_{c}$ and $w_{d}$ increases by 1 dB.
### 6.1.2 Theoretical bound for higher order non-linearity
Higher order non-linearity (5^th^, 7^th^, 9^th^... order) can be treated in a
similar way as in clause 6.1.1 equation 3.
5^th^ order non-linearity (a~1~, a~5~ ≠0, a~3~ =0) leads to IM3 and IM5
products. In this case both IM3 and IM5 follow a 1 dB - 5 dB relation. In the
standard case with 3^rd^ + 5^th^ order coefficients, the power dependency of
IM3 products is determined by the coherent superposition of both effects.
Therefore deviations from the 1 dB - 3 dB relations in both directions are
possible. In any case, at sufficiently small power levels 3^rd^ order
nonlinearity dominates the PIM results. Hyperbolic tangent or arc-tangent
nonlinear functions with adapted coefficients are a possibility to approximate
these effects.
### 6.1.3 Theoretical background for spread spectrum signals
In this clause the influence of modulation of carriers on the PIM result is
investigated. Spread spectrum carriers were simulated by a multi tone signal
which is a good approximation for LTE and WCDMA for PIM calculation.
Analytical calculations for 3^rd^ and 5^th^ order as well as MatLab
simulations predict an increase of PIM compared to the two tone CW scenario.
This \'\'conversion factor\' depends on the shape of the nonlinearity curve.
For 3^rd^ order non-linearity the factor is exactly **3 dB** for infinite
number of sub tones. This means that if a 2 × 43 dBm CW scenario is replaced
by a 2 × 43 dBm spread spectrum scenario the power integrated over the whole
IM3 BandWidth (BW) is doubled. For the 3^rd^ order nonlinearity, the IM3
bandwidth is three times higher than the carrier bandwidth. Simulation results
are shown in Figure 6.2.3-1. For higher order nonlinearities, the IM3
bandwidth can extend even further.

Figure 6.1.3-1: Matlab simulation: PIM of spread spectrum carrier for 3^rd^
order non-linearity
As the own receiver is the PIM victim, it is more realistic to integrate PIM
power over carrier BW bandwidth only. For this definition the theoretical
3^rd^ order \'conversion factor\' reduces to **1.8 dB**.
The reason for increased PIM for spread spectrum carriers compared to CW
Carriers is an increased PAR (peak to average ratio) of modulated signals.
This leads to the rule that reductions in the \'1 dB - 3 dB relation\' leads
to a reduced \'conversion factor\'.
## 6.2 Measurements

carried out by several companies.

measurements and WCDMA measurements is shown in figure 6.2.1-1.

### 6.2.2 Two tone measurement results
Two tone Constant Wave (CW) measurements for different combinations of power
levels of both carriers are reported in [6]. The PIM source used was a
standard PIM source (IM3 = -80 dBm at 2 × 43 dBm). Results are shown in
figures 6.2.2.1 to 6.2.2.-3. The solid line represents a theoretical 3^rd^
order calculation. As expected these curves match very well to measured data
for low carrier powers. At higher power levels (P~1~ + P~2~ > ∼33 dBm),
measured PIM levels are smaller than the simple 3^rd^ order theory predicts.
This indicates that the true \'conversion factor\' for WCDMA will also be
slightly lower than theory.

For IM5, the degradation of 1 dB - 5 dB relation, more pronounced than for
IM3. The absolute levels of IM5 and IM7 are significantly lower than IM3
(measured: -37 dB for IM5 and -64 dB for IM7 at 2 x 43 dBm). The reported
results can be generally accepted. Similar results are reported by Huawei and
Kaelus [6]. Figure 6.2.2-4 shows a Kathrein measurement using specially
prepared BS antennas.

### 6.2.3 Spread spectrum measurement results
For comparison of spread spectrum signals with CW measurements, two Remote
Radio Heads (RRH) were used in the measurement set up of figure 6.2.1-1. The
RRHs could transmit either WCDMA or CW signals. A conversion factor of **1.7
dB** was observed for IM3 with an estimated measurement error of ±0.5 dB
(figure 6.2.3-1). As expected, this result is lower than the theoretical
values. The conversion factor for IM5 is 3.2 dB in accordance with a measured
1 dB - 3.7 dB power relationship [6].

The strength of the IM products depends on the source of the InterModulation
(IM). Kathrein investigated antennas, combiners and connectors & cables.
The relation between IM3, IM5 and IM7 varied from 10 dB to 30 dB for different
arrangements. These results are representative for antenna products.
The Taylor series as model for the nonlinearly behaviour leads to the result,
that higher order IM products will increase faster with power than IM3. There
will be expected the same level of higher order IM compared to IM3 at a
certain high power. Nevertheless, Kathrein never observed this for real
products.
The limits of measurement configuration did not allow signal strengths higher
than 47 dBm per carrier (50 dBm in sum). However the curves suggest that there
is a saturation. This is logical, as the sum power of all IM products cannot
exceed the limit to the sum of the input power in contradiction to the
unlimited theoretical Taylor model
### 6.2.5 Discussion of the measurement results
Comparison of theoretical results with several measurements showed that the
theory explains the problem with sufficient precision.
The upper limit for a conversion factor is 3dB for 3^rd^ order nonlinearity
(PIM measurement BW = 3 times carrier BW). For the realistic case with the
same BW for aggressor and victim, the conversion factor reduces from 3 dB to
1.8 dB. The conversion factor can be decreased by some tenths of dB for high
power levels as measurements have showed.\ A conversion factor of 2.1 dB is a
realistic assumption.
# 7 PIM impact on receiver performance
Considering the frequency domain relations for the generation of IM products,
given the declared maximum RFBW and allocation of carriers, the IM3 products
could potentially fall in own receive band as noise. For narrowband systems
such as GSM, the IM products are also narrowband, while the IM products from
wide band carriers or combination of wideband and narrowband carriers in
multi-RAT operation will be broadband as shown in figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1: PIM impact on own receive band
To demonstrate a simple example calculation of possible PIM impact on
reference sensitivity, we consider the following assumptions which apply to a
Wide Area (WA) BS deployment:
● Carrier power 2 × 43 dBm UTRA carriers
● Receiver Noise figure: 5 dB
● A conversion factor of 2.1 dB to convert the CW to UTRA modulation.\ The
conversion factor is a conservative average value based on empirical studies
[2].
● Third order PIM performance of e.g. antenna: -150 dBc @ 2 × 43 dBm CW
Note that the conversion factor is an assumption used to derive the
requirements and once the requirements are settled, the conversion factor in
itself would have no further relevance. There would then be an agreed
requirement that defines the PIM performance.
Based on the assumptions, the power of third order PIM products is 43-150=
-107 dBm CW while the power of UTRA modulated PIM product would be -107 dBm +
2.1 dB (conversion factor) = -104.9 dBm /UTRA carrier BW.
Considering the noise floor of -103 dBm and the PIM level of -104.9 dBm (both
normalized over a UTRA channel), the sensitivity degradation would be on the
order of \~2 dB.
In order for the PIM level calculated above to occur, a scenario would be
required where both carriers are transmitted at maximum level, frequency
domain condition of centre frequency of the receiver that fulfils the criteria
of 2f1‑f2 MHz, and also operation of the BS in a band that would potentially
suffer from PIM which makes this a kind of worst case scenario.
For lower carrier powers, it can be assumed that passive IM3 products increase
or decrease by 3 dB when the carrier power is increased or decreased by 1 dB.
A similar analogy can be used for higher carrier powers. Note that in
practice, the PIM products do not strictly follow this theoretical behaviour,
where both lower and higher ratios for the increase/decrease are regularly
observed in practical measurements.
The third order passive intermodulation products have the highest level while
for higher order intermodulation, the PIM level decreases and thus, the focus
here is on the third order PIM.
Due to strong similarities between UTRA and E-UTRA waveforms, the conversion
factor as well as calculations can be assumed to also apply to E-UTRA.
A reasonable level of PIM requirement on the BS (similar to levels defined for
the antennas) is desirable, which in addition to other mitigation schemes
should be sufficient to handle PIM if and when it occurs.
The above analysis applies to Wide-Area base stations based on typical power
levels and IM performance of typical antenna and feeder systems. MR and LA
deployments diverge from this discussion on the following points:
\- Carrier power
3GPP TS 25.104 [3] defines the Medium Range BS class as having a rated output
power of [\ 2 carriers become more common.
### 10.1.2 Integrated PIM measurement
BSs may provide integrated means for characterizing the PIM performance of
antenna and feeder systems.\ These systems maybe preferred over external
systems as PIM is characterized with operational signal types and power levels
in the system as installed. Integrated PIM measurement also has the advantage
that it can be integrated with the product\'s alarm and monitoring system, so
it can be invoked from a central maintenance site as-needed.
# 11 Summary and conclusion
Within the MSR-PIM study a range of issues and aspects has been discussed and
concluded. The mechanisms behind PIM generation, deployment scenarios as well
as counter measures were studied. It was also concluded that all equipment
within the site infra-structure could potentially contribute to PIM.
To study the PIM impact on receiver performance, extensive discussion and
empirical studies were performed to conclude on the conversion factor between
CW and modulated signal and the wanted signal level. Evaluation examples of
PIM impact on receiver performance were also provided.
Additional scenarios such as MB-MSR were also discussed, based on work items
starting after the PIM study.
The main focus of the study concerned third order PIM products, discussions
and empirical measurements on higher order PIM products were conducted,
resulting in the conclusion that the third order PIM products have the highest
level. In some bands the receive band can potentially get a direct hit from
third order PIM, but there are other bands without third order PIM issues
where there is a potential for higher order PIM products to hit the receiver.\
There is therefore a need to also consider higher order PIM for these
additional bands.
There is currently no test coverage in existing conformance specifications
that captures the BS PIM performance.\ After long discussions on a possible
new PIM sensitivity requirement, the need for this new requirement, the
related testing and a possible requirement level, no consensus was reached on
these aspects.
