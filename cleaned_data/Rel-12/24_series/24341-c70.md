# 4 Overview of SMS over IP functionality
## 4.1 Introduction
SMS over IP functionality provides the UE with the capability of sending
traditional short messages over IMS network. The architecture for SMS is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3] and for SMS over IP functionality in 3GPP TS
23.204 [5].
## 4.2 SMS over IP
In order to guarantee SMS interoperability the SM-over-IP sender, the SM-over-
IP receiver and the IP-SM-GW shall support encapsulation of RPDUs defined in
3GPP TS 24.011 [8], subclause 7.3. The SM-over-IP sender, the SM-over-IP
receiver and the IP-SM-GW shall use the MIME type \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\"
for this purpose.
## 4.3 Application utilisation of SMS over IP
SMS over generic IP access can be used to support all applications and
services that use SMS.
## 4.4 SMS over IP and subscription without MSISDN
When SMS over IP is to be delivered to a subscriber where the subscription
profile does not contain an MSISDN, then there is a need for the IP-SM-GW to
become aware of the IMSI during IMS registration for later correlation of
short messages. In order to do so the IP-SM-GW derives the IMSI from the
private user identity of the user that the UE includes in the REGISTER request
at registration or if the private user identity is not available, derives the
IMSI from the public user identity.
3GPP TS 23.003 [22] defines the relationship between the private user identity
and the IMSI and the relationship between the public user identity and the
IMSI.
# 5 SIP related procedures
## 5.1 Introduction
## 5.2 Functional entities
### 5.2.1 User Equipment (UE)
To be compliant with short message over IP in this document, a UE shall
implement:
a) the role of an SM-over-IP sender as specified in subclause 5.3.1.1,
subclause 5.3.1.2, and subclause 5.3.1.3;
b) the role of an SM-over-IP receiver as specified in subclause 5.3.2.1,
subclause 5.3.2.2, subclause 5.3.2.3, subclause 5.3.2.4, and subclause
5.3.2.5; or
c) the roles described in item a) and item b).
To be compliant with short message over IP in MSISDN less operation in this
document, a UE shall implement:
a) the role of an SM-over-IP sender as specified in subclause 5.3.1.4.1,
subclause 5.3.1.4.2, and subclause 5.3.1.4.3;
b) the role of an SM-over-IP receiver as specified in subclause 5.3.2.6.1,
subclause 5.3.2.6.2, subclause 5.3.2.6.3, and subclause 5.3.2.6.4; or
c) the roles described in item a) and item b).
A mechanism for the home operator to configure the UE to use SMS over IP is
given in 3GPP TS 24.167 [8A]. Additional parameters such as the PSI of the SC
of the SM-over-IP sender can be obtained from the UICC as per 3GPP TS 31.103
[18] and 3GPP TS 31.102 [19] if used or from the SIM as per 3GPP TS 51.011
[20] if used.
NOTE: The capability of sending short messages over IP does not affect current
limitations, thus the UE is limited to send at most one UE originated SM and
to receive at most one UE terminated SM at a time.
### 5.2.2 Application Server (AS)
To be compliant with short message over IP in this document, an AS shall
implement the role of an IP-SM-GW as specified in subclause 5.3.3.1, subclause
5.3.3.2, subclause 5.3.3.3, and subclause 5.3.3.4.
To be compliant with short message over IP in MSISDN less operation in this
document, an AS shall implement the role of an IP-SM-GW as specified in
subclause 5.3.3.1, subclause 5.3.3.2, subclause 5.3.3.3, and subclause
5.3.3.5.
## 5.3 Roles
### 5.3.1 SM-over-IP sender
#### 5.3.1.1 General
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.1, the SM-over-IP
sender shall support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [10]
appropriate to the functional entity in which the SM-over-IP sender is
implemented. The SM-over-IP sender shall build and populate RP-DATA message,
containing all the information that a mobile station submitting an SM
according to 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] would place, for successful delivery. The SM-
over-IP sender shall parse and interpret RP- DATA, RP-ACK and RP-ERROR
messages, containing all the information that a mobile station receiving an SM
according to 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] would see, in a SM submission or status
report.
NOTE: If the SM-over-IP sender uses SMR entity timers as specified in 3GPP TS
24.011 [8], then TR1M is set to a value greater than timer F (see 3GPP TS
24.229 [10]).
#### 5.3.1.2 Submitting a short message
When an SM-over-IP sender wants to submit an SM over IP, the SM-over-IP sender
shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the following information:
a) the Request-URI, which shall contain the PSI of the SC of the SM-over-IP
sender;
NOTE 1: The PSI of the SC can be SIP URI or tel URI based on operator policy.
The PSI of the SC can be obtained using one of the following methods in the
priority order listed below:
1) provided by the user;
2) if UICC is used, then:
\- if an ISIM is present, then the PSI of the SC is obtained from the
EF~PSISMSC~ in DF_TELECOM as per 3GPP TS 31.103 [18];
\- if an ISIM is not present, then the PSI of the SC is obtained from the
EF~PSISMSC~ in DF_TELECOM as per 3GPP TS 31.102 [19]; or
\- if the PSI of the SC is not available in EF~PSISMSC~ in DF_TELECOM, then
the PSI of the SC contains the **_TSâ€‘Service-Centre-Address_** stored in the
EF~SMSP~ in DF_TELECOM as per 3GPP TS 31.102 [19]. If the PSI of the SC is
based on the E.164 number from the **_TSâ€‘Service-Centre-Address_** stored in
the EF~SMSP~ in DF_TELECOM then the URI constructed can be either a tel URI or
a SIP URI (using the \"user=phone\" SIP URI parameter format).
3) if SIM is used instead of UICC, then the PSI of the SC contains the
**_TSâ€‘Service Centre Address_** stored in the EF~SMSP~ in DF_TELECOM as per
3GPP TS 51.011 [20]. If the PSI of the SC is based on the E.164 number from
the **_TSâ€‘Service-Centre-Address_** stored in the EF~SMSP~ in DF_TELECOM then
the URI constructed can be either a tel URI or a SIP URI (using the
\"user=phone\" SIP URI parameter format); or
4) if neither the UICC nor SIM is used, then how the PSI of the SC is
configured and obtained is through means outside the scope of this
specification.
b) the From header, which shall contain a public user identity of the SM-over-
IP sender;
NOTE 2: The IP-SM-GW will have to use an address of the SM-over-IP sender that
the SC can process (i.e. an E.164 number). This address will come from a tel
URI in a P-Asserted-Identity header (as defined in RFC 3325 [13]) placed in
the SIP MESSAGE request by the P-CSCF or S-CSCF.
NOTE 3: The SM-over-IP sender has to store the Call-ID of the SIP MESSAGE
request, so it can associate the appropriate SIP MESSAGE request including a
submit report with it.
c) the To header, which shall contain the PSI of the SC of the SM-over-IP
sender;
d) the Content-Type header, which shall contain \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\";
and
e) the body of the request shall contain an RP-DATA message as defined in 3GPP
TS 24.011 [8], including the SMS headers and the SMS user information encoded
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3].
NOTE 4: The address of the SC is included in the RP-DATA message content. The
address of the SC included in the RP-DATA message content is stored in the
EF~SMSP~ in DF_TELECOM of the (U)SIM of the SM-over-IP sender.
NOTE 5: The SM-over-IP sender will use content transfer encoding of type
\"binary\" for the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
NOTE 6: Both the address of the SC and the PSI of the SC can be configured in
the EF~PSISMSC~ in DF_TELECOM of the USIM and ISIM respectively using the USAT
as per 3GPP TS 31.111 [21].
The SM-over-IP sender may request the SC to return the status of the submitted
message. The support of status report capabilities is optional for the SC.
When a SIP MESSAGE request including a submit report in the \"vnd.3gpp.sms\"
payload is received, the SM-over-IP sender shall:
\- if SM-over-IP sender supports In-Reply-To header usage and the In-Reply-To
header indicates that the request corresponds to a short message submitted by
the SM-over-IP sender, generate a 200 (OK) SIP response according to RFC 3428
[14].
if SM-over-IP sender supports In-Reply-To header usage and the In-Reply-To
header indicates that the request does not correspond to a short message
submitted by the SM-over-IP sender, a 488 (Not Acceptable here) SIP response
according to RFC 3428 [14].
\- if SM-over-IP sender does not support In-Reply-To header usage, generate a
200 (OK) SIP response according to RFC 3428 [14]; and extract the payload
encoded according to 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] for RP-ACK or RP-ERROR.
#### 5.3.1.3 Receiving a status report
When a SIP MESSAGE request including a status report in the \"vnd.3gpp.sms\"
payload is delivered, the SM-over-IP sender shall:
\- generate a SIP response according to RFC 3428 [14];
\- extract the payload encoded according to 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] for RP-DATA;
and
\- create a delivery report for the status report as described in subclause
5.3.2.4. The content of the delivery report is defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8].
#### 5.3.1.4 SM-over-IP sender procedures for operation without MSISDN
##### 5.3.1.4.1 General
This subclause specifies the procedures for the SM-over-IP sender to support
the MSISDN less.
An SM-over-IP sender supporting the procedures in this subclause shall
support:
a) procedures specified in subclause 5.3.1.1; and
b) the In-Reply-To header field.
##### 5.3.1.4.2 Submitting a short message and subscription without MSISDN
When an SM-over-IP sender wants to submit an SM over IP and the destination
side is addressed with a SIP URI, then the SM-over-IP sender shall perform the
actions as specified in subclause 5.3.1.2 with the following additions and
modifications:
a) the Content-Type header field, which shall contain \"multipart/mixed\";
b) an application/vnd.3gpp.sms+xml MIME body as described in subclause D.1
with a Content-Disposition header field set to \"render\" and with
\"handling\" header field parameter set to \"optional\". The XML document
shall contain a single \ element which contains the URI of the receiver of
the short message; and
c) an application/vnd.3gpp.sms MIME body containing the RP-DATA message as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8], including the SMS headers and the SMS user
information encoded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3] with a TP-DA field set
to the dummy MSISDN value as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [22].
The SM-over-IP sender can request the IP-SM-GW to return the status of
submitted messages.
When a SIP MESSAGE request including a submit report in the \"vnd.3gpp.sms\"
payload is received, the SM-over-IP sender shall:
1) if the In-Reply-To header field indicates that the request corresponds to a
short message submitted by the SM-over-IP sender, generate a 200 (OK) SIP
response according to RFC 3428 [14]; or

### 5.3.2 SM-over-IP receiver
#### 5.3.2.1 General
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.2, the SM-over-IP
receiver shall support the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [10]
appropriate to the functional entity in which the SM-over-IP receiver is
implemented. The SM-over-IP receiver shall build and populate RP-SMMA, RP-ACK,
and RP-ERROR messages, containing all the information that a mobile station
according to 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] would place, for a notification for
availability of memory and a delivery report. The SM-over-IP receiver shall
parse and interpret RP- DATA message, containing all the information that a

message delivery report; and
NOTE 2: The address of the receiver of the delivery report is taken from the
\ element of the xml document that has been received in the related SIP
MESSAGE request.
g) application/vnd.3gpp.sms MIME body containing the RP-ACK or RP-ERROR
message for the SM delivery report as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8].
NOTE 3: The SM-over-IP sender will use content transfer encoding of type
\"binary\" for the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
##### 5.3.2.6.4 Sending a notification about SM-over-IP receiver having memory
available
When an SM-over-IP receiver wants to send a notification about UE having
memory available, then the SM-over-IP receiver shall implement the procedures
of subclause 5.3.2.5.
### 5.3.3 IP-Short-Message-Gateway (IP-SM-GW)
#### 5.3.3.1 General
An IP-SM-GW for transport layer interworking provides the protocol
interworking for the submission of short messages from the SM-over-IP sender
to the SC, for the delivery of short messages from the SC to the SM-over-IP
receiver, and for the SMS-Status Reports from the SC to the SM-over-IP sender.
An IP-SM-GW in MSISDN less operation provides for SIP MESSAGE based submission
of short messages from the SM-over-IP sender to the SM-over-IP receiver, of
SMS Submit Reports to the SM-over-IP sender and SMS-Status Reports to the SM-
over-IP sender.
In addition to the procedures specified in subclause 5.3.3, the IP-SM-GW shall
support the procedures specified in subclause 5.7 in 3GPP TS 24.229 [10].
#### 5.3.3.2 Indication of SM-over-IP receiver availability status for
delivery of short messages
NOTE 1: If operator policy does not require the indication the availability
status of public user identity for receiving SMS over IP messages, then IP-SM-
GW will not receive third-party REGISTER request.
Upon receipt of a third-party REGISTER request, the IP-SM-GW shall:
\- send a 200 (OK) response for the REGISTER request;
\- if an MSISDN is received in the message body of the third party REGISTER
request within the \ XML element, store the MSISDN sent in the
message body of the REGISTER request within the \ XML element.
\- if no MSISDN is received,
a) if an Authorization header field was contained in the REGISTER request
received from the UE that is contained in a \"message/sip\" MIME body of the
third party REGISTER request, derive the IMSI from the private user identity
obtained from the \"username\" header field parameter of the Authorization
header field in the REGISTER request received from the UE that is contained in
a \"message/sip\" MIME body of the third party REGISTER request; or
b) if no Authorization header field was contained in the REGISTER request
received from the UE that is contained in a \"message/sip\" MIME body of the
third party REGISTER request derive the IMSI from the public user identity
obtained from the \"To\" header field in the REGISTER request received from
the UE that is contained in a \"message/sip\" MIME body of the third party
REGISTER request; and
NOTE 2: The actual format of the \ element is transparent to the
S-CSCF.
NOTE 3: The relation between private user identity and the IMSI is defined in
3GPP TS 23.003 [22].
NOTE 4: 3GPP TS 24.229 [10] specifies how the REGISTER request from the UE can
be included in the third party REGISTER request.
\- subscribe to the reg event package for the public user identity registered
at the user\'s registrar (S-CSCF) as described in RFC 3680 [15] and RFC 6665
[27].
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request the IP-SM-GW shall check the availability
status for receiving SMS over IP messages, i.e. if the public user identity
has a contact registered with the ability to receive SMS over IP messages. If
the availability status of the public user identity for receiving SMS over IP
messages has changed, the IP-SM-GW shall start a data update procedure to the
HSS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.002 [11] to indicate that either the MSISDN or
IMSI registered with it is available/unavailable for delivery of SMS.
#### 5.3.3.3 Answering routing information query
If a routing information query is received from the HSS/HLR, the IP-SM-GW
shall extract the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP receiver (destination UE) from the
received message. If the IP-SM-GW has information about a public user identity
associated with the MSISDN, the IP-SM-GW shall return its own address to the
SMS-GMSC that originated the routing information query.
If the IP-SM-GW has no information related to the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP
receiver (destination UE), the IP-SM-GW shall query the HSS/HLR for routing
information. If the query results in an error response, the IP-SM-GW shall
return the error response to the SMS-GMSC; otherwise the IP-SM-GW shall return
its own address to the SMS-GMSC that originated the routing information query.
NOTE: The address of the SMS-GMSC is available in the received routing
information query.
#### 5.3.3.4 Transport layer interworking
##### 5.3.3.4.1 Receiving a short message in a SIP MESSAGE request
NOTE 1: The SIP MESSAGE received from the SM-over-IP sender/receiver will
include a P-Asserted-Identity header (as defined in RFC 3325 [13]) containing
a tel URI of the SM-over-IP sender/receiver and will contain either a short
message (RP-DATA), or a notification for availability of memory (RP-SMMA), or
a delivery report (RP-ACK or RP-ERROR).
If a SIP MESSAGE request including \"vnd.3gpp.sms\" payload is received from
the SM-over-IP sender/receiver and the IP-SM-GW does not support the In-Reply-
To header usage, the IP-SM-GW shall:
1) respond with a 202 (Accepted) response;
2) extract and validate the format of the SC address from the received payload
as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [3];
3) extract the RPDU type (see 3GPP TS 24.011 [8]) from the received payload;
4) add the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP receiver to the RP International Mobile
Subscriber Identity field if the received payload is a notification for
availability of memory. If the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP receiver is not
available then insert the tel URI received in a P-Asserted-Identity header (as
defined in RFC 3325 [13]) placed in the SIP MESSAGE request by the P-CSCF or
S-CSCF; and
NOTE 2: The MSISDN is not available if the registration is not required
according to the operator policy.
5) include the RPDU type in the appropriate message to
\- the SC via SMS-IWMSC in case of a short message;
\- the SC via SMS-GMSC in case of a delivery report; or
\- the HSS in case of a notification for availability of memory.
If step 2) or 3) above fails for message that contains RPDU with RP-DATA or
RP-SMMA content, the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the
following information:
a) the Request-URI, containing the sending user's URI;
b) the Content-Type header, set to \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\"; and
c) the body of the request containing an RP-ERROR message including an
appropriate error code as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8].
NOTE 3: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
If a SIP MESSAGE request including \"vnd.3gpp.sms\" payload is received from
the sender/receiver, and the IP-SM-GW supports the In-Reply-To header, the IP-
SM-GW shall:
1) if the SIP MESSAGE does not include the In-Reply-To header:
a) respond with a 202 (Accepted) response;
b) extract and validate the format of the SC address from the received payload
as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [3];
c) extract the RPDU type (see 3GPP TS 24.011 [8]) from the received payload;
d) the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP receiver to the RP International Mobile
Subscriber Identity field if the received payload is a notification for
availability of memory. If the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP receiver is not
available then insert the tel URI received in a P-Asserted-Identity header (as
defined in RFC 3325 [13]) placed in the SIP MESSAGE request by the P-CSCF or
S-CSCF; and
NOTE 4: The MSISDN is not available if the registration is not required
according to the operator policy.
e) include the RPDU type in the appropriate message to
\- the SC via SMS-IWMSC in case of a short message;
\- the SC via SMS-GMSC in case of a delivery report; or
\- the HSS in case of a notification for availability of memory.
If step b) or c) above fails for message that contains RPDU with RP-DATA or
RP-SMMA content, the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the
following information:
\- the Request-URI, containing the sending user's URI;
\- the Content-Type header, set to \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\"; and
\- the body of the request containing an RP-ERROR message including an
appropriate error code as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8].
NOTE 5: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
2) if the SIP MESSAGE includes the In-Reply-To header:
a) if the In-Reply-To header indicates that the request does not correspond to
a short message submitted by the IP-SM-GW, send a 488 (Not Acceptable here)
SIP response according to RFC 3428 [14];
b) if the In-Reply-To header indicates that the request corresponds to a short
message submitted by the IP-SM-GW:
\- generate a 202 (Accepted) SIP response according to RFC 3428 [14];
\- extract and validate the format of the SC address from the received payload
as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [3];
\- extract the RPDU type (see 3GPP TS 24.011 [8]) from the received payload;
\- add the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP receiver to the RP International Mobile
Subscriber Identity field if the received payload is a notification for
availability of memory. If the MSISDN of the SM-over-IP receiver is not
available then insert the tel URI received in a P-Asserted-Identity header (as
defined in RFC 3325 [13]) placed in the SIP MESSAGE request by the P-CSCF or
S-CSCF; and
NOTE 6: The MSISDN is not available if the registration is not required
according to the operator policy.
> \- include the RPDU type in the appropriate message within the same MAP
> dialog delivering the short message to
\- the SC via SMS-GMSC in case of a delivery report; or
\- the HSS in case of a notification for availability of memory.
NOTE 7: The IP-SM-GW finding the MAP dialog using the SIP session identified
by the Call-ID contained in the In-Reply-To header.
if step 2) or 3) above fails for message that contains RPDU with RP-SMMA
content, the IP-SM-GW shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the following
information:
\- the Request-URI, containing the sending user's URI;
\- the Content-Type header, set to \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\"; and
\- the body of the request containing an RP-ERROR message including an
appropriate error code as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8].
NOTE 8: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
##### 5.3.3.4.2 Delivering a short message in a SIP MESSAGE request
If a short message is received from the SMS-GMSC, the IP-SM-GW shall extract
the IMSI of the SM-over-IP receiver from the received message. Then the IP-SM-
GW shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the following information:
a) the Request-URI, which shall contain a public user identity of the SM-over-
IP receiver associated with the received IMSI;
b) the Accept-Contact header, which shall contain a \"+g.3gpp.smsip\"
parameter and the \"explicit\" and \"require\" tags according to RFC 3841
[17];
c) the Request-Disposition header which shall contain the \"no-fork\"
directive;
d) the P-Asserted-Identity header which shall contain the SIP URI of the IP-
SM-GW;
e) the Content-Type header which shall contain \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\";
and
f) the body of the request which shall contain an RP-DATA message as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8], including the SMS headers and the SMS user information
encoded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3].
NOTE 1: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
If the IP-SM-GW cannot deliver the short message successfully in a SIP MESSAGE
request and cannot deliver the short message via SGSN or MSC, then the IP-SM-
GW will apply the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 29.311 [23] subclause
6.1.4.4.1 to send a delivery report to SC via SMS-GMSC.
NOTE 2: If routing information is available (SGSN or MSC address or both), the
IP-SM-GW can also attempt the delivery of a short message via SGSN or MSC or
both before sending a delivery report to SC via SMS-GMSC. The priority order
of these attempts (i.e., SMS over IP, SMS over CS, SMS over PS) is subject to
operator policy. However, if no MSISDN is present in the short message then no
routing information is obtainable by the IP-SM-GW, and attempting delivery of
the short message via other domains (e.g. MSC, SGSN) by the IP-SM-GW is not
possible.
##### 5.3.3.4.3 Forwarding a submit report in a SIP MESSAGE request
If an SM submit report is received from the SMS-IWMSC, the IP-SM-GW shall
retrieve the IMSI of the SM-over-IP sender from the existing MAP context. Then
the IP-SM-GW shall obtain a corresponding public user identity and send a SIP
MESSAGE request with the following information:
a) the Request-URI, which shall contain a public user identity of the SM-over-
IP sender;
b) the Request-Disposition header which shall contain the \"fork\" and
optionally the \"parallel\" directives;
c) the In-Reply-To header which shall contain the Call-Id of the SIP MESSAGE
request that included the submitted short message;
d) the P-Asserted-Identity header which shall contain the SIP URI of the IP-
SM-GW;
e) the Content-Type header which shall contain \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\";
and
f) the body of the request which shall contain an RP-ACK or RP-ERROR message
as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8].
NOTE: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
##### 5.3.3.4.4 Delivering a status report in a SIP MESSAGE request
If a status report is received from the SMS-GMSC, the IP-SM-GW shall extract
the IMSI of the SM-over-IP sender from the received message. Then the IP-SM-GW
shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the following information:
a) the Request-URI, which shall contain a public user identity of the SM-over-
IP sender associated with the received IMSI;
b) the Accept-Contact header, which shall contain a \"+g.3gpp.smsip\"
parameter and the \"explicit\" and \"require\" tags according to RFC 3841
[17];
c) the Request-Disposition header which shall contain the \"no-fork\"
directive;
NOTE 1: The status report is always sent to the SMS capable UE that registered
with the highest q value.
d) the Content-Type header which shall contain \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\";
and
e) the body of the request which shall contain an RP-DATA message as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8], including the SMS headers and the SMS user information
encoded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3].
NOTE 2: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
If the IP-SM-GW cannot deliver the status report successfully in a SIP MESSAGE
request and cannot deliver the short message via SGSN or MSC, then the IP-SM-
GW will apply the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 29.311 [23] subclause
6.1.4.4.1 to send a delivery report to SC via SMS-GMSC.
NOTE 3: If routing information is available (SGSN or MSC address or both), the
IP-SM-GW can also attempt the delivery of a short message via SGSN or MSC or
both before sending a delivery report to SC via SMS-GMSC. The priority order
of these attempts (i.e., SMS over IP, SMS over CS, SMS over PS) is subject to
operator policy.
NOTE 4: The SM-over-IP sender will acknowledge the status report with a
delivery report.
#### 5.3.3.5 IP-SM-GW procedures for operation without MSISDN

\"handling\" header field parameter set to \"optional\". The XML document
shall contain a single \ element which contains the URI of the sender of
the short message; and
10) include an application/vnd.3gpp.sms MIME body containing the RP-DATA
message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8], including the SMS headers and the
SMS user information encoded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3] as received in
the related SIP MESSAGE request.
NOTE 1: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
If a delivery report indicating no success contained in a SIP MESSAGE request
is received that has been sent by the terminating side IP-SM-GW, the IP-SM-GW
shall:
1) extract the received payload from the \"vnd.3gpp.sms\" payload; and
2) extract the received payload from the \"vnd.3gpp.sms+xml\" payload;
The IP-SM-GW will update the SC with the appropriate message as defined in
3GPP TS 29.002 [11]. The IP-SM-GW shall treat an unknown value in the
\ element as it treats the value \"SMDeliveryFailure\".
NOTE 2: The IP-SM-GW will send a MO_FORWARD_SM to the SC.
##### 5.3.3.5.5 Delivering a submit report in a SIP MESSAGE request
The IP-SM-GW may support sending of SM submit report. When the IP-SM-GW sends
a SM submit report, the IP-SM-GW shall support the procedures as specified in
subclause 5.3.3.4.3 starting with item a.
##### 5.3.3.5.6 Procedures for receiving a SIP MESSAGE request from an IP-SM-
GW
If a SIP MESSAGE request is received from another IP-SM-GW containing
a\"vnd.3gpp.sms\" MIME body; then the IP-SM-GW shall:
NOTE 1: It is configuration specific how the IP-SM-GW finds out that a SIP
MESSAGE request is received from another IP-SM-GW
1) send a SIP 202 (Accepted) response according to RFC 3428 [14];
2) save the SIP URI of the sending IP-SM-GW, contained in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field of the received SIP MESSAGE request; and
3) deliver the received content to the SM-over-IP-receiver as described in
subclause 5.3.3.5.3 or SM-over-IP-sender as described in subclause 5.3.3.5.4
If the IP-SM-GW cannot deliver the short message in a SIP MESSAGE request then
the IP-SM-GW shall send a delivery report encapsulated in a SIP MESSAGE
request to the originating side with the following information:
1) a Request-URI, which shall contain the identity as received in the
P-Asserted-Identity in the related SIP MESSAGE request from the originating
side;
2) a From header field which shall contain the SIP URI of the IP-SM-GW;
3) a P-Asserted-Identity header field which shall contain the SIP URI of the
IP-SM-GW;
4) a Feature-Caps header field with a \"+g.3gpp.smsip-msisdn-less\" header
field parameter;
5) a Content-Type header as specified in RFC 5621 [25], which shall contain
\"multipart/mixed\";
6) an application/vnd.3gpp.sms MIME body containing the RP-ERROR message as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 [8], including the SMS headers and the SMS user
information encoded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [3] as received in the
incoming SIP MESSAGE request; and
NOTE 2: The IP-SM-GW will use content transfer encoding of type \"binary\" for
the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE request.
7) an application/vnd.3gpp.sms+xml MIME body as described in subclause D.1
with a Content-Disposition header field set to \"render\" and with
\"handling\" header field parameter set to \"optional\". The XML document
shall contain a single \ element and a single \ element populated as defined in annex C.1.3.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Example signalling flows of SMS over IP
functionality
# B.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for the SMS over IP within the
IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem based on the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) and SIP Events.
These signalling flows provide detailed signalling flows, which expand on the
overview information flows provided in 3GPP TS 23.204 [5].
# B.2 Introduction
## B.2.1 General
The signalling flows provided in this annex follow the methodology developed
in 3GPP TS 24.228 [9]. The following additional considerations apply:
a) 3GPP TS 24.228 [9] shows separate signalling flows with no configuration
hiding between networks, and with configuration hiding between networks. There
is no SMS over IP specific functionality associated with this hiding, and
therefore such separate signalling flows are not show in the present document;
and
b) 3GPP TS 24.228 [9] does not show the functionality between the S-CSCF and
the AS. As the SMS over IP functionality depends on the functionality provided
by an AS, the signalling flows between S-CSCF and AS are shown in the present
document.
## B.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 [9]
subclauses 4.1 and 4.2 applies with the additions specified below.
\- ipsmgw.home1.net, ipsmgw.home2.net: IP-SM-GW in the home network of the SM-
over-IP sender/receiver;
\- sc.home1.net: PSI of the SC of the SM-over-IP sender
\- user1_public1\@home1.net: SM-over-IP sender; and
\- user2_public2\@home2.net: SM-over-IP receiver.
As in 3GPP TS 24.228 [9], in order to differentiate between SIP methods and
other protocol messages, the message name is preceded with the associated
protocol for all non-SIP messages.
Each signalling flow table contains descriptions for headers where the content
of the header is new to that signalling flow, as is already performed in 3GPP
TS 24.228 [9].
However, 3GPP TS 24.228 [9] includes extensive descriptions for the contents
of various headers following each of the tables representing the contents of
the signalling flows. Where the operation of the header is identical to that
shown in 3GPP TS 24.228 [9], then such text is not reproduced in the present
document.
Additional text may also be found on the contents of headers within 3GPP TS
24.228 [9] in addition to the material shown in the present document.
# B.3 Signalling flows demonstrating how IP-SM-GW indicates to HSS the
availability of public user identity for delivery of short messages
Figure B.3-1: IP-SM-GW registration signalling
Figure B.3-1 shows the registration signalling flow for the scenario when IP-
SM-GW registers to HSS. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **See 3GPP TS 24.228 [9], subclause 6.2 steps 1 through 22**
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 24.228 [9] contains Rel-5 registration; additional parameters
might appear in Rel-7 registration.
> **2\. Initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF analyses the incoming request against the initial filter criteria
and decides to send a third-party REGISTER request to the IP-SM-GW. Initial
Filter Criteria for IP-SM-GW includes a Service Information that contains the
MSISDN belonging to \"sip:user1_public1\@home1.net\".
> 3\. **REGISTER request (S-CSCF to IP-SM-GW) - see example in table B.3-1**
This signalling flow forwards the REGISTER request from the S-CSCF to the IP-
SM-GW.

The IP-SM-GW sends the request to inform the HSS/HLR that the user with MSISDN
\"11111111\" is ready to receive short messages for delivery via IP via the
sender of the request.
For detailed message flows and coding see 3GPP TS 29.002 [11].
Table B.3-7 provides the parameters in the AnyTimeModification request, which
are sent to the HSS/HLR.

# B.4 Signalling flows demonstrating how IP-SM-GW indicates to HSS the
unavailability of UE for delivery of short messages
Figure B.4-1: IP-SM-GW deregistration signalling
Figure B.4-1 shows the registration signalling flow for the scenario when IP-
SM-GW deregisters to HSS. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **See 3GPP TS 24.228 [9], subclause 6.2 steps 1 through 22**
Expires header set to zero. Public user identity deregisters its last SMS
capable contact.
NOTE 1: A flow for deregistration is not provided in 3GPP TS 24.228 [9].
However, deregistration is similar to a registration with the Expires header
set to zero. Compared to a Rel-5 deregistration additional parameters might
appear in a later release.
**2**. **NOTIFY request (S-CSCF to IP-SM-GW) - see example in table B.4-1**
The S-CSCF sends a first NOTIFY request to the IP-SM-GW. The notification
indicates that the monitored public user identity is not registered any more

# B.6 Signalling flows demonstrating successful UE terminated SM deliver
procedure over IP (including delivery report)
Figure B.6-1: UE originated SM deliver procedure over IP signalling
It is assumed that \"sip:user2_public2\@home2.net\" associated with
MSISDN=11111111 is registered at ipsmgw.home2.net using an SMS capable UE.
Figure B.6-1 shows a successful UE terminated SM over IP delivery. The details
of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **Receiving SM from SC**
The IP-SM-GW receives a short message from SC (sc.home1.net) which includes
SMS-DELIVER as type indicator and MSISDN=11111111 as destination UE.
2\. **MESSAGE request (IP-SM-GW to S-CSCF) - see example in table B.6-1**
This request includes a vnd.3gpp.sms payload that includes the short message
and routing information for the S-CSCF to forward the short message.

###### ## Annex C (normative): XML schemas
# C.1 Short-messsage-info XML schema
## C.1.1 General
This subclause defines XML schema and MIME type related to SMS over IP MSISDN
less operation.
## C.1.2 application/vnd.3gpp.sms+xml
The MIME type is used to carry information related to the MSISDN less
operation for SMS over IP. It is coded as an XML document and contains one or
more of the following information:
\- To
\- From
\- Correlation-ID
\- Delivery-Outcome
NOTE: The information elements cannot be present twice in the XML body.
## C.1.3 Data semantics
The \ element is the root element of the XML document and
contains one or more of the following elements:
1) a \ element which contains the identity of the receiver of the short
message, it is coded as a SIP URI;
2) a \ element which contains the identity of the sender of the short
message, it is coded as a SIP URI;
3) a \ element which contains the Correlation Identifier to be
used for interworking with the short message service center. The

## C.1.5 IANA registration
NOTE: RFC 4288 [26], subclause 9, states the process that applies in case of
changes to the registry of media types. Any changes to the format or to
subclause 5.1.3.5 after the registration with IANA would invoke this
procedure.
##### C.1.5.1 Name
##### C.1.5.2 Email
##### C.1.5.3 MIME media type name
Application
##### C.1.5.4 MIME subtype name
Vendor Tree -- vnd.3gpp.sms+xml
##### C.1.5.5 Required parameters
None
##### C.1.5.6 Optional parameters
None
##### C.1.5.7 Encoding considerations
Binary.
##### C.1.5.8 Security considerations
Same as general security considerations for application/xml as specified in
section 10 of IETF RFC 3023 [21]. In addition, this content type provides a
format for exchanging information in SIP, so the security considerations from
IETF RFC 3261 [19] apply.
The information transported in this MIME media type does not include active or
executable content.
Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters exist.
Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security mechanisms are
described in 3GPP TS24.229 [10].
##### C.1.5.9 Interoperability considerations
The MIME type allows interoperability of short message information between
mobile networks and other systems.
##### C.1.5.10 Published specification
3GPP TS 24.341
(http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/24341.htm)

##### C.1.5.14 Intended usage
Common.
Short Message Service is supported in mobile networks. The registration of the
associated MIME type allows MSISDN less operation of the Short Message
Service.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Feature-capability indicators defined within
the current document
# D.1 General
This subclause describes the feature-capability indicators definitions,
according to RFC 6809 [xxx], that are applicable for the realisation of SMS
over IP.
# D.2 Definition of feature-capability indicator g.3gpp.smsip-msisdn-less
Editor\'s note: [WID SMSMI-CT, CR#0052] this feature tag is to be registered
with IANA after the freezing of Rel-12.
Feature-capability indicator name: g.3gpp.smsip-msisdn-less.
Summary of the feature indicated by this feature-capability indicator:
This feature-capability indicator, when included in a Feature-Caps header
field as specified in RFC 6809 [24] in a SIP MESSAGE request, indicates the
support of the MSISDN-less operation for SMS over IP.
Feature-capability indicator specification reference: 3GPP TS 24.341:
\"Support of SMS over IP networks, stage 3\"
Values appropriate for use with this feature-capability indicator:
None.
The feature-capability indicator is intended primarily for use in the
following applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This
feature-capability indicator is used to indicate support of the MSISDN less
operation of SMS over IP and that the MESSAGE request has traversed an IP-SM-
GW.
Examples of typical use: Indicating capability to support MSISDN less
operation for a SIP MESSAGE request including a \"vnd.3gpp.sms\" payload.
Security Considerations: Security considerations for this feature-capability
indicator are discussed in clause 9 of RFC 6809 [24].
###### ## Annex E (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific
concepts when using EPS to access IM CN subsystem
# E.1 Scope
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for SMS services in the
IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem, where the IP-CAN is Evolved
Packet System (EPS).
# E.2 EPS aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
## E.2.1 Procedures at the UE
### E.2.1.1 Smart Congestion Mitigation
The following information is provided to the non-access stratum layer:
\- MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started; and
\- MO-SMSoIP-attempt-ended.
Upon request from the user to submit an originating SM over IP as described in
subclause 5.3.1 and no other originating SM over IP as described in subclause
5.3.1 exists, the UE sends the MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication to the
non-access stratum and continue with SM over IP submission as described in
subclause 5.3.1.
When an originating SM over IP submission is completed and no other
originating SM over IP as described in subclause 5.3.1 exists, the UE sends
the MO-SMSoIP-attempt-ended indication to the non-access stratum.
NOTE: If the UE supports other 3GPP specific mechanisms for communicating with
the non-access stratum protocol implementation, e.g. DHCP discovery via PCO,
then the UE is expected to support the transfer of information elements needed
for the smart congestion mitigation enforcement.
