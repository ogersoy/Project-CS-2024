# 1 Scope
The present document defines management objects that can be used by the Access
Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) and the UE.
The Management Object (MO) is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM)
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5].
The MO consists of relevant parameters for intersystem mobility policy- and
access network discovery information that can be managed by the ANDSF.
The service requirements and the functional requirements for the access
network discovery and selection are described in 3GPP TS 22.278 [2] and in
3GPP TS 23.402 [4] respectively.

# 4 ANDSF MO
## 4.1 Descriptions
### 4.1.1 General
The ANDSF MO is used to manage Inter-System Mobility Policy (ISMP), Inter-
System Routing Policy (ISRP), Inter-APN Routing Policy (IARP),
RuleSelectionInformation and WLAN Selection Policy (WLANSP) as well as access
network discovery information stored in a UE supporting provisioning of such
information from an ANDSF. In addition, the ANDSF MO is also used to manage
the HomeNetworkPreference policy stored in a UE supporting provisioning of
Preferred Service Provider List (PSPL) and S2a Connectivity Preference
information from an ANDSF.
The ANDSF may initiate the provision of information from the ANDSF to the UE
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [3AA].
If the UE wishes to provide the user location information to the ANDSF when
sending the Package 1 (see OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A]), the UE shall include
in the Package 1 a Generic Alert message (along with other commands) where the
\"Type\" element is set to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:ue_location\", the
\"Data\" element is set to the information contained in the UE_Location node
subtree (see subclause 5.6) encoded as XML formatted as specified by OMA-TS-
DM_TNDS-V1_2 [5B] and the \"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\" element)
is set to the address of the ANDSF Management Object as specified by OMA-TS-
DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A].
If the UE wishes to provide the UE profile information to the ANDSF while
sending Package 1 (see OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A]), the UE shall include in
Package 1 a Generic Alert message (along with other commands) where the
\"Type\" element is set to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:ue_profile\", the
\"Data\" element is set to the information contained in the UE_Profile node
subtree (see subclause 5.7A) encoded as XML formatted as specified by OMA-TS-
DM_TNDS-V1_2 [5B] and the \"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\" element)
is set to the address of the ANDSF Management Object as specified by OMA-TS-
DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A].
The UE may initiate the provision of all available information from the ANDSF,
using a client-initiated session Alert message of code \"Generic Alert\" (see
OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A]). When requesting all available information from
ANDSF, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set
to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:provision\", the \"LocURI\" element (inside
the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the address of the ANDSF Management
Object as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A] and the \"Data\" element
is not included.
When the UE is requesting partial ANDSF information, i.e. ISMP, Discovery
information or ISRP as defined in subclauses 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.5
respectively, the ANDSF server should provide the requested ANDSF information
to the UE. Additionally, the ANDSF server may provide other than the requested
ANDSF information during the same ANDSF session.
ISMP prioritizes access networks when the UE is not capable to connect to the
EPC through multiple accesses. ISRP indicates how to distribute traffic among
available accesses when the UE is capable to connect to the EPC through
multiple accesses (i.e. the UE is configured for IFOM, MAPCON, non-seamless
WLAN offload or any combination of these capabilities). IARP indicates which
traffic should be routed across different PDN connections and which traffic
should be non-seamlessly offloaded to WLAN. DiscoveryInformation provides
further information for the UE to access the access network defined in the
ISMP or in the ISRP. WLANSP provides information for the UE to select and
reselect a WLAN. RuleSelectionInformation indicates whether to prioritise
ISMP, ISRP and WLANSP provided by HPLMN or by VPLMN when the UE is roaming and
ANDSF rules are available from both HPLMN and VPLMN. The PSPL in
HomeNetworkPreference is used by the UE to determine the selected service
provider in order to construct NAI (see IETF RFC 4282 [25]) to perform 3GPP-
based access authentication over the selected WLAN as specified in 3GPP TS
23.402 [4]. HomeNetworkPreference policy also contains S2a Connectivity
Preference which is used to indicate whether or not the home operator prefers
the UE to establish PDN connections over WLAN by using the applicable S2a
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [4].
The MO defines validity areas, position of the UE and availability of access
networks in terms of geographical coordinates. The way such coordinates are
retrieved is implementation dependant (e.g. GPS receiver).
The UE is not required to switch on all UE\'s supported radios for deducing
its location for ANDSF purposes or for evaluating the validity area condition
of a policy or discovery information.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism as standardized (see
Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5]) may be used to grant or deny
access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and leaf objects of
the ANDSF MO.
The UE shall ignore any node which is a child of the ANDSF MO root node and is
not supported by the UE. The ANDSF server shall ignore any node which is a
child of the ANDSF MO root node and is not supported by the ANDSF server.
The UE shall support receiving OMA DM commands with bodies encoded as XML
formatted as described in OMA-TS-DM_TNDS-V1_2 [5B].
Validity criteria container of the ANDSF MO enables reducing redundancies in
ANDSF MO.
### 4.1.2 Policy (ISMP)
The Policy node represents ISMP and the information consists of a set of one
or more ISMP rules. At any point in time there shall be at most one rule
applied, that rule is referred to as the \'active\' rule. There may hence be
zero or one \'active\' rule.
The rules have a number of validity conditions (e.g. current access technology
and location) where one or more may be present and set to a value. The rules
also have a number of results (e.g. preferred access technology and restricted
access technology) to be used whenever a rule is \'active\'. If there are no
results for the \'active\' rule, it is implementation dependent how UE
performs network selection. When ANDSF policy selection rules identify an
available network, the highest priority rule becomes \'active\' rule and
network re-selection is performed. If the UE is roaming and ANDSF rules from
both Home ANDSF and Visited ANDSF are available, the active rule is selected
according to the \/RuleSelectionInformation as specified in
subclauses 4.1.9 and 5.10.
While the rule remains \'active\', UE shall keep considering higher priority
networks, than currently selected, in the prioritized network list of the
rule. In addition to conditions and results there is a rule-priority that
shall be set for each rule in order for the UE to determine which rule, out of
potentially several valid rules, it should consider as \'active\'.
The validity of the rule can be restricted by validity conditions. The
validity of the rule takes into account ValidityArea, ValidityAreaRef,
Roaming, TimeOfDay, and TimeOfDayRef, where each existing non-empty node must
match in order to make the rule valid. The UE does not make any evaluation on
nodes which are present and empty. In addition, this rule is considered valid
if none of the validity conditions exist.
The UE capable of any combinations of IFOM or MAPCON or non-seamless WLAN
offload with all those combination of capabilities disabled, or a UE which is
not IFOM capable and is not MAPCON capable and is not non‑seamless WLAN
offload capable, may initiate the provision of ISMP information from the
ANDSF, using a client initiated session containing a generic alert. When
requesting ISMP, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message
shall be set to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:provision-single-if\", the
\"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the address
of the ANDSF Management Object as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A]
and the \"Data\" element is not included.
The UE shall ignore any rule containing a node not supported by the UE.
### 4.1.3 Discovery information
The UE may initiate the provision of discovery information from the ANDSF
using a client initiated session containing a generic alert. When requesting
discovery information, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert
message shall be set to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:provision-disc-info\",
the \"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the
address of the ANDSF Management Object as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2
[5A] and the \"Data\" element is not included.
The UE shall ignore any node which is a descendant of the DiscoveryInformation
node and is not supported by the UE.
### 4.1.4 UE location
The MO has a node indicating the position of the UE. The trigger for updating
the value of this node is that the location information it contains is no
longer valid (i.e. the UE has changed its position) or some other manufacturer
specific trigger. The update of the information contained in this node doesn't
necessarily imply any interaction with the ANDSF server.
The ANDSF server shall ignore any node which is a descendant of the
UE_Location node and is not supported by the ANDSF server.
### 4.1.5 ISRP
The ISRP information consists of a set of one or more ISRP rules. Each ISRP
rule contains indication on traffic distribution for UEs that are configured
for IFOM, MAPCON or non-seamless WLAN offload.
Each ISRP rule has a PLMN leaf and an optional Roaming leaf. Roaming and PLMN
leaves are used by the UE to determine if an ISRP rule is valid, see subclause
5.7.60 and 5.7.61. At any point in time there shall be at most one ISRP rule
used for routing, and, that ISRP rule is referred to as the \'active\' ISRP
rule. There can be multiple valid ISRP rules at the same time. If UE is
roaming and ANDSF rules from both Home ANDSF and Visited ANDSF are available,
the active rule is selected according to the \/RuleSelectionInformation as specified in subclauses 4.1.9 and 5.10.
An ISRP rule can contain one or more flow distribution containers. These are
ForFlowBased for IFOM service, ForServiceBased for MAPCON and
ForNonSeamlessOffload for Non-seamless WLAN offload. A UE evaluates only the
supported flow distribution containers of the \'active\' ISRP rule. A flow
distribution container can have one or more flow distribution rules.
A flow distribution rule can have a validity condition defined by the
RoutingCriteria node. The validity of the flow distribution rule takes into
account ValidityArea, ValidityAreaRef, TimeOfDay, TimeOfDayRef,
RANValidityCondition and RANValidityConditionRef where each existing non-empty
node must match in order to make the rule valid. In addition, this flow
distribution rule without any validity conditions is considered valid, i.e.
validity condition is fulfilled. A flow distribution rule is applied only if
the validity condition is fulfilled and if the flow distribution rule is
contained by the \'active\' ISRP rule. A flow distribution rule has a number
of results (e.g. preferred access technology and restricted access technology)
defined in the RoutingRule node to be used whenever the flow distribution rule
is applied. Each flow distribution rule has also a mandatory node identifying
the data traffic (e.g. based on APN or IP flow description) to which the
results contained in RoutingRule node apply.
If there are no results for an \'active\' ISRP rule, it is implementation
dependent how UE performs network selection for the class of traffic to which
the results apply.
In addition to conditions, results and traffic class, there is a rule priority
that shall be set for each flow distribution rule. The rule priority is
encoded in RulePriority leaf, and it enables the UE to determine which flow
distribution rule, out of potentially several flow distribution rules,
contained in every supported flow distribution container of the \'active\'
ISRP rule, it should apply to an IP flow matching the data traffic description
of the multiple flow distribution rules. The ISRP rule consists of one or more
flow distribution container. Each flow distribution container is applicable
for either IFOM, MAPCON, or non-seamless WLAN offload. The scope of the
RulePriority extends across all supported flow distribution containers
belonging to the \'active\' ISRP rule. If the same flow matches multiple flow
distribution rules, then the flow distribution rule with the highest
RulePriority is applied for the IP flow.
If a flow matches multiple flow distribution rules with the same highest
priority, the selection of the flow distribution rule for routing of that flow
is implementation dependent. If there are multiple applied flow distribution
rules within the \'active\' ISRP rule and they refer to the same access
technology but different access networks and the UE is not able to have
connection to all of them at the same time, the selection of the access
network is implementation dependant.
The UE configured for IFOM or MAPCON or non-seamless WLAN offload or any
combination of these capabilities, may initiate the provision of ISRP
information from the ANDSF, using a client initiated session containing a
generic alert. When requesting ISRP, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM
generic alert message shall be set to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-
andsf:1.0:provision-multiple-if\", the \"LocURI\" element (inside the
\"Source\" element) shall be set to the address of the ANDSF Management Object
as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A] and the \"Data\" element is not
included.
If the UE indicated support for ISRP rules based on Application Identifers
(DIDA) in DevCapability, then when the ANDSF server provides an ISRP rule
containing an App-ID interior node, the ANDSF server sets the OSId leaf
contained in the App-ID interior node to the value of one of the OSId leaves
contained in the UE_Profile interior node.
The UE shall ignore any node which is a child of the ISRP rule (i.e. flow
distribution container) and is not supported by the UE.
The UE shall ignore any flow distribution rule containing a node not supported
by the UE.
### 4.1.6 UE_Profile
The UE_Profile node contains information pertaining to the UE that can be used
by the ANDSF server for information provisioning. This node is set by the UE
prior to establishing a connection with the ANDSF server.. The ANDSF server
retrieves information in this node after UE establishes connection with the
ANDSF server. The update of the information contained in this node doesn't
necessarily imply any interaction with the ANDSF server.
The ANDSF server shall ignore any node which is a descendant of the UE_Profile
node and is not supported by the ANDSF server.
### 4.1.7 WLANSP
The WLANSP information consists of a set of one or more WLANSP rules. At any
point in time, there shall be at most one rule applied, that rule is referred
to as the \'active\' rule. There can be multiple valid WLANSP rules at the
same time.
The validity of the rule can be restricted by validity conditions. The
validity of the rule takes into account ValidityArea, ValidityAreaRef,
Roaming, TimeOfDay and TimeOfDayRef, where each existing non-empty node must
match in order to make the rule valid. The UE does not make any evaluation on
nodes that are present and empty. In addition, this rule is considered valid
if none of the validity conditions exist.
A WLANSP rule can have one or more WLAN selection criteria defined under the
ANDSF _/WLANSP/\ /SelectionCriteria_ node. Each selection criterion
contains:
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/CriteriaPriority leaf;
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/HomeNetworkIndication leaf;
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/PreferredRoamingPartnerList leaf;
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/MinBackhaulThreshold leaf;
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/MaximumBSSLoadValue leaf;
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/RequiredProtoPortTuple leaf;
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/SPExclusionList leaf; and
\- ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/PreferredSSIDList node.
The UE does not make any evaluation on nodes and leaves that are present and
empty. A WLAN that matches all the present non-empty nodes and leaves of a
selection criterion of the active WLANSP rule is considered as matching the
selection criterion. The priority of a selection criterion is encoded in the
ANDSF/WLANSP/\/SelectionCriteria/\/CriteriaPriority leaf. The WLAN
priority defined in the PreferredSSIDList node represents the priority of the
WLAN matching the selection criterion.
In addition to validity conditions and selection criteria, there is a rule
priority that shall be set for each rule. The rule priority is encoded in
ANDSF/WLANSP/\/RulePriority leaf, and it enables the UE to determine which
rule, out of potentially several valid rules, it should consider as
\'active\'. If the UE is roaming and ANDSF rules from both Home ANDSF and
Visited ANDSF are available, the active rule is selected according to the
\/RuleSelectionInformation as specified in subclauses 4.1.9 and 5.10.
The UE may initiate the provision of WLANSP information from the ANDSF, using
a client-initiated session containing a generic alert. When requesting WLANSP,
the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set to
\"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:provision-wlansp-info\", the \"LocURI\"
element (inside the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the address of the
ANDSF Management Object as specified by OMA-TS-DM-Protocol-V1_2 [5A] and the
\"Data\" element is not included.
The UE shall ignore any rule containing a node not supported by the UE.
### 4.1.8 IARP
The IARP information consists of a set of one or more IARP rules. Each IARP
rule contains indication on traffic distribution for UEs that selects an APN
associated with an existing PDN connection or non-seamless WLAN offload for
routing the traffic matching specific IP flows.
Each IARP rule has a PLMN leaf and an optional Roaming leaf. Roaming and PLMN
leaves are used by the UE to determine if an IARP rule is valid, see subclause
5.9.60 and 5.9.61. At any point in time there shall be at most one IARP rule
applied, that IARP rule is referred to as the \'active\' IARP rule. There can
be multiple valid IARP rules at the same time, in which case the selection of
the active IARP rule implementation-dependent. When the UE is roaming, the
V-ANDSF shall not provide any IARP to a roaming UE. If the UE receives IARP
from a V-ANDSF then the UE shall ignore it.
An IARP rule can have two flow distribution containers. These are
ForInterAPNRouting for Inter-APN routing and ForNonSeamlessOffload for non-
seamless WLAN offload. A flow distribution container can have one or more flow
distribution rules.
A flow distribution rule can have a validity condition defined by the
RoutingCriteria node. The validity of the flow distribution rule takes into
account ValidityArea, ValidityAreaRef, TimeOfDay, TimeOfDayRef,
RANValidityCondition and RANValidityConditionRef where each existing non-empty
node must match in order to make the rule valid. In addition, this flow
distribution rule without any validity conditions is considered valid, i.e.
validity condition is fulfilled. A flow distribution rule is applied only if
the validity condition is fulfilled and if the flow distribution rule is
contained by the \'active\' IARP rule. A flow distribution rule has a number
of results (e.g. preferred APN and restricted APN) defined in the RoutingRule
node to be used whenever the flow distribution rule is applied. Each flow
distribution rule has also a mandatory node identifying the data traffic (e.g.
based on APN associated with the sent traffic or IP flow description of the
sent traffic) to which the results contained in RoutingRule node apply.
An IARP rule shall be first applied followed by an ISRP rule for the IP flow.
If there are no results for an \'active\' IARP rule, an ISRP rule shall be
applied for the IP flow. If there are no results for \'active\' IARP rule and
\'active\' ISRP rule, then it is implementation dependent how UE performs APN
selection or non-seamless WLAN offload for the class of traffic to which the
results apply.
In addition to conditions, results and IP flow description, there is a rule
priority that shall be set for each flow distribution rule. The rule priority
is encoded in RulePriority leaf, and it enables the UE to determine which flow
distribution rule, out of potentially several matching flow distribution
rules, of the \'active\' IARP rule, it should apply to an IP flow matching the
data traffic description of the multiple flow distribution rules. If the same
flow matches multiple flow distribution rules, then the flow distribution rule
with the highest RulePriority is applied for the IP flow. The scope of the
RulePriority extends across all supported flow distribution containers
belonging to the \'active\' IARP rule.
If a flow matches multiple flow distribution rules with the same highest
priority, the selection of the flow distribution rule for routing of that flow
is implementation dependent.
The UE may initiate the provision of IARP information from the ANDSF, using a
client initiated session containing a generic alert. When requesting IARP, the
\"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set to
\"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:provision-apnnswo-if\", the \"LocURI\" element
(inside the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the address of the ANDSF
Management Object as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A] and the
\"Data\" element is not included.
If the UE indicated support for IARP rules based on Application Identifers
(DIDA) in DevCapability, then when the ANDSF server provides an IARP rule
containing an App-ID interior node, the ANDSF server sets the OSId leaf
contained in the App-ID interior node to the value of one of the OSId leaves
contained in the UE_Profile interior node.
The UE shall ignore any node which is a child of the IARP rule (i.e. flow
distribution container) and is not supported by the UE.
The UE shall ignore any flow distribution rule containing a node not supported
by the UE.
### 4.1.9 Rule selection information
The rule selection information represents VPLMNs with preferred WLAN selection
rules defined in the RuleSelectionInformation node, which includes a
VPLMNswithPreferredRules node and a PLMN leaf, see subclause 5.10. The
VPLMNswithPreferredRules node contains one or more VPLMNs. Rule selection
information indicates whether to prioritise ISMP, ISRP and WLANSP provided by
VPLMN or by HPLMN when the UE is roaming and ANDSF rules are available from
both HPLMN and VPLMN.
### 4.1.10 Home Network Preference information
Home Network Preference information assists the UE in selecting a WLAN and a
service provider for 3GPP-based authentication over WLAN, as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.402 [4].
The UE shall only use the Home Network Preference information provided by the
H-ANDSF or, if H-ANDSF is not available, statically provisioned in the UE. The
UE shall ignore any Home Network Preference information provided by V-ANDSF .
The UE may initiate the provisioning of HomeNetworkPreference information from
the ANDSF, using a client-initiated session containing a generic alert. When
requesting HomeNetworkPreference, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic
alert message shall be set to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-andsf:1.0:provision-
homenetworkpreference-info\", the \"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\"
element) shall be set to the address of the ANDSF Management Object as
specified by OMA-TS-DM-Protocol-V1_2 [5A] and the \"Data\" element is not
included.
### 4.1.10A Visited Network Preference information
Visited Network Preference information assists the UE in selecting a WLAN and
a service provider for 3GPP-based authentication over WLAN when the UE is
roaming in a V-PLMN, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [4].
The Visited Network Preference information may be provided by a V-ANDSF only.
The UE shall ignore any VisitedNetworkPreference rules provided by an ANDSF
other than the V-ANDSF.
The UE may initiate the provisioning of VisitedNetworkPreference information
from the ANDSF, using a client-initiated session containing a generic alert.
When requesting VisitedNetworkPreference, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM
generic alert message shall be set to \"urn:oma:at:ext-3gpp-
andsf:1.0:provision-visitednetworkpreference-info\", the \"LocURI\" element
(inside the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the address of the ANDSF
Management Object as specified by OMA-TS-DM-Protocol-V1_2 [5A] and the
\"Data\" element is not included.

AnchorLongitude
The AnchorLongitude leaf indicates the longitude value of the centre of the
circular area.
\- Occurrence: One
\- Format: bin
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: \
The Longitude is defined in subclause 6.1 of 3GPP TS 23.032 [3A].
### 5.4.43 _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/ValidityArea/Geo_Location/Circular/_\ _/
Radius
The Radius leaf indicates the radius value of the circular area.
\- Occurrence: One
\- Format: int
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: \
The Radius is given in meters and is defined in subclause 6.6 of 3GPP TS
23.032 [3A].
### 5.4.43A _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/ValidityAreaRef
The ValidityAreaRef leaf contains a reference to a ValidityArea interior node.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: chr
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: \
The reference to a ValidityArea interior node is a full device URI as
specified in OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A], identifying the ValidityArea
interior node in the UE management tree.
ValidityAreaRef leaf is considered a match when the referenced ValidityArea
interior node is considered a match.
### 5.4.44 _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/Roaming
The Roaming leaf indicates the roaming condition for the ISMP rule.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: bool
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1
0 Indicates that the rule is only valid when the UE is not roaming.
1 Indicates that the rule is only valid when the UE is roaming.
The UE shall consider a rule with the Roaming leaf present as valid only if
the current roaming state (roaming/not roaming) of the UE matches the one
indicated in the Roaming value.
NOTE: When the UE is roaming, how it discovers and interacts with the ANDSF is
not specified in the specification of this release.
### 5.4.45 _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/PLMN
The PLMN leaf indicates a PLMN code of the operator, which created this
policy.

### 5.4.46 _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/TimeOfDay
The TimeOfDay node indicates the time of day condition for the ISMP rule.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
The validity condition of TimeOf Day is considered fulfilled when the time of
day in the current time zone, as indicated by the UE, matches at least one
time interval indicated in the TimeOfDay node.
If the ANDSF/Policy/\/TimeOfDay/\ node is present and empty (i.e. none
of the nodes TimeStart, TimeStop, DateStart, DateStop or DayOfWeek exist),
then the TimeOfDay is not considered when evaluating the validity of the
corresponding rule.
If the UE does not support calendar or clock application, only rules without
TimeOfDay node or rules with empty TimeOfDay node can be considered as valid
rules.
### 5.4.47 _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/TimeOfDay/_\ _
This interior node acts as a placeholder for one or more time of day condition
for the ISMP rule.
\- Occurrence: OneOrMore
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
The UE shall interpret the TimeOfDay leaf values as related to the local time
of the UE. The TimeOfDay conditions are evaluated as specified in table
5.4.47.1 and table 5.4.47.2.
Table 5.4.47.1 also specifies TimeOfDay leaf combinations, which are not
allowed. ANDSF shall not use such leaf combinations and UE processing of such
combinations is UE implementation specific.
NOTE 1: TimeOfDay leaf value combinations, where TimeStart, TimeStop, or both
TimeStart and TimeStop are not included, are explained in table 5.4.47.1.
NOTE 2: TimeOfDay leaf value combinations, where both TimeStart and TimeStop
are included are explained in table 5.4.47.2. The second half of table
5.4.47.2, where TimeStop is before TimeStart, explains how to configure
overnight time periods.
Figure 5.4.47.1 shows an example of overnight TimeOfDay repetitious periods
when both DateStart and DateStop leaves are included.

does not exist is UE implementation specific.
### 5.4.51A _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/TimeOfDay/_\ /DayOfWeek_
The DayOfWeek leaf indicates the day(s) of the week for which the
corresponding rule is valid.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: int
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: \
The value of this leaf is an 8-bit integer formated as a bit map representing
days of the week. The most significant bit is set to one. The remaining bits
represent days of the week, as shown in figure 5.4.51A.1:
Figure 5.4.51A.1: Bitmap format for the value of DayOfWeek leaf
If the bit corresponding to a day of the week is set, the rule is valid on
that day. The following values are invalid:
\- \"null\";
\- 128; and
\- less than 128.
The UE processing of invalid values is implementation dependent.
### 5.4.51B _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/TimeOfDayRef
The TimeOfDayRef leaf contains a reference to a TimeOfDay interior node.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: chr
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: \
The reference to a TimeOfDay interior node is a full device URI as specified
in OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5A], identifying the TimeOfDay interior node in
the UE management tree.
TimeOfDayRef leaf is considered a match when the referenced TimeOfDay interior
node is considered a match.
### 5.4.52 _ANDSF_ /Policy/_\ _/UpdatePolicy
The UpdatePolicy leaf indicates the update policy for the ISMP.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: bool
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1
0 Indicates that the UE is not required to request an update of the ISMP.
1 Indicates that the UE is required to request an update of the ISMP.
The UpdatePolicy value may be used by the UE to determine whether or not to
request an update of its ISMP when the rule is no longer considered to be
valid by the UE.
The default value 0 applies if this leaf is not provisioned.
## 5.5 Discovery information
### 5.5.1 _ANDSF_ /DiscoveryInformation
The DiscoveryInformation node acts as a placeholder for access network
discovery information.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get, Replace

# 6 MO for WiMAX
## 6.1 Introduction
This section defines the WiMAX Network Discovery and Selection (WNDS) MO and
the corresponding behaviour of the UE with regard to discovering and selecting
WiMAX access networks in the home operator network. The service requirements
for the WiMAX network discovery and selection function are described in 3GPP
TS 23.402 [4].
The WNDS MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5].
## 6.2 WNDS MO
The WNDS MO is used to manage WiMAX network discovery and selection
information stored in the UE and supports provisioning of such information
from the ANDSF.
The ANDSF may initiate the provisioning of WiMAX specific information using a
server initiated session alert message. The UE may initiate the provision of
information from the ANDSF using a client initiated session alert message.
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-wnds:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism as standardized (see
Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [5]) may be used to grant or deny
access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes and leaf objects of
the WNDS MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the WiMAX Network
Discovery and Selection node as described in figure 6.2.1:

###### ## Annex C (informative): ANDSF Configuration Examples
# C.1 Introduction
This annex provides examples illustrating how ANDSF MO is configured to convey
policies for routing traffic to 3GPP and WLAN access. The examples are for
illustration purposes only. They should not be construed to reflect
recommendations or instructions about how to configure ANDSF MO and/or the UE
in practical scenarios.
# C.2 ISRP example
## C.2.1 UE and network configuration
The operator\'s policy aims at steering the traffic generated by the following
applications on the UE:
\- SKP is a VoIP mobile app pre-configured to \"internet\" APN;
\- YTB is a video streaming mobile app pre-configured to \"internet\" APN.
User can also access the service via browser at YTB.com (IPv4 address
A.B.C.D);
\- FBK is a social media mobile app pre-configured to \"internet\" APN. User
can also access the service via browser at FBK.com (IPv4 address W.X.Y.Z);
\- VoLTE is an IMS voice mobile app pre-configured to \"IMS\" APN; and
\- all other traffic goes via \"internet\" APN.
100100 is the PLMN ID of the HPLMN. HPLMN has EPC-routed WiFi with
SSID=\"WiFi_EPC_A\".
100101 is the PLMN ID of the roaming VPLMN. VPLMN has EPC-routed WiFi with
SSID=\"WiFi_EPC_B\"and non-seamless wireless offload with
SSID=\"WiFi_NSWO_B\".
## C.2.2 Operator\'s policies
HPLMN configures the policy as follows:
**Within HPLMN:**
\- MAPCON rule A1 to route IMS APN to cellular only (WiFi restricted), rule
priority = 30;
\- MAPCON rule A2 to route internet APN to cellular with higher priority and
to EPC-routed WiFi with lower priority, rule priority = 30;
\- ISRP rule IFOM_1 to route SKP and YTB traffic to EPC-routed WiFi only
(cellular restricted) and any other WiFi with lower priority during peak hours
(7AM to 7PM), rule priority = 1;
\- ISRP rule IFOM_2 to route SKP and YTB traffic to EPC-routed WiFi with
higher priority and to cellular with lower priority during all hours, rule
priority = 10;
\- ISRP rule IFOM_3 to route FBK traffic to EPC-routed WiFi with higher
priority and to cellular with lower priority during peak hours within TAC A
and TAC B, rule priority = 1;
\- ISRP rule IFOM_4 to route FBK traffic to cellular with higher priority and
to EPC-routed WiFi with lower priority in all hours and locations, rule
priority = 10; and
\- ISRP rule IFOM_5 to route all traffic to EPC-routed WiFi with higher
priority and to cellular with lower priority in all hours and locations, rule
priority = 20.
**When roaming:**
\- MAPCON rule B1 to route IMS APN to cellular only (WiFi restricted), rule
priority = 30; and
\- MAPCON rule B2 to route internet APN to EPC-routed WiFi with higher
priority and to cellular with lower priority, rule priority = 30.
VPLMN configures the policy as follows:
\- MAPCON rule B1 to route IMS APN to cellular only (WiFi restricted), rule
priority = 30;
\- MAPCON rule B2 to route internet APN to EPC-routed WiFi with higher
priority and to cellular with lower priority, rule priority = 30; and
\- ISRP rule NSWO_1 to route internet APN to NSWO; rule priority = 20.
## C.2.3 ANDSF MO configuration
Figure C.2.3.1 shows the ISRP in the ANDSF MO configured by the H-ANDSF. The
ForFlowBased ISRP flow distribution rules are shown in figure C.2.3.2.
Figure C.2.3.1: ISRP configured by H-ANDSF
Figure C.2.3.2: ForFlowBased ISRP configured by H-ANDSF
Figure C.2.3.3 below shows the ISRP in the ANDSF MO configured by the V-ANDSF:
Figure C.2.3.3: ISRP configured by V-ANDSF
## C.2.4 Usage scenarios
**Scenario 1**
UE is in HPLMN. The only valid ISRP rule is ISRP/Home, which is therefore the
active rule. The UE routes the traffic according to the policy configured by
HPLMN for usage within HPLMN as configured in the ISRP/Home ISRP rule.
**Scenario 2**
UE is in a V-PLMN. The V-PLMN does not have an ANDSF server or the UE cannot
establish connectivity with the V-ANDSF. The ISRP/Home rule is not valid. The
only valid ISRP rule is ISRP/Roaming, which is therefore the active rule. The
UE routes the traffic according to the policy configured by HPLMN for usage
when roaming as configured in the ISRP/Roaming rule.
**Scenario 3**
UE is in a V-PLMN. The UE successfully establishes connectivity with the
V-ANDSF and gets the policy. The ISRP/Home rule is not valid. The valid ISRP
rules are ISRP/Roaming and ISRP/Visiting. Since the rules provided by the
V-ANDSF take precedence in roaming situations, the active rule is
ISRP/Visiting. The UE routes the traffic according to the policy configured by
V-PLMN for roaming users as configured in the ISRP/Visiting ISRP rule.
# C.3 IARP example
## C.3.1 UE and network configuration
The UE has the following applications installed:
\- SKP is a VoIP mobile app;
\- FBK is a social media mobile app. User can also access the service via
browser at FBK.com (IPv4 address W.X.Y.Z);
\- VoLTE is an IMS voice mobile app; and
\- NFX is a real time streaming media mobile app.
The above mobile apps are not pre-configured to use any APN. The home operator
wants to use IARP to assign APNs to application flows.
100100 is the PLMN ID of the HPLMN. HPLMN has non-seamless WLAN offload with
SSID=\"WiFi_NSWO_A\".
## C.3.2 Operator\'s policies
HPLMN operator configures IARP for non-roaming scenario as follows:
\- Route SKP and FBK traffic through NSWO between 7AM and 7PM on weekdays;
\- Route SKP and FBK traffic via \"internet\" APN between 7PM and 7AM on
weekdays, all day on weekends and anytime when NSWO is not available;
\- Route VoLTE traffic via \"IMS\" APN; and
\- Route NFX to \"media\" APN.
HPLMN operator configures the same IARP for roaming scenario with the
following exception:
\- Route NFX to \"internet\" APN, since roaming networks may not have
\"media\" APN.
## C.3.3 ANDSF MO configuration
Figure C.3.3.1 shows the IARP policy in the ANDSF MO configured by the
H-ANDSF. IARP flow distribution rules for HPLMN are shown in figure C.3.3.2.
Figure C.3.3.1: IARP configured by H-ANDSF
Figure C.3.3.2: IARP flow distribution rules for HPLMN
IARP InterAPNRouting flow distribution rules for roaming scenario are shown in
figure C.3.3.3.
Figure C.3.3.3: IARP InterAPNRouting flow distribution rules for roaming
## C.3.4 Usage scenarios
**Scenario 1**
UE is in the HPLMN. The only valid IARP rule is IARP/Home, which is therefore
the active rule. The UE assigns the traffic to APNs according to the IARP
configured by the H-ANDSF for usage within HPLMN as configured in the
IARP/Home rule.
**Scenario 2**
UE is in the V-PLMN. The IARP/Home rule is not valid. The UE successfully
establishes connectivity with the V-ANDSF and gets the policy update but the
V-ANDSF cannot provide IARP to a roaming UE. Therefore, the only valid IARP
rule is IARP/Roaming, which is therefore the active rule. The UE assigns the
traffic to APNs according to the IARP configured by HPLMN for usage when
roaming as configured in the ISRP/Roaming IARP rule.
