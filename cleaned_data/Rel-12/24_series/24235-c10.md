# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
This document defines the 3GPP System to Wireless Local Area Network
interworking Management Object (MO) for I-WLAN PLMN selection as specified in
3GPP TS 24.234 [3]. The management object is compatible with OMA Device
Management protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined
using the OMA DM Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler
Release Definition OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [2].
The 3GPP System to Wireless Local Area Network interworking Management Object
consists of relevant parameters that can be managed for WLAN UE as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.234 [3].
The Access Network Discovery and Selection Function MO as specified in 3GPP TS
24.312 [13] supercedes the Wireless Local Area Network interworking MO for
I-WLAN PLMN selection from Rel-12 onwards.
No further changes to this specification are intended. If any future evolution
of the procedures in this specification is necessary, it should be documented
in other specifications.

# 4 I-WLAN Management Object
The 3GPP System to Wireless Local Area Network interworking Management Object
(MO) is used to configure WLAN UE behavior for 3GPP System to Wireless Local
Area Network as specified in 3GPP TS 24.234 [3].
The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-IWLAN:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA DM 1.2.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[2]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the I-WLAN MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the I-WLAN node as
described in figure 4-1:
