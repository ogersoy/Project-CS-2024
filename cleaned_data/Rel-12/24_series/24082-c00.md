# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3GPP.
This TS specifies the procedures used at the radio interface for: normal
operation, registration, erasure, activation, deactivation, interrogation, and
network invocation of the call offering supplementary services within the 3GPP
system.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of this TS, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying
change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Version 3.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 Indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been

# 0 Scope
This European Standard (EN) specifies the procedures used at the radio
interface (reference point Um as defined in 3GPP TS 24.002) for normal
operation, registration, erasure, activation, deactivation, interrogation and
network invocation of call offering supplementary services. Provision and
withdrawal of supplementary services is an administrative matter between the
mobile subscriber and the service provider and cause no signalling on the
radio interface.
In 3GPP TS 24.010, the general aspects of the specification of supplementary
services at the layer 3 radio interface are given.
3GPP TS 24.080 specifies the formats and coding for the supplementary
services.
Definitions and descriptions of supplementary services are given in 3GPP TS
22.004 and 3GPP TS 22.08x and 3GPP TS 22.09x‑series. 3GPP TS 22.082 is related
specially to call offering supplementary services.
Technical realization of supplementary services is described in 3GPP TS 23.011
and 3GPP TS 23.08x and 3GPP TS 23.09x‑series. 3GPP TS 23.082 is related
specially to call offering supplementary services.
The procedures for Call Control, Mobility Management and Radio Resource
management at the layer 3 radio interface are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 and
3GPP TS 24.008.
The following supplementary services belong to the call offering supplementary
services and are described in the present document:
\- Call forwarding unconditional (CFU) (clause 1);
\- Call forwarding on mobile subscriber busy (CFB) (clause 2);
\- Call forwarding on no reply (CFNRy) (clause 3);
\- Call forwarding on mobile subscriber not reachable (CFNRc) (clause 4).

## 0.2 Abbreviations
Abbreviations used in the present document are listed in 3GPP TR 21.905.
## 0.3 Cross phase compatibility
For the following supplementary services, a number of changes exist between
the present document and the protocol version 1 specification:
\- Call forwarding unconditional;
\- Call forwarding on mobile subscriber busy;
\- Call forwarding on no reply;
\- Call forwarding on mobile subscriber not reachable.
For these supplementary services, the main body of the present document
assumes that all network entities comply with this version of the service. In
each case, an additional subclause (subclause x.7) defines the additional
requirements for when one or more network entities or the MS complies with the
protocol version 1 specifications for the supplementary service procedures.
# 1 Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)
## 1.1 Normal operation
### 1.1.1 Served mobile subscriber side
When call forwarding unconditional is active, all incoming calls for the
specified basic service(s) will be forwarded without being offered to the
served mobile subscriber.
When CFU is active, the ability of the served mobile subscriber to originate
calls is not affected. However, a NotifySS operation containing the SS-Status
indicating that CFU is currently active and operative will be sent to the
served mobile subscriber each time an outgoing call is made, see figure 1.1.

in this case,\ if CFB is active for the requested basic service
When an incoming call is forwarded on mobile subscriber busy due to NDUB the
served mobile subscriber can, as a subscription option, receive a NotifySS
operation containing the SS-Notification indicating that a call has been
forwarded, see figure 2.1. He will not be able to answer the incoming call.
The transaction identifier employed shall correspond to any call B is having.
