The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical

# 1 Scope
The present document defines Management Objects (MO) that are used to
configure the ProSe-enabled UE.
The MOs are compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and are defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [3].
The MOs consist of relevant parameters for provisioning and authorisation of
ProSe at the ProSe-enabled UE.
The protocol aspects for ProSe are described in 3GPP TS 24.334 [4].
In this release of the specification, ProSe direct discovery is supported only
when the UE is served by E-UTRAN.

# 4 ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO
## 4.1 Overview
The ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO is used to manage ProSe direct
discovery authorisation and provisioning information for a ProSe-enabled non-
public safety UE.
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-prose-direct-provisioning:1.0.
The UE may initiate the provision of all available information from the DPF,
using a client-initiated session Alert message of code \"Generic Alert\" (see
OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5]). When requesting all available information from
the DPF, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set
to \"urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-prose-direct-provisioning:1.0:provision\", the
\"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the address
of the DPF as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5] and the \"Data\"
element is not included.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[3]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible in the ProSe Direct Services
Provisioning MO as described in figure 4.1.1:

# 6 EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning MO
## 6.1 Overview
The EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning MO is used to manage configuration
parameters related to the EPC-level ProSe discovery.
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-EPC-level-prose-discovery-
provisioning:1.0.
The UE may initiate the provision of all available information from the DPF,
using a client-initiated session Alert message of code \"Generic Alert\" (see
OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5]). When requesting all available information from
the DPF, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set
to \"urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-EPC-level-prose-discovery-
provisioning:1.0:provision\", the \"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\"
element) shall be set to the address of the DPF as specified by OMA-TS-
DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5] and the \"Data\" element is not included.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[3]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning
MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible in the EPC-level ProSe
discovery Provisioning MO as described in figure 6.1.1:
