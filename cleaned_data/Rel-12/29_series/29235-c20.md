# 4 Interworking between a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network and an
external SIP-I based network
## 4.1 Reference Model
Figure 4.1.1 shows the interworking reference model for the interworking
between a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network and an external SIP-I
based network:
Figure 4.1.1: interworking reference model
The IWU provides the control plane interworking between the external network
and the SIP-I based circuit-switched core network. The IWU is a logical
function within the GMSC Server (for incoming calls) and the MSC Server (for
outgoing calls) that may reside with other 3GPP logical functions.
The user plane interworking is provided by the UP-IWU. The UP-IWU is a logical
function within the MGW.
NOTE: In call scenarios without the need for the (G)MSC server to manipulate
the bearer, the (G)MSC server may perform call control signalling without any
associated MGW by not inserting a MGW in the bearer path during the call
establishment. Call scenarios where the (G)MSC server needs to manipulate the
bearer, e.g. scenarios with insertion of tones or announcements, lawful
interception, CAMEL services do not allow this optimisation.
**Nb reference point:** The Nb reference point is defined in accordance with
TS 29.414 [43].
**Nc reference point** : The Nc reference point is defined in accordance with
TS 29.231 [4].
## 4.2 Signalling Interworking of a Call from the external SIP-I based network
towards the SIP-I based circuit-switched core network
### 4.2.1 Interworking of SIP-I messages received from external SIP-I network
#### 4.2.1.1 General
The IWU shall decapsulate the ISUP message from the received SIP message
according to the rules for Profile C in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
The resulting ISUP message shall be encapsulated into the SIP message. The
selected SIP Header fields relating to the handling of the ISUP body shall be
set as specified in clause 5.4.1.2 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6]. The
IWU sends the constructed SIP message to the succeeding 3GPP node.
#### 4.2.1.2 Call Release from external SIP-I network when encapsulated REL is
missing
If the IWU receives a SIP BYE request without an encapsulated ISUP message
then the IWU may construct an ISUP REL message according to the rules
specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] and encapsulate it into a SIP
message, which is sent to the succeeding 3GPP node.
NOTE: A SIP BYE request without an encapsulated ISUP message can be received
from a CS-IBCF or from a node of an interconnect network when they initiate
autonomous call release. It is expected that a generated ISUP REL won\'t add
any additional information which is not available in the received SIP BYE
request.
The IWU shall send a 200 OK final response to the BYE request without an
encapsulated RLC message towards the external SIP-I network.
### 4.2.2 Special Procedures for the reception of initial SIP INVITE requests
#### 4.2.2.1 Receipt of SIP INVITE request
If the initial SIP-I INVITE request does not provide a complete number, then
the IWU shall collect all digits required to identify the called subscriber in
subsequent SIP INVITE requests as specified for Profile C in ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6]. The IWU shall not propagate overlap signalling as
described for Profile C in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
The IWU shall trigger GMSC functions after having constructed the ISUP
message, as described in 4.2.1 above. The GMSC interrogates the HLR to get a
roaming number (MSRN). The Called Party Number in the ISUP IAM message is
changed by the GMSC function to the MSRN. The IWU shall include the MSRN into
the Request-URI as the new target.
#### 4.2.2.2 Receipt of SIP INVITE requests with SDP
Based on configuration the IWU may choose to transcode media. But the IWU
shall always provide the TMR/USI/HLC parameters as received on the incoming
side.
#### 4.2.2.3 Receipt of SIP INVITE request without SDP
An IWU may reject receipt of SIP INVITE requests without SDP offer. Otherwise
the rules of clause 4.2.2.1 apply with the following deviations:
The IWU shall construct an SDP offer with contents according to local policy,
e.g. SDP for a G.711speech call. The IWU may use the TMR and USI parameters of
the encapsulated IAM to determine the desired service and construct the SDP
offer accordingly. The IWU may then send to the succeeding 3GPP node the SIP
INVITE request with the constructed SDP offer and encapsulated IAM.
If reliable provisional responses (see IETF RFC 3262 [21]) are supported in
the external SIP-I network, the IWU may immediately send the SDP offer within
a 183 Session Progress message to the preceding node. When the IWU receives
the SDP answer then the IWU should send to the succeeding 3GPP node the SIP
INVITE request with an encapsulated IAM message. Otherwise, the IWU shall
behave in accordance with the paragraph above.
#### 4.2.2.4 MGW Selection
The IWU may apply the optional \"optimised MGW selection\", \"deferred MGW
selection\" or \"MGW bypass\" procedures towards the succeeding SIP-I based
circuit switched core network as described in clause 4.4 of TS 23.231 [3].
If MGW bypass is implemented and the IWU receives a MGW identifier:
\- in a SDP offer from external SIP-I network the IWU shall remove the MGW
identifier from the SDP offer before propagating the SDP offer to the
succeeding 3GPP node;
\- in a SDP answer from the succeeding 3GPP node the IWU shall remove the MGW
identifier from the SDP answer before propagating back the SDP answer to the
external network.
NOTE: If MGW bypass is implemented and the external network does not include a
specified connection address (0.0.0.0 for IPv4) then this will be interpreted
as supporting deferred MGW selection by the succeeding node. The succeeding
node will select a MGW accordingly and may return the MGW Identifier to the
IWU).
Otherwise the IWU shall seize a MGW and shall include the MGW connection
address into the SDP offer of the initial SIP INVITE request it will send to
the succeeding 3GPP node.
### 4.2.3 Interworking of SIP-I messages received from succeeding 3GPP node
Whenever the IWU receives from the succeeding 3GPP node a SIP message with an
encapsulated CON, ACM, CPG, ANM, SUS, RES message then the IWU sends the SIP
message in accordance with rules in accordance with ITU-T Recommendation
Q.1912.5 [6] to the external SIP-I network and the encapsulated ISUP message
shall not be modified.
### 4.2.4 Special Procedures for Profile Interworking
#### 4.2.4.1 Support of 100Rel
The IWU receiving a SIP INVITE with or without tag \"100Rel\" in the SUPPORTED
or the REQUIRED header from the external SIP-I network shall advertise its
preference of provisional reliable responses to the succeeding 3GPP node via a
SUPPORTED header in the initial SIP INVITE request.
As an option the IWU may consider a received SIP INVITE request without
\"100Rel\" as erroneous and reject the INVITE request with a 421 \"Extension
Required\" response.
NOTE: The option to forward a SIP INVITE request to the succeeding 3GPP node
with or without tag \"100Rel\", if the external network does not support
reliable provisional responses, is not specified in the present specification.
#### 4.2.4.2 Support for UPDATE method
The IWU receiving a SIP INVITE with or without the UPDATE method included in
the ALLOW header shall advertise its support for the UPDATE method to the
succeeding 3GPP node by listing the UPDATE method in the ALLOW header field.
As an option the IWU may consider a received initial SIP INVITE request
without listing UPDATE in the ALLOW header field as erroneous and reject the
INVITE request with a 403 \"Forbidden\" response.
NOTE: The option to forward a SIP INVITE request to the succeeding 3GPP node
without indicating support of the UPDATE method, if the external network does
not support the UPDATE method, is not specified in the present specification.
#### 4.2.4.3 Support for Preconditions
When the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that remote preconditions are
met and local preconditions are met then the IWU may either not include the
tag \"precondition\" and exclude appropriate SDP lines, or include the tag
\"preconditions\" in the SUPPORTED header and provide an SDP offer indicating
that preconditions are met.
When the incoming SIP INVITE request does not contain a \"precondition\" tag
the IWU shall assume the preconditions have been met within the external SIP-I
network. If local preconditions are met then the IWU may either not include
the tag \"precondition\" and exclude appropriate SDP lines, or include the tag
\"precondition\" in the SUPPORTED header and provide an SDP offer indicating
that preconditions are met.
When the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that remote preconditions are
not met or when local preconditions are not met then the IWU shall include the
tag \"precondition\" in the REQUIRE header or SUPPORTED header in the SIP
INVITE request and shall encode preconditions in the SDP offer that the
related local preconditions for QoS are not met, using the segmented status
type, as defined in IETF RFC 3312 [23], as well as the strength-tag value
\"mandatory\" for the local segment and the strength-tag value \"optional\"
for the remote segment when sending the message to the succeeding 3GPP node.
Or the IWU may defer forwarding the SIP INVITE request until remote local
preconditions are met.
When the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that preconditions have not
been met and the IWU will not include a MGW the SDP with preconditions
information shall be transited unchanged and the \"precondition\" tag shall be
transited in the same header as received.
NOTE 1: The use of the SUPPORTED header is a deviation from IETF RFC 3312 [23]
when the strength-tag contains a \"mandatory\" value.
NOTE 2: The support of preconditions is mandated at the Nc interface.
Therefore a response without \"precondition\" can be considered as erroneous
if preconditions were not met.
NOTE 3: The setting of the \"Continuity Check Indicator\" in the \"Nature of
Connection Indicators\" parameter within the encapsulated IAM by the IWU is of
no significance. The value is ignored by the succeeding 3GPP node.
### 4.2.5 Support for Codec Negotiation
If the IWU uses the MGW bypass option as defined in TS 23.231 [3], then the
IWU is not involved in the codec negotiation procedure and transits SDP offers
and answers unchanged. Otherwise, the remaining text of this clause applies:
If the IWU receives from the external SIP-I based network a SIP request with
an SDP offer containing a codec list with or without the 3GPP_OoBTC_Indicator,
the IWU shall follow the procedures defined for a 3GPP Intermediate Node in
clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5].
If the IWU receives from the external SIP-I based network an INVITE or re-
INVITE request without any codec information, the IWU shall send an SDP offer
to the succeeding 3GPP SIP-I node, where it either shall follow the procedures
defined for a 3GPP node originating SDP offer in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5], or
shall create an SDP offer with the default PCM codec. The IWU shall send the
selected codec within an SDP offer towards the preceding external node.
NOTE: Which codecs are negotiable with the external SIP-I network may depend
on operator choices and preferences (local policy).
### 4.2.6 Special Procedures for the reception of SIP Re-INVITE requests
#### 4.2.6.1 Receipt of SIP Re-INVITE request without SDP
Upon receipt of a SIP Re-INVITE request without SDP, the IWU shall:
\- construct an SDP offer with contents reflecting the SDP already negotiated
with the external SIP-I network for the call, including codec information as
specified in clause 4.2.5, and send the SDP offer within a 200 OK (INVITE)
message to the external SIP-I network; or
\- reject the SIP Re-INVITE request.
## 4.3 Signalling Interworking of a Call from SIP-I based circuit-switched
core network towards the external SIP-I based network
### 4.3.1 Interworking of SIP-I messages received from preceding 3GPP node
#### 4.3.1.1 General
An IWU receiving SIP messages with encapsulated ISUP information shall apply
any interworking procedures detailed for Profile C in ITU-T Recommendation
Q.1912.5 [6] affecting parameters within the ISUP, and then proceed to
encapsulate any ISUP information received (with the exception of the excluded
messages detailed in 5.4.3 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6]) in a SIP
message in a MIME body according to IETF RFC 3204 [19]. The selected SIP
Header fields relating to the handling of the ISUP body shall be set as
specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
#### 4.3.1.2 Call Release from external SIP-I network when encapsulated REL is
missing
If the IWU receives a SIP BYE request or 4XX, 5XX, 6XX final response to the
initial INVITE request without an encapsulated ISUP REL message then the IWU
may construct the ISUP REL message according to the rules specified in ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] and encapsulate it into the SIP message, which is
sent to the preceding 3GPP node.
NOTE: A SIP BYE request without an encapsulated ISUP message can be received
from a CS-IBCF or from a node of an interconnect network when they initiate
autonomous call release. It is expected that a generated ISUP REL message
won\'t add any additional information which is not available in the received
SIP BYE request.
The IWU shall send a 200 OK final response to the BYE request without an
encapsulated ISUP RLC message towards the external SIP-I network.
### 4.3.2 Special Procedures for the reception of SIP INVITE requests
The IWU shall decapsulate the ISUP message. The IWU forwards the ISUP
information to the \"IW-MSC\" functions, which may result in a modified ISUP
message.
Based on configuration the IWU may choose to transcode media. If the IWU
transcodes, it should set the TMR/USI/HLC parameters according to the codec
applied in the SIP-I network. Otherwise, it should provide the TMR/USI/HLC
parameters as received in the encapsulated IAM.
The IWU shall proceed to encapsulate the ISUP message into the SIP-INVITE
request. The request URI shall be aligned with the called party number.
### 4.3.3 Special Procedures for Profile Interworking
#### 4.3.3.1 Support of 100Rel
An IWU shall consider an initial SIP INVITE request received from the
preceding 3GPP node without the tag \"100Rel\" in the SUPPORTED header or
REQUIRED header as erroneous and shall reject the call accordingly.
An IWU sending a SIP INVITE request towards the external SIP-I network shall
advertise its preference of provisional reliable responses via a SUPPORTED
header containing the tag \"100Rel\".
If an IWU receives a provisional 101-199 response from the external SIP-I
network with a REQUIRE header present with tag \"100rel\" then it shall
include the tag \"100Rel\" into the REQUIRE header when the IWU propagates the
response to the preceding 3GPP node.
If an IWU receives from the external SIP-I network a provisional 101-199
response without tag \"100rel\" in the REQUIRE header then the IWU shall:
\- either includes the tag \"100Rel\" into the REQUIRE header when it forwards
the response to the preceding 3GPP node,
\- or consider the response as erroneous and reject the call accordingly.
NOTE: The option to forward the response to the preceding 3GPP node without
tag \"100Rel\", if the external network does not support reliable provisional
responses, is not specified in the present specification.
#### 4.3.3.2 Support for UPDATE method
An IWU sending a SIP INVITE towards the external SIP-I network shall advertise
its support of the UPDATE method via the ALLOW header listing the UPDATE
method.
The IWU receiving a response to a SIP INVITE request is allowed to generate
the UPDATE method towards the external network if an ALLOW header is present
listing the UPDATE method. Otherwise, the IWU is not allowed to generate
UPDATE requests towards the external SIP-I network and one of the following
options applies:
\- The IWU shall return the response to the preceding 3GPP node containing an
ALLOW header listing the UPDATE method.
\- The IWU shall consider the response received from the external network as
erroneous and reject the call accordingly.
NOTE: The option to forward the response to the preceding 3GPP node without
UPDATE in the ALLOW header field, if the external network does not support the
UPDATE method, is not specified in the present specification.
#### 4.3.3.3 Support for Preconditions
When the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that preconditions have not
been met or when local preconditions are not met, the IWU shall use one of the
following options:
a) The IWU shall send a SIP INVITE request to a succeeding external SIP-I
network and include the tag \"precondition\" in the SUPPORTED header. The IWU
shall encode preconditions in the SDP offer indicating that the related local
preconditions for QoS are not met, using the segmented status type, as defined
in IETF RFC 3312 [23], as well as the strength-tag value \"mandatory\" for the
local segment and the strength-tag value \"optional\" for the remote segment.
The \"precondition\" tag shall be included in the SUPPORTED header. The IWU
shall encapsulate the IAM message into the SIP INVITE request and should
insert \"continuity check not required\" as the value of the Continuity check
indicator within the Nature of Connection Indicators parameter _in order to
avoid that an external node, which does not support preconditions, is waiting
for a COT message when the IWU is not able to send the COT message_.
NOTE 1: Such an external node is not compliant to ITU-T Recommendation
Q.1912.5 [6].
NOTE 2: The use of the SUPPORTED header is a deviation from IETF RFC 3312 [23]
when a \"mandatory\" strength-tag is used.
The subsequent action depends on whether the response indicates support of
preconditions:
i) If the IWU receives from the external SIP-I network a provisional 101-199
response with a REQUIRE header or SUPPORTED header containing tag
\"precondition\", then the IWU shall progress the call and when preconditions
are met it shall send an UPDATE message or PRACK message indicating that
preconditions have been fulfilled. Preconditions are fulfilled when local
preconditions are met and, if the incoming SIP INVITE request indicated that
preconditions had not been met, the IWU has received an indication from the
preceding 3GPP node that the preconditions are subsequently met.
ii) If the IWU receives from the external SIP-I network a provisional 101-199
response without a REQUIRE header or SUPPORTED header containing tag
\"precondition\" and if a provisional response or successful final response
carrying an encapsulated ISUP message is received from external SIP-I network
prior to preconditions being met, then these responses shall be queued and
later be propagated to the preceding 3GPP node once preconditions are met. If
responses carrying encapsulated ISUP are to be queued and the response
carrying an encapsulated ISUP message is the first response carrying an SDP
answer then the IWU shall generated a 183 Progress with the SDP answer and
send it to the preceding node. The IWU shall not encapsulate an ISUP message
into the 183 Progress.
NOTE 3: The option to allow the SIP response to be immediately forwarded is
not specified in the present will result in the O-MSC receiving encapsulated
ISUP prior to preconditions being met. In addition, reception of response
without indication of support for preconditions at the O-MSC is not specified
in the present specification.
If the IWU receives a failure response from the external network, then this
shall immediately be forwarded to the preceding 3GPP node.
b) Before sending the INVITE request to the external network the IWU shall
wait until local preconditions are met and, if the incoming SIP INVITE request
indicated that preconditions have not been met, it has received an indication
from the preceding 3GPP node that the preconditions are met.
> The initial INVITE request to the external SIP-I network may include a
> precondition tag in SUPPORTED header and indicate that preconditions have
> been met.
c) The IWU shall send a SIP INVITE request to a succeeding external SIP-I
network and include the tag \"precondition\" in the REQUIRE header. The IWU
shall encode preconditions in the SDP offer indicating that the related local
preconditions for QoS are not met, using the segmented status type, as defined
in IETF RFC 3312 [23], as well as the strength-tag value \"mandatory\" for the
local segment and the strength-tag value \"optional\" for the remote segment.
The IWU shall encapsulate the IAM message into the SIP INVITE request and
should insert \"continuity check not required\" as the value of the Continuity
check indicator within the Nature of Connection Indicators parameter _in order
to avoid that an external node, which does not support preconditions, is
waiting for a COT message when the IWU is not able to send the COT message_.
NOTE 4: Such an external node is not compliant to ITU-T Recommendation
Q.1912.5 [6].
The subsequent action depends on whether the response indicates support of
preconditions:
i) If the IWU receives from the external SIP-I network a provisional 101-199
response with a REQUIRE header or SUPPORTED header containing tag
\"precondition\", then the IWU shall continue the call per response handling
procedures described in option a) above.
ii) If the IWU receives a 420 Bad Extension final response, then the IWU shall
continue per option b) above by waiting for preconditions to be met before
repeating the initial INVITE request.
When the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that precondition are met and
local preconditions are met, the IWU shall set up the session and may include
a precondition tag in the SUPPORTED header and indicate that preconditions
have been met.
When the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that preconditions have not
been met and the IWU will not include a MGW the SDP with preconditions
information shall be transited unchanged and the \"precondition\" tag shall be
transited in the same header as received.
### 4.3.4 Support for Codec Negotiation
When the IWU receives an INVITE with an SDP offer containing a structured
codec list, the IWU shall follow the procedures defined for a 3GPP
Intermediate Node in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5], unless the IWU uses the MGW
bypass option.
NOTE: Which codecs are negotiable with the external SIP-I network may depend
on operator choices and preferences (local policy).
### 4.3.5 MGW Selection
The IWU shall not perform \"optimised MGW selection\", or \"deferred MGW
selection\" towards an external SIP-I network. The IWU shall select a MGW and
include the MGW connection address in the SDP offer of the initial SIP INVITE
request it sends to the external SIP-I network. The \"MGW bypass\" option may
be deployed but in the case that the preceding 3GPP node signals the MGW
identifier this identifier shall not be signalled to the external SIP-I
network.
## 4.4 DMTF Signalling Interworking applicable for all Calls between an
external SIP-I based network and a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network
### 4.4.1 General
DTMF signalling via the RTP Telephony Event (RTP Telephony Event) is mandated
to be supported over the Nb interface for SIP-I based Circuit Switched Core
Network on Nc Interface, see TS 23.231 [3].
NOTE 1: According to TS 23.231 [3] it is an option to choose either the RTP
Telephony Event or inband DTMF transport within the PCM codec when only the
default PCM codec is selected, however once RTP Telephony Event is chosen
(indicated in the SDP answer) it must be used for any selected codec.
If MGW bypass is supported within the CS CN (see TS 23.231 [3], clause 4.4.5),
a terminating MSC or a 3GPP SIP-I intermediate node controlling a MGW that
interfaces directly to the external network shall behave as an IWU, as its MGW
is providing an UP-IWU function and therefore the SIP-I Server shall also
comply with the procedures in this subclause. A GMSC Server or SIP-I
intermediate node which is applying the MGW Bypass option shall then relay the
SDP media lines for codecs and RTP Telephony Event in the SDP offers and
answers transparently between the external SIP-I network and the 3GPP CS CN
and is therefore not constrained by the procedures described in this
subclause.
If the SDP answer sent towards the external SIP-I network or received from the
external SIP-I network includes the RTP Telephony event, then the IWU shall
request its MGW to transmit and receive the DTMF to/from the external SIP-I
node within the RTP Telephony Event.
If the SDP answer sent towards or received from the SIP-I based CS CN includes
the RTP Telephony event, then the IWU shall request its MGW to transmit and
receive the DTMF to/from the SIP-I based CS CN within the RTP Telephony Event.
DTMF interworking is specified for interworking towards an external SIP-I
network with the assumption that the following applies:
\- External SIP-I network includes RTP Telephony event within SDP offers or
SDP answers together with non-PCM speech codecs;
\- External SIP-I network includes default PCM codec in SDP offers or SDP
answers.
Therefore only the case where the external SIP-I network includes default PCM
codec when not including the RTP Telephony event is described.
### 4.4.2 DTMF support in SDP offer sent to External SIP-I network
If an IWU receives an _initial_ SDP offer from a preceding 3GPP SIP-I node
with the RTP Telephony Event it shall forward the RTP Telephony Event in the
offer to the succeeding (external) node. If the IWU then receives a SDP answer
from the succeeding node (external network) including the RTP Telephony Event,
the IWU shall include the RTP Telephony Event in the SDP answer it forwards to
the SIP-I based CS CN independently of the selected codec type, i.e. any DTMF
payload received would then be simply relayed through the interworking MGW,
and the IWU shall also include the RTP-telephony event in possible subsequent
SDP offers it sends towards the succeeding external network node.
If an IWU receives an SDP offer from a preceding 3GPP SIP-I node without the
RTP Telephony Event (only permitted if only default PCM codec offered) then it
may:
\- Include additional non-PCM speech codecs and shall then include the RTP
Telephony Event in the subsequent offer to the succeeding external SIP-I node;
NOTE: If the answer from the external SIP-I node does not include the RTP
Telephony Event then no interworking of DTMF Telephony Events or tones is
required by the MGW.
or:
\- send the SDP Offer to the external SIP-I node without the RTP Telephony
Event (no compressed codecs included in the offer) and then no inband DTMF
detection/insertion is required; or:
\- Send the SDP Offer to the external SIP-I node without any additional non-
PCM speech codecs and include the RTP Telephony Event.
If the answer from the external SIP-I node includes the RTP Telephony event
and the RTP Telephony event has not been offered by the preceding 3GPP SIP-I
network then the IWU shall request its MGW (UP-IWU) to detect/insert inband
DTMF tones to/from its preceding 3GPP SIP-I node and send/receive the DTMF to
the external SIP-I node within the RTP Telephony Event, see clause 14.4.8 in
TS 23.231 [3],
If an IWU receives a SDP offer from a preceding 3GPP SIP-I node with the RTP
Telephony Event and then receives a SDP answer from the external SIP-I network
which includes only the PCM speech codec and excludes the RTP Telephony Event
the IWU may:
\- apply \"transcoding at the PLMN border\" by selecting another speech codec
than the default PCM codec for the interface toward the SIP-I based CS CN (if
included in the offer) and then the IWU shall include the RTP Telephony Event
in the answer it forwards to the SIP-I based CS CN, or:
\- select default PCM codec towards the SIP-I CS CN and may include the RTP
Telephony Event in the reply to the preceding (3GPP SIP-I) node and shall then
request its MGW to relay inband DTMF to the RTP Telephony Event to/from the
external network, see clause 14.4.8 in TS 23.231 [3], or:
\- select default PCM codec towards the SIP-I CS CN and exclude the RTP
Telephony Event in the reply to the preceding (3GPP SIP-I) node and then no
inband DTMF detection/insertion is required.
### 4.4.3 DTMF support in SDP offer received from External SIP-I network
If an IWU receives an SDP offer from the external SIP-I network with the RTP
Telephony Event it shall forward the RTP Telephony Event in the offer to the
succeeding node. If the SDP answer from the succeeding (3GPP internal) SIP-I
node includes the RTP Telephony Event the IWU shall configure its MGW to relay
the RTP Telephony Events transparently as described in clause 14.4.3 of TS
23.231 [3].
If an IWU receives a SDP offer from the external SIP-I network without the RTP
Telephony Event the IWU shall include the RTP Telephony Event in the offer to
the succeeding node if any codec other than the default PCM speech codec is
offered to the succeeding node. If only the default PCM speech codec is
offered to the succeeding node, the IWU may include the RTP Telephony Event in
the offer to the succeeding SIP-I CS CN node.
If the IWU receives a SDP answer from the succeeding (3GPP internal) SIP-I
node including the RTP Telephony Event and the RTP Telephony Event had not
been received in the offer from the external network the IWU returns the
default PCM codec in the SDP answer to the external SIP-I network. The IWU
shall then request its MGW (UP-IWU) to detect any inband DTMF from the
external SIP-I network and signal the DTMF to the succeeding 3GPP SIP-I node
within the RTP Telephony Event and insert DTMF tones into the external SIP-I
network if DTMF digits received via RTP Telephony Event from the succeeding
3GPP SIP-I node, see clause 14.4.8 in TS 23.231 [3].
If an IWU receives a SDP answer from the succeeding (3GPP internal) SIP-I node
excluding the RTP Telephony Event (i.e. default PCM codec selected) but
received an RTP Telephony Event in the SDP offer from the external SIP-I
network it may return RTP Telephony Event in the SDP answer to the external
SIP-I network. It shall then configure its MGW (UP-IWU) for transferring DTMF
between inband PCM and RTP Telephony Events as described in clause 14.4.8 in
TS 23.231 [3]. If the IWU chooses not to include the RTP Telephony Event in
the SDP answer then default PCM codec shall be signalled in the SDP answer to
the external SIP-I network. No inband DTMF detection or insertion is required;
any DTMF tones received are passed transparently inband.
If an IWU receives a SDP answer from the succeeding (3GPP internal) SIP-I node
excluding the RTP Telephony Event (i.e. default PCM codec selected) and did
not receive an RTP Telephony Event in the SDP offer from the external SIP-I
network the IWU returns the default PCM codec as the selected codec in the SDP
answer to the external network and shall not request its MGW to configure RTP
Telephony Event; therefore any inband DTMF tones are passed transparently
inband.
## 4.5 User Plane Interworking
### 4.5.1 General
Figure 4.5.1.1 shows the user plane protocol stacks within the external SIP-I
network and the 3GPP SIP-I based circuit switched core network.
Figure 4.5.1.1: user plane interworking
If the same speech codec is used on both sides, no speech transcoding is
required.
### 4.5.2 DTMF Interworking
For general information of DTMF interworking, see clause 4.4.1.
The IWU may configure its UP-IWU with RTP Telephony Event at the 3GPP SIP-I
termination and the external SIP-I termination. The UP-IWU shall then relay
any DTMF received within the RTP Telephony Event Payload Type from one network
interface to the other.
The IWU may configure the UP-IWU with only one network termination with RTP
Telephony Event and the other termination configured for default PCM. The UP-
IWU shall then detect DTMF tones from the PCM-encoded speech path and transmit
them as RTP Telephony Events toward the other network and shall detect RTP
Telephony Events and insert the DTMF as Tones in the corresponding PCM-encoded
path.
If the IWU does not configure RTP Telephony Event on either network
terminations then the UP-IWU simply relays the PCM-encoded speech from one
network to the other (which may contain and therefore relay DTMF tones).
If RTP Telephony Event is selected for either the external SIP-I connection or
for the internal 3GPP CS CN connection, but not for both, then the MGW shall
filter out (delete) the DTMF from the default PCM-coded speech path (when
relaying the DTMF via the RTP Telephony Event) to prevent potential double
signalling of the same digit if a later insertion back to inband DTMF tone
transmission were to occur.
The related UP-IWU control procedures and UP-IWU behaviour is described in
clauses 14.4.3 and 14.4.8 of TS 23.231 [3], where the MGW shall be understood
as UP-IWU.
## 4.6 Example Call flows
### 4.6.1 General
In this clause call flows are shown as examples to demonstrate the signalling
interworking of the IWU. Within the message sequence charts some content of
the messages are shown in order to visualise some of the important
interworking aspects, which were described in previous clauses of this
document. It is to be noted that the intention is neither to show the complete
content of the SIP messages nor to use the exact syntax of SIP and SDP
messages as it is defined in the respective RFCs. It is also not the intention
to show all alternative options that are possible for a certain call flow.
### 4.6.2 Incoming Call flows
#### 4.6.2.1 Incoming Call - no preconditions in external network
Figure 4.6.2.1.1 shows a terminating call where the external network does not
indicate the support of preconditions and where the SDP body contains a list
of codecs according to IETF RFC 3264 [22]. The IWU assumes that remote
preconditions are met. The incoming side RTP bearer termination is yet not
successfully reserved and configure and therefore local preconditions are not
met. Thus the IWU initiates precondition signalling when sending the INVITE
request to the succeeding 3GPP node. The IWU and the 3GPP node perform codec
negotiation according to 3GPP rules as specified in TS 23.153 [5]. The IWU
answers to the external network with a single selected codec. If possible the
selected codec is the same as received from the 3GPP node to avoid transcoding
at the network border.
The IWU changes the content of the Request URI (either a tel-URI or a SIP-URI
with \"user=phone\") from the MSISDN of the called subscriber to the MSRN
received from the HLR. The IWU inserts its own address into the From header of
the initial SIP INVITE request being sent to the succeeding 3GPP node.
Figure 4.6.2.1.1: Incoming Call (message sequence chart),\ example without
support for preconditions at the NNI
#### 4.6.2.2 Incoming Call with preconditions not met
In figure 4.6.2.2.1 the external network indicates that its preconditions are
not met. Because support for preconditions is mandated at the interface to the
succeeding 3GPP node, the IWU can immediately send the INVITE towards the
destination.
The IWU receives from the external network the information that preconditions
are met either in the PRACK or UPDATE request, where the SDP parameters are
set accordingly. The IWU sends the information that preconditions are met
either within the PRACK or with an UPDATE request to the 3GPP node such that
the called subscriber can be alerted.
Figure 4.6.2.2.1: Incoming Call (message sequence chart),\ example with
precondition update
### 4.6.3 Outgoing Call flows
#### 4.6.3.1 Outgoing Call with support for preconditions
Figure 4.6.3.1.1 shows an outgoing call where the preconditions are not met
when the IWU receives the initial SIP INVITE. Support for preconditions is
confirmed from the external network. Within this example the external node
provides a single codec, therefore no second SDP offer/answer is needed for
codec negotiation.
When the IWU receives from the preceding 3GPP node that preconditions are met,
then it informs the external node that called subscriber can be alerted with
an UPDATE request, where the SDP contains the appropriate precondition offer
and the selected codec.
Figure 4.6.3.1.1: Outgoing call (message sequence chart),\ example with
support for preconditions
#### 4.6.3.2 Outgoing Call with support of 100rel but no support for
preconditions
Figure 4.6.3.2.1 depicts an outgoing call where the external network supports
reliable provisional responses and the UPDATE method but does not support
preconditions. Therefore the IWU cannot exchange SDP precondition
offers/answers with the external node.
In this example the IWU receives more than one single codec in the 183
Progress from the external node. Therefore the IWU selects one of the received
codecs and makes a second SDP offer to the external node in the PRACK in order
to lock the codec.
The IWU receives a 180 Ringing provisional response from the external network
before preconditions are fulfilled. The IWU forwards the 180 Ringing response
after preconditions have been fulfilled.
NOTE 1: The IWU may also have received a successful final response to the
INVITE before preconditions have been met. In this case the forwarding of the
180 Ringing response and of the final successful response towards the
preceding 3GPP node is delayed until preconditions are fulfilled.
NOTE 2: As an alternative the IWU could send PRACK to the external node when
PRACK is received from the preceding 3GPP node acknowledging the 180 Ringing
response. Since the sending of the 180 Ringing response to the 3GPP network
may be delayed, this may lead to the retransmission of 180 Ringing response
sent by the external node.
Figure 4.6.3.2.1: Outgoing Call (message sequence chart),\ example with
support of 100rel but no support for preconditions
#### 4.6.3.3 Outgoing Call without support for 100rel and preconditions
Figure 4.6.3.3.1 depicts an outgoing call where the external network does not
support reliable provisional responses and therefore no SDP precondition
signalling can be performed with the UPDATE method. With the 183 Progress the
IWU receives an IETF codec list \"unreliably\". If the answer includes more
than one codec the IWU cannot make a second offer to the external node (to
lock the selected codec) during the early dialogue. However, the IWU can make
use of the received information and start codec negotiation when forwarding
the 183 Progress to the preceding 3GPP node.
The IWU immediately sends 200 OK to PRACKs received from the 3GPP node,
because it cannot forward them to the external node. The reliable provisional
responses cannot be signalled end-to-end.
The final response from the external network should include the same codecs as
received previously within the Progress message. If this answer includes more
than one codec the IWU makes a second offer to the external network with a re-
INVITE request.

support for 100rel and preconditions

ISUP based network
## 5.1 Reference Model
Figure 5.1.1 details the interworking reference model for clause 5 of the
present specification
NOTE: The IWU is a logical function that may reside with other 3GPP logical
functions in the same physical nodes, e.g. in an (G)MSC Server. The figure
shows only the logical separation.

TS 29.231 [4].
## 5.2 Control Plane Interworking
The following clauses define the signalling interworking between the ISDN User
Part (ISUP) protocols and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with its
associated Session Description Protocol (SDP) and encapsulated ISUP at an IWU.
The IWU shall act as a Type A or Type B exchange (ITU-T Recommendation Q.764
[7]) for the purposes of ISUP compatibility procedures.
NOTE: An IWU may apply additional procedures to support interworking for
national-specific capabilities.
The ISUP capabilities or signalling information defined for national use are
outside the scope of the present document.
The services that can be supported through the use of the signalling
interworking are limited to the services that are supported both within the
ISUP based network and the SIP-I based CS CN. The IWU will originate and/or
terminate services or capabilities that do not interwork seamlessly across
domains according to the relevant protocol recommendation or specification.
Table 5.2.1 lists the services seamlessly interworked within the scope of the
present document.

The clause 5.3.2 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] describes additional
general principles specific to SIP-I.
The interworking procedures in clauses 5.3, 5.4 and 5.4 are based on ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] profile C. Clarifications are made within this
specification on the application of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] profile
C.
The control plane between the ISUP network and the SIP-I based CN is as shown
in figure 5.2.1.

switched core network and an ISUP based network
## 5.3 Signalling Interworking of a Call from the ISUP based network towards
the SIP-I based circuit-switched core network
### 5.3.1 General
The procedures for Profile C in clause 7 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6]
shall be applied with the modifications provided in this subclause.
#### 5.3.1.1 Sending of ISUP information to adjacent SIP nodes
The IWU receiving ISUP information shall apply any interworking procedures
detailed in clause 7 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] affecting parameters
within the ISUP, and then proceed to encapsulate any ISUP information received
(with the exception of the excluded messages detailed in 5.4.3 of ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6]) in a SIP message in a MIME body according to IETF
RFC 3204 [19]. SIP Header fields relating to the handling of the ISUP body
shall be set as specified in clause 5.4.1.2 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5
[6].
NOTE 1: The text in the preceding paragraph has been derived from ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6], clause 5.4.1.
For a basic call setup, the SIP message used to encapsulate the ISUP message
shall be the SIP message that was first triggered to be sent from the IWU as a
result of the interworking specified in clause 7 of ITU-T Recommendation
Q.1912.5 [6]. As an example, this means that an ISUP IAM will be encapsulated
within the INVITE message that is sent out from the IWU. For the ISUP messages
listed in table 1 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6], the special procedures
in clause 5.4.3 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] are applicable.
NOTE 2: The text in the preceding paragraph has been derived from ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6], clause 5.4.1.3.
#### 5.3.1.2 Receipt of encapsulated ISUP information within SIP-I
On receipt of a SIP message containing encapsulated ISUP, the IWU shall
de‑encapsulate the ISUP message from the SIP message body. The received SIP
message shall be mapped to an ISUP message and merged with the de-encapsulated
ISUP information according to the rules in clause 7 of ITU-T Recommendation
Q.1912.5 [6].
NOTE 1: The text in the preceding paragraph has been derived from ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6], clause 5.4.2.
NOTE 2: These precedence rules have been derived from the following
principles, which can also be applied for any ISUP information not covered by
the present specification:
> 1 Where a SIP header mapping to ISUP field(s) is possible (for example the
> mapping of Request‑URI to Called Party Number), the SIP header is given
> precedence over the encapsulated ISUP value in the alignment process.
> (Conflicts can be caused by a possible service invocation within the SIP
> network.)
>
> 2 De-encapsulated ISUP information overrides ISUP information derived from
> default values (rather than SIP information).
>
> 3 Local ISUP procedures may modify information derived from SIP or default
> values.
>
> This Note has been derived from text in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6],
> clause 5.4.2
NOTE 3: There is a certain change against ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6],
where the above note is formulated as normative procedures. However, this is
very high level and not required if you look at the real interworking
procedures later on. Therefore formulating this as a Note makes much more
sense.
#### 5.3.1.3 Special procedures related to outgoing INVITE
##### 5.3.1.3.1 Overlap Signalling
The IWU does not need to support procedures related to overlap signalling in
clause 7 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
NOTE: No overlap signalling is used in a 3GPP CS domain. A G-MSC acting as IWU
will collect all digits required to identify the called party and not
propagate the overlap signalling further.
##### 5.3.1.3.2 Coding of encapsulated ISUP IAM parameters in outgoing INVITE
The IWU may choose to transcode media, or attempt to interwork media without
transcoding. If the IWU transcodes, it should set the TMR/USI/HLC parameters
according to the codec applied in the SIP-I network. Otherwise, it should
provide the TMR/USI/HLC parameters as received in the incoming IAM. If the IWU
offers several codecs within SDP, it should set the TMR/USI/HLC parameters
according to the preferred codec, applying the rules above for this codec.
NOTE: ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] does not describe the relationship
between TMR/USI/HLC and SDP codec negotiation.
##### 5.3.1.3.3 Media offered in SDP of outgoing INVITE
The IWU should offer codecs known to be supported within the SIP-I based CS CN
network. If multiple speech codecs are offered, Out of Band Transcoder Control
(OoBTC) procedures shall be applied by the IWU in accordance with TS 23.153
[5]. Otherwise only the default PCM speech codec shall be signalled in an SDP
offer; auxiliary payload types such as the Telephony Event RTP payload type
may be included in addition.
If the IWU applies the optional \"optimised MGW selection\" procedure, it
shall include a MGW Identifier in the SDP. Related signalling procedures are
described in clause 4.4 of TS 23.231 [3] and the encoding of the MGW
Identifier is defined in TS 29.231 [4].
## 5.4 Signalling Interworking of a Call from SIP-I based circuit-switched
core network towards the ISUP based network
### 5.4.1 General
The procedures for Profile C in clause 6 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6]
shall be applied with the modifications provided in this subclause.
### 5.4.2 Interworking of received ISUP messages to SIP messages
The IWU receiving backwards ISUP information shall apply any interworking
procedures detailed in clause 6 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] affecting
parameters within the ISUP, and then proceed to encapsulate any ISUP
information received (with the exception of the excluded messages detailed in
5.4.3 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6]) in a SIP message in a MIME body
according to IETF RFC 3204 [19]. The selected SIP Header fields relating to
the handling of the ISUP body shall be set as specified in clause 5.4.1.2 of
ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
### 5.4.3 Interworking of received SIP messages to ISUP messages
#### 5.4.3.1 Receipt of encapsulated ISUP information within SIP
On receipt of a SIP message containing encapsulated ISUP, the IWU shall
de‑encapsulate the ISUP message from the SIP message body. The received SIP
message shall be mapped to an ISUP message and merged with the de-encapsulated
ISUP message according to the rules for Profile C in clause 6 of ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
NOTE 1: These precedence rules have been derived from the following
principles, which can also be applied for any ISUP information not covered by
the present specification:
> 1 Where a SIP header mapping to ISUP field(s) is possible (for example the
> mapping of Request‑URI to Called Party Number), the SIP header is given
> precedence over the encapsulated ISUP value in the alignment process.
>
> 2 De-encapsulated ISUP information overrides ISUP information derived from

> 3 Local ISUP procedures may modify information derived from SIP or default
> values.
>
> This note has been derived from text in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6],

NOTE 2: There is a certain change against ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6],
where the above note is formulated as normative procedures. However, this is
very high level and not required if you look at the real interworking
procedures later on. Therefore formulating this as a note makes much more
sense.

##### 5.4.3.2.1 Propagation of overlap signalling toward the 3GPP CS domain
The procedures in clause 6 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] related to the
propagation of overlap signalling are not applicable, since no overlap
signalling is used within the CS CN.
##### 5.4.3.2.2 Derivation of TMR, USI and HLC parameters within sent IAM
message
The IWU may choose to transcode media and shall then set the parameters
according to the coding applied within the CS Domain. Otherwise, the IWU shall
select a codec for the SIP side termination using SDP offer-answer procedures,
IETF RFC 3264 [22], and shall map the SDP information of this codec to the
TMR/USI/HLC parameters according to table 2a of TS 29.163 [13]. If the
information derived from this mapping matches the information in the
TMR/USI/HLC parameters in the encapsulated ISUP, the TMR/USI/HLC parameters
from the encapsulated ISUP should be used as they may contain additional
information. If the information derived from this mapping contradicts the
information in the TMR/USI/HLC parameters in the encapsulated ISUP, the
TMR/USI/HLC parameters derived by the mapping shall be used.
NOTE: The procedures in this note are an amendment compared to ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6], which simply states the TMR parameters in
encapsulated ISUP shall take precedence, However this is inappropriate if an
incompatible codec is selected.
##### 5.4.3.2.3 Receipt of SIP INVITE without SDP offer
An IWU may reject receipt of SIP INVITE without SDP offer, otherwise the
procedures in section 4.2.2.3 shall be followed.
NOTE: A SIP INVITE without SDP offer is not used within the CS CN.
##### 5.4.3.2.4 Special Procedures for deferred MGW selection procedure.
If the IWU supports the optional \"deferred MGW selection\" procedure and
receives an unspecified connection address in the SDP offer contained in the
INVITE request, it should include a MGW Identifier for the IWU-UP it selects
in the corresponding SDP answer. Related signalling procedures are described
in clause 4.4 of TS 23.231 [3] and the encoding of the MGW Identifier is
defined in TS 29.231 [4].
## 5.5 Supplementary services
### 5.5.1 Special procedures for supplementary service interworking
The supplementary services described in table 5.2.1 are interworked by using
the parameters of the (de)encapsulated ISUP. No other interworking is
required, except if otherwise described within the clauses below.
### 5.5.2 Interworking of CLIP/CLIR supplementary service
For the interworking of call towards the SIP-I based CS CN: the service shall
be supported by encapsulation.
For the interworking of call from the SIP-I based CS CN: ITU-T Recommendation
Q.1912.5 [6], Annex B.1, shall apply.
### 5.5.3 Interworking of Call Hold (HOLD) supplementary service
The Profile C procedures in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6], clause B.10,
shall be followed.
### 5.5.4 Interworking of Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
supplementary service to SIP networks
The Profile C procedures of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6], clause B.11
shall be applied.
## 5.6 User Plane Interworking
### 5.6.1 General
This clause describes user plane issues including interworking of DTMF.
Figure 5.6.1.1 shows the user plane protocol stacks within the SIP-I based CS
CN and an ISUP network.
Apart from speech codecs, data call related codecs, e.g. as listed in table 2a
of TS 29.163 [13], may be used.
Figure 5.6.1.1: User Plane Interworking and ISUP based CS Domain
### 5.6.2 DTMF
If RTP Telephony Event is selected by the 3GPP CS CN the MGW shall filter out
(delete) the DTMF from the default PCM codec when relaying the DTMF via the
RTP Telephony Event to prevent potential double signalling of the same digit
if a later insertion back to inband PCM transmission were to occur.
## 5.7 Example Call flows
The call flow examples in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] Appendix III are
applicable with the following exceptions for the reasons specified:
\- III.2.1.1 En bloc, subscriber free indication - flow does not include use
of reliable provisional response within the SIP-I network
\- III.2.1.2 En bloc, early ACM - flow does not include use of reliable
provisional response within the SIP-I network
\- III.2.1.3 En bloc, early media scenario - flow does not include use of
reliable provisional response within the SIP-I network
\- III.2.1.4 En bloc, simple segmentation procedures - flow does not include
use of reliable provisional response within the SIP-I network
\- III.2.1.10 Overlap signalling - 3GPP G-MSC will collect all digits before
continuing the call
\- III.2.2.1 Backward release during call setup - flow does not include use of
reliable provisional response within the SIP-I network
# 6 Interworking between a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network and a
BICC based network
## 6.1 Reference Model
Figure 6.1.1 details the interworking reference model for clause 6 of the
present specification.
NOTE: The IWU is a logical function that may reside with other 3GPP logical
functions in the same physical nodes, e.g. in an (G)MSC Server. The figure
shows only the logical separation.
Figure 6.1.1: interworking reference model
**Nb reference point:** The Nb reference point is defined in accordance with
TS 29.414 [43].
**Nc reference point** : The Nc reference point is defined in accordance with
TS 29.231 [4].
## 6.2 Control Plane Interworking
### 6.2.1 General
The following clauses define the signalling interworking between the Bearer
Independent Call Control (BICC) protocol (see ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.1 to
Q.1902.6 [8]) and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with its associated
Session Description Protocol (SDP) and encapsulated ISUP at an IWU.
The IWU shall act as a Type A or Type B exchange (ITU-T Recommendation Q.764
[7]) for the purposes of ISUP compatibility procedures.
The BICC capabilities or signalling information defined for national use are
outside the scope of the present document.
NOTE: An IWU may apply additional procedures to support interworking for
national-specific capabilities.
The services that can be supported through the use of the signalling
interworking are limited to the services that are supported both within the
BICC based network and the SIP-I based CS CN. The IWU will originate and/or
terminate services or capabilities that do not interwork seamlessly across
domains according to the relevant protocol recommendation or specification.
Table 5.2.1 in clause 5.2 lists the services seamlessly interworked within the
scope of the present document.
The clause 5.3.2 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] describes additional
general principles specific to SIP-I.
The interworking procedures in the clauses 6.3 and 6.4 are based on ITU-T
Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] profile C. Clarifications are made within this
specification on the application of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6] profile
C. Specific rules for handling of the APM mechanism have been added, which are
not specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
### 6.2.2 Signalling interactions between network entities in the control
plane
The control plane between a SIP-I based CS core networks and a BICC based
network, where the underlying signalling transport is either IP or ATM
respectively, is shown in figures 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2.
Figure 6.2.2.1: Control plane interworking between SIP-I based CS CN\ and a
BICC based network with IP signalling transport
Figure 6.2.2.2: Control plane interworking between SIP-I based CS CN\ and a
BICC based network with ATM signalling transport
Signalling between the SIP-I based CS CN and the Interworking Unit uses the
services of IP (IETF RFC 791 [14] or IETF RFC 2460 [17]), SCTP (IETF RFC 4960
[18]) and SIP-I.
## 6.3 Signalling Interworking of a Call from the BICC based network towards
the SIP-I based circuit-switched core network
The procedures in clause 5.3 shall be applied with the modifications provided
in the present subclause.
The text in clause 5.3 is to be understood as follows:
\- Where \"ISUP\" is mentioned, this shall be understood as BICC. As an
exception, references to ISUP encapsulated within SIP-I shall be understood
without modification, i.e. they still refer to ISUP rather than BICC.
If an IAM message is received, the APM information elements (see ITU-T
Recommendation Q.765 [27]) relating to the BICC APM user (see ITU-T
Recommendation Q.765.5 [28]) shall be removed before the IAM message is
encapsulated in the triggered SIP INVITE message.
An APM message received from the CS side (see ITU-T Recommendation Q.765 [27])
that relates to the BICC APM user (see ITU-T Recommendation Q.765.5 [28])
shall not be encapsulated in any triggered SIP message.
## 6.4 Signalling Interworking of a Call from SIP-I based circuit-switched
core network towards the BICC based network
The procedures in clause 5.4 shall be applied with the modifications provided
in the present subclause.
The text in clause 5.4 is to be understood as follows:
\- Where \"ISUP\" is mentioned, this shall be understood as BICC. As an
exception, references to ISUP encapsulated within SIP-I shall be understood
without modification, i.e. they still refer to ISUP rather than BICC.
An APM message received from the BICC side (see ITU-T Recommendation Q.765
[27]) that relates to the BICC APM user (see ITU-T Recommendation Q.765.5
[28]) shall not be encapsulated in any triggered SIP message.
## 6.5 Supplementary services
The procedures in clause 5.5 shall be applied.
## 6.6 Codec Negotiation between a BICC based network and a SIP-I based
circuit-switched core network
### 6.6.1 General
The procedures in Annex B of TS 29.163 [13] shall be applied with the
modifications provided in the following clauses.
The text in Annex B of TS 29.163 [13] is to be understood as follows:
\- Where \"MGCF\" is mentioned, this shall be understood as IWU.
\- Where \"IM-MGW\" is mentioned, this shall be understood as UP-IWU.
\- Where \"IM CN subsystem\" is mentioned, this shall be understood as SIP-I
based circuit-switched core network.
The offer/answer procedures of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for
media negotiation shall be applied as specified in TS 29.231 [4].
### 6.6.2 Codec Negotiation from SIP-I on Nc to BICC Network
#### 6.6.2.1 Sending of IAM
When the IWU receives an initial INVITE request with SDP offer containing a
codec list with the 3GPP_OoBTC_Indicator, the procedures defined for a 3GPP
node terminating SDP offer in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5] shall be applied. The
IWU shall follow the procedures of clause B.2.5 of TS 29.163 [13] to create a
Supported Codec List for transmission in the outgoing IAM.
#### 6.6.2.2 Sending of SDP Answer
When the IWU receives the backward codec information, it shall apply the
procedure defined in the clause B.2.1.2 of TS 29.163 [13] and shall create the
SDP answer in accordance with the procedures defined for a 3GPP node
terminating SDP offer in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5].
#### 6.6.2.3 Mid-call Codec Negotiation initiated from SIP-I on Nc
When the mid-call codec negotiation is initiated from the SIP-I based CS CN
side the IWU:
\- shall apply the procedures defined for a 3GPP node terminating SDP offer in
clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5] for the SIP-I based CS CN side, and
\- shall apply the procedures from the clause B.2.3 of TS 29.163 [13] for the
BICC network side.
### 6.6.3 Codec Negotiation from BICC Network to SIP-I on Nc
#### 6.6.3.1 Sending of initial SDP Offer
When the IWU receives an IAM, the IWU shall follow the procedures of clause
B.2.5 of TS 29.163 [13] to convert the Supported Codec List from the IAM into
an SDP offer for transmission in the outgoing INVITE request. When generating
the initial SDP offer, the IWU shall apply the procedures defined for a 3GPP
node originating SDP offer in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5].
#### 6.6.3.2 Responding to Serving Node initiating Codec Negotiation
When the IWU receives the SDP answer it shall select a codec configuration for
the SIP-I based CS CN side in accordance with clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5]. For
the BICC network side the IWU shall apply the procedure defined in the clause
B.2.2.2 of TS 29.163 [13].
#### 6.6.3.3 Mid-call Codec Negotiation initiated from BICC
When the mid-call codec negotiation is initiated from the BICC side the IWU:
\- shall apply the procedures from the clause B.2.4 of TS 29.163 [13] for the
BICC network side, and
\- shall apply the procedures defined for a 3GPP node originating SDP offer in
clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5] for the SIP-I based CS CN side.
## 6.7 DMTF Signalling Interworking applicable for all Calls between a BICC
network and a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network
### 6.7.1 General
DTMF signalling via the RTP telephony-event is mandated to be supported over
the Nb interface for SIP-I based Circuit Switched Core Network on Nc
Interface, see TS 23.231 [3]. However it is an option to use this transmission
method when only the default PCM codec selected.
BICC over Nc supports both inband DTMF and DTMF via OoB signalling within the
BICC APM, see TS 23.205 [9]. If OoBTC is supported then use of OoB DTMF is
mandated, see TS 23.153 [5]. External BICC networks may also transport DTMF
either inband or via OoB signalling within the BICC APM.
If the usage of the RTP Telephony Event has been negotiated within the SIP-I
based CS CN, the IWU shall configure this payload type at the UP-IWU.
### 6.7.2 DTMF transfer from SIP-I on Nc to BICC network (Out-of-Band DTMF)
If RTP Telephony Event has been selected for the 3GPP SIP-I CS CN and OoB DTMF
transmission is required in the succeeding BICC network the IWU shall use the
Detect DTMF procedure to request the MGW to report DTMF Digits as described in
clause 14.4.6 of TS 23.231 [3], i.e. RTP Telephony Event is configured in
addition to the Detect DTMF Event. An example for the interworking with
explicit duration reporting in BICC is shown in figure 6.7.2.1.
NOTE 1: If the implicit duration is reported via the BICC Out Of Band
procedure it can result in the duration being shorter than the original
duration of the DTMF received at the MGW and even shorter than the minimum
duration required by TS 23.014 [24].
An example for the interworking with implicit duration reporting in BICC is
shown in figure 6.7.2.2.
NOTE 2: Support of \"start of DTMF detection\" is optional for the MGW (UP-
IWU).
Figure 6.7.2.1: DTMF interworking: SIP-I to BICC, explicit duration (message
sequence chart)
{width="6.125in" height="2.6847222222222222in"}
Figure 6.7.2.2: DTMF interworking: SIP-I to BICC, implicit duration (message
sequence chart)
If RTP Telephony Event has not been selected on 3GPP SIP-I CS CN interface and
OoB DTMF is required in the BICC network the IWU shall request inband DTMF
detection as described in clause 14.4.2.1 of TS 23.205 [9], i.e. the RTP
Telephony Event is not configured. The same principles apply for signalling
implicit or explicit DTMF digits.
### 6.7.3 DTMF transfer from BICC network (Out-of-Band DTMF) to SIP-I on Nc
If RTP Telephony Event has been selected for the 3GPP SIP-I CS CN and OoB DTMF
transmission is selected in the succeeding BICC network the IWU shall use the
\"Send DTMF\" procedure and may use the \"Stop DTMF\" procedures to request
the MGW to play out DTMF to the IM CN subsystem whenever it receives out-of-
band DTMF indications from the BICC network.
The UP-IWU (MGW) shall signal the RTP Telephony event(s) in accordance with
clause 14.4.4 of TS 23.231 [3].
If implicit DTMF timing is deployed (as shown in example message sequence
chart in figure 6.7.3.1) and the MGW has already completed the digit
transmission it shall not take any action upon the reception of the Stop DTMF
procedure.
Figure 6.7.3.1: DTMF Interworking: BICC to SIP-I, implicit duration (message
sequence chart)
### 6.7.4 SIP-I on Nc interworking with BICC for Inband DTMF
The interworking between inband and out-of-band transport shall be performed
according to clause 14.4.8 in TS 23.231 [3], if required.
If the RTP Telephony event has not been negotiated within the SIP-I based CS
CN, the interworking MSC towards a BICC network with inband DTMF transport
shall not configure the RTP Telephony event at the attached MGW. The MGW will
then transfer DTMF within the speech codec without detecting it.
## 6.8 User Plane Interworking
### 6.8.1 General
This clause describes user plane issues including interworking of DTMF.
### 6.8.2 DTMF Interworking
If RTP Telephony Event is selected for the internal 3GPP CS CN connection and
inband DTMF is selected for the BICC network the MGW shall filter out (delete)
the DTMF from the default PCM codec when relaying the DTMF via the RTP
Telephony Event to prevent potential double signalling of the same digit if a
later insertion back to inband PCM transmission were to occur.
## 6.9 Example Call flows
See clause 5.7.
# 7 Interworking between a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network and the
IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) Subsystem
## 7.1 Reference Model
### 7.1.1 General
Figure 7.1.1.1 details the reference model required to support interworking
between the 3GPP IM CN subsystem, as specified in TS 23.228 [11] and TS 24.229
[12] and a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network, as specified in TS
23.231 [3] and TS 29.231 [4].
NOTE 1: The IM-MGW may be connected via the Mb to various network entities,
such as a UE (via a GTP Tunnel to a GGSN), an MRFP, or an application server.

### 7.1.2 Signalling interactions between network entities in the control
plane
The control plane between the IM CN Subsystem supporting SIP and a 3GPP CS
network supporting a SIP-I based Nc interface is as shown in figure 7.1.2.
Figure 7.1.2.1: Control plane interworking protocol stack between the IM CN
subsystem and a 3GPP CS network supporting SIP-I based Nc interface
Signalling between the SIP signalling function and the MGCF uses the services
of IP (RFC 2460 [17]), and transport protocol such as TCP (RFC 793 [16]) or
UDP (RFC 768 [15]) or SCTP (RFC 4960 [18]) (see TS 24.229 [12]), and SIP.
Signalling between the SIP-I signalling function and the MGCF uses the
services of IP (IETF RFC 791 [14] or IETF RFC 2460 [17]), SCTP (IETF RFC 4960
[18]) and SIP-I.
## 7.2 Signalling Interworking of a Call from the IP Multimedia Subsystem
towards the SIP-I based circuit-switched core network
### 7.2.1 General
If not otherwise stated within this clause the MGCF shall follow the below
listed procedures for interworking incoming SIP calls:
Sending SIP messages to the succeeding SIP-I based circuit-switched core
network:
\- When an incoming SIP message is received from the preceding IMS node then
the MGCF shall send this SIP message to the succeeding SIP-I based circuit-
switched core network unless otherwise specified in the clauses below.
\- The MGCF shall only send SIP methods, SIP headers, SDP body contents and
other bodies as permitted by the profile for SIP-I on Nc as defined in TS
29.231 [4].
\- The MGCF shall, if defined by TS 29.163 [13], generate an ISUP message
following TS 29.163 [13] and include this ISUP message into the SIP message in
a MIME body according to IETF RFC 3204 [19]. The Content‑Type header field and
the Content‑Disposition header field shall be set as specified in clause
5.4.1.2 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
Sending SIP messages to the preceding IMS node:
\- When the MGCF receives a SIP-I message from the succeeding SIP-I based
circuit-switched core network then the MGCF shall send this message to the
preceding IMS node unless otherwise specified in the clauses below.
\- The MGCF shall only send SIP methods, SIP headers, SDP body contents and
other bodies which are permitted by the IMS profile as defined in TS 24.229
[12].
\- The MGCF shall construct IMS specific headers and bodies according to the
procedures defined in TS 29.163 [13].
### 7.2.2 Exceptions from forwarding received SIP messages
If call clearing is initiated either from the preceding IMS network or from
the succeeding SIP-I based circuit switched core network then the MGCF shall
apply the call clearing procedures as defined within TS 23.231 [3] clause
7.3.1.
When a BYE request, 4xx, 5xx or 6xx final response to an initial INVITE
request is received from the succeeding SIP-I based circuit switched core
network and if a Reason Header field was not received and encapsulated ISUP
REL message is included, then the ISUP Cause value received in the
encapsulated ISUP REL message shall be mapped into SIP Reason header fields as
specified in TS 29.163 [13]. If SIP message did not contain neither a Reason
header nor encapsulated ISUP REL message, then a 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx final
response shall be mapped to an ISUP cause value as specified in TS 29.163 [13]
table 18 or BYE request shall be mapped to cause value 16; this cause value
shall be mapped into the SIP Reason header fields as specified in TS 29.163
[13].
When a SIP failure response to an initial INVITE request is to be sent to the
preceding IMS node, the cause value contained in the Reason header to be sent
shall be used to determine the SIP failure response code as specified in TS
29.163 [13] table 9.
If different SIP methods are used within the SIP-I based circuit switched core
network and within the IMS network for basic call signalling or supplementary
service signalling, then the MGCF shall map the received SIP message into the
appropriate SIP message of the network the message is sent to.
If the interworking procedures within TS 29.163 [13] do not result in any
mapping then the MGCF shall not send the SIP message, which is received either
from the SIP-I based circuit switched core network or from the IMS network,
towards the other side.
If the MGCF supports overlap signalling from the preceding IMS node and the
first incoming SIP INVITE request does not provide a complete number, then the
MGCF shall not forward this first SIP INVITE request and additional SIP INVITE
requests or SIP INFO requests, which are used by the MGCF to collect all
digits required to identify the called subscriber.
The MGCF shall generate 100 Trying provisional SIP responses to acknowledge
the receipt of INVITE requests. The MGCF shall not forward received 100 Trying
provisional SIP responses.
### 7.2.3 Sending SIP INVITE request
The MGCF may reject receipt of SIP INVITE without SDP offer. Otherwise the
MGCF shall construct an SDP offer with contents according to local policy,
e.g. SDP for a G.711 speech call, in accordance with the built encapsulated
IAM message. In the constructed SDP offer the MGCF shall encode preconditions
as not met.
NOTE 1: A SIP-I INVITE **always includes an SDP** offer within the CS CN.
The MGCF shall forward the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer and
encapsulate an IAM message after the reception of the SIP INVITE request
irrespective of the status of local and remote preconditions:
When the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that remote preconditions are
not met or when local preconditions are not met then the MGCF shall include
the tag \"precondition\" in the SUPPORTED header and shall encode
preconditions in the SDP offer that the related local preconditions for QoS
are not met.
If the incoming SIP INVITE request indicates that remote preconditions are
met, or if the incoming SIP INVITE request does not contain a precondition
tag, and if local preconditions are met then the MGCF may either not include
the tag \"precondition\" and exclude appropriate SDP lines, or include the tag
\"preconditions\" in the SUPPORTED header and provide an SDP offer indicating
that preconditions are met.
NOTE 2: The use of SUPPORTED header is a deviation from IETF RFC 3312 [23]
when the strength-tag contains a \"mandatory\" value.
NOTE 3: The setting of the \"Continuity Check Indicator\" in the \"Nature of
Connection Indicators\" parameter within the encapsulated IAM is of no
significance. The value is ignored by the succeeding node of the SIP-I based
circuit-switched core network.
The MGCF shall not use the MGW bypass option, because some functions will not
work as the succeeding SIP-I node does not know that it is interworking any
IMS function. For example an incoming multimedia call from IMS does not result
in a CS multimedia telephony service on the SIP-I based circuit switched core
network.
If the incoming SIP INVITE request does not provide a complete number, then
the MGCF shall defer sending the SIP INVITE request until the MGCF has
collected all digits required to identify the called subscriber. The
additional digits may either, as a network option, be received in in-dialog
SIP INFO requests or in additional SIP INVITE requests with the same Call‑ID
and From tag as a previous SIP INVITE. The MGCF shall apply the signalling
procedures on the IMS side as specified in TS 29.163 [13].
### 7.2.4 Updating Precondition Information
If the MGCF previously indicated to the succeeding SIP-I based circuit-
switched core network that preconditions were not met, the MGCF shall send to
the succeeding SIP-I based circuit-switched core network appropriate SDP lines
indicating that local preconditions are met
\- when the MGCF receives from the preceding IMS network SDP indication that
preconditions are met and local preconditions are met,
\- or when remote preconditions at the preceding IMS network were already met
and local precondition status of the MGCF changes to be met.
NOTE: ISUP COT is not supported within SIP-I on Nc and therefore the ISUP COT
message shall not be included into the SIP message.
### 7.2.5 SDP Codec Negotiation
When sending an SDP offer/answer to negotiate codecs with the succeeding SIP-I
based circuit-switched core network the MGCF shall follow the procedures
defined for a 3GPP Intermediate Node in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5].
When sending an SDP offer/answer to negotiate codecs with the preceding IMS
network the MGCF shall send codec information in accordance to TS 24.229 [12].
NOTE 1: Which codecs are negotiable with the IMS network may depend on
operator choices and preferences (local policy).
### 7.2.6 MGW Selection
If the MGCF supports either the optional \"Optimised MGW Selection\" or the
optional \"Deferred MGW Selection\" then the MGCF may include the SDP MGW
Identifier into the SIP message being sent to the succeeding SIP-I based
circuit switched core network in accordance to clause 4.4 of TS 23.231 [3].
Otherwise the MGCF shall seize a MGW and shall include the MGW connection
address into the SDP offer of the initial SIP INVITE request it will send to
the succeeding 3GPP SIP-I based circuit switched core network node.
### 7.2.7 Autonomous Release
For interworking towards the preceding IMS node the MGCF shall use the
procedure as defined in TS 29.163 [13].
For call clearing towards the succeeding SIP-I based circuit switched core
network the MGCF shall use the procedures as defined within TS 23.231 [3]
clause 7.3.
### 7.2.8 Further setting of SIP header values
The MGCF shall act as a B2BUA as defined in IETF RFC 3261 [20]. The MGCF shall
terminate the incoming SIP session and the MGCF shall originate an outgoing
SIP-I call towards the SIP-I based circuit switched core network. Therefore
the MGCF shall generate the SIP headers and values of Cseq, Call-ID, Via,
Record-Route, Route and Contact independently from the received SIP message.
For the generation of the Request-URI of an initial INVITE request and header
fields To, From, Max-Forwards, and P-Asserted-Identity the MGCF shall use the
information received from the preceding IMS node and perform the procedures
specified below.
The Request-URI of in-dialogue SIP requests will be populated with information
received within the Contact header of previous responses according to SIP
procedures. When sending a request towards the SIP-I based circuit switched
core network the MGCF shall generate a From tag independent of the value
received from the IMS. Furthermore, when sending a response towards the IMS,
the MGCF shall generate a To tag independent of the value received from the
SIP-I based circuit switched core network.
The procedures for population of the Request-URI and header fields To, From,
Max-Forwards, and P-Asserted-Identity are based on the mapping procedures
specified in TS 29.163 [13]. The text in TS 29.163 [13] is to be understood as
follows:
\- Where ISUP called party number is mentioned, this shall be understood as
internal ISUP called party number.
\- Where ISUP calling party number is mentioned, this shall be understood as
internal ISUP calling party number.
\- Where ISUP Generic Number (additional calling party number) is mentioned,
this shall be understood as internal Generic Number (additional calling party
number).
\- Where ISUP Hop Counter parameter is mentioned, this shall be understood as
internal ISUP Hop Counter parameter.
NOTE: Only the userinfo component of the received SIP URI is used by mapping
procedures according to TS 29.163 [13] while the received host part is ignored
and a new value is generated by the MGCF.
When sending an initial INVITE request towards the SIP-I based circuit
switched core network the MGCF shall perform the following actions to generate
the Request-URI and the To header field:
\- Create an internal ISUP called party number from the received Request URI
according to TS 29.163 [13]. When Number Portability is supported the MGCF
shall follow the procedures specified in clause 7.2.3.1.2A of TS 29.163 [13].
Otherwise the ISUP called party number is generated as specified in clause
7.2.3.1.2.1 of TS 29.163 [13].
\- Generate the new Request-URI and the new To header field from the internal
ISUP called party number according to TS 29.163 [13].\ When Number Portability
is supported the MGCF shall follow the procedures specified in clause
7.2.3.2.2A of TS 29.163 [13]. Otherwise the Request-URI and the To header
field are generated as specified in clause 7.2.3.2.2.1 of TS 29.163 [13].
When sending an initial INVITE request towards the SIP-I based circuit
switched core network the MGCF shall perform the following actions to generate
the P-Asserted-Identity and the From header fields:
\- create an internal ISUP calling party number and an internal Generic Number
(additional calling party number) as specified in clauses 7.2.3.1.2.6 and
7.2.3.1.2.7of TS 29.163 [13]; and
\- generate the new P-Asserted-Identity and the From header from the internal
ISUP calling party number and the internal Generic Number (additional calling
party number) as specified in clause 7.2.3.2.2.3 of TS 29.163 [13].
When sending the initial SIP INVITE request to the SIP-I based circuit-
switched core network and if the Hop Counter procedure is supported in the
SIP-I based circuit switched core network (national option), then the MGCF
shall perform the following actions:
\- create an internal ISUP Hop Counter parameter from the received Max-
Forwards value according to clause 7.2.3.1.2.9 of TS 29.163 [13]; and
\- either generate the new Max-Forwards value from the internal ISUP Hop
Counter parameter by applying the rules in clause 7.2.3.2.2.4 of TS 29.163
[13] and decrementing the resulting value by one or forward the received Max-
Forwards value decremented by one.
Otherwise if the MGCF forwards SIP request, it shall either set the Max-
Forwards header to a default value or forward the received Max-Forwards value
decremented by one.
When receiving any SIP request with a Max-Forwards field value of zero, and if
request shall be propagated to the other side, the MGCF shall reject the
request with a 483 (Too Many Hops) SIP final response, in accordance with IETF
RFC 3261 [20].
## 7.3 Signalling Interworking of a Call from SIP-I based circuit-switched
core network towards the IP Multimedia Subsystem
### 7.3.1 General
If not otherwise stated within this clause the MGCF shall follow the below
listed procedures for interworking outgoing SIP calls:
Sending SIP messages to the succeeding IMS node:
\- When the MGCF receives a SIP-I message from the preceding SIP-I based
circuit-switched core network then the MGCF shall send this message to the
succeeding IMS network unless otherwise specified in the clauses below.
\- The MGCF shall only send SIP methods, SIP headers, SDP body contents and
other bodies which are permitted by the IMS profile as defined in TS 24.229
[12].
\- The MGCF shall construct IMS specific headers and bodies according to the
procedures defined in TS 29.163 [13].
NOTE 1: This implies that if the incoming SIP-I message contained an
encapsulated ISUP message then the ISUP message is removed from the forwarded
SIP message. But the ISUP information may be mapped into a PSTN XML body, if
supported as a network option.
\- Within IMS the initial INVITE request may be routed to a forking proxy. The
MGCF shall be ready to receive responses generated due to a forked request and
behave according to the procedures specified in IETF RFC 3261 [20] and clause
7.3.9 of the present specification.
NOTE 2: The multiple early dialogues are not propagated to the preceding SIP-I
based circuit-switched core network.
NOTE 3: The MGCF does not, itself, perform forking.
Sending SIP messages to the preceding SIP-I based circuit switched core
network:
\- When the MGCF receives a SIP message from the succeeding IMS node then the
MGCF shall send this SIP message to the preceding SIP-I based circuit-switched
core network unless otherwise specified in the clauses below.
\- The MGCF shall only send SIP methods, SIP headers, SDP body contents and
other bodies as permitted by the profile for SIP-I on Nc as defined in TS
29.231 [4].
\- The MGCF shall, if defined by TS 29.163 [13], construct an ISUP message
following TS 29.163 [13] and include this ISUP message into the SIP message in
a MIME body according to IETF RFC 3204 [19]. The Content‑Type header field and
the Content‑Disposition header field shall be set as specified in clause
5.4.1.2 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.19.12.5 [6].
\- When sending an encapsulated ISUP ACM message or ISUP CPG message the MGCF
shall follow the procedures defined within TS 29.163 [13] for the handling of
the ring tone and therefore may request the IM-MGW to send ring tone in the
backwards direction.
### 7.3.2 Exceptions from forwarding received SIP messages
If call clearing is initiated either from the succeeding IMS node or from the
preceding SIP-I based circuit switched core network then the MGCF shall apply
the call clearing procedures as defined within TS 23.231 [3] clause 7.3.1.
When a BYE request is sent to the succeeding IMS node and if a Reason Header
field was not received, then the received ISUP Cause value being received in
the encapsulated ISUP REL message shall be mapped into SIP Reason header
fields as defined by TS 29.163 [13].
When a BYE request, 4xx, 5xx or 6xx final response to an initial INVITE
request is received from the succeeding IMS Node and the SIP message did not
contain a Reason header, then a 4xx, 5xx, or 6xx final response shall be
mapped to an ISUP cause value as specified in TS 29.163 [13] table 18 or BYE
shall be mapped to cause value 16; this cause value shall be included in the
encapsulated ISUP REL messages as specified in TS 29.163 [13].
When a SIP failure response to an initial INVITE request is to be sent to the
preceding SIP-I node, the cause value contained in the encapsulated ISUP REL
message to be sent shall be used to determine the SIP failure response code as
specified in TS 29.163 [13] table 9.
If different SIP methods are used within the SIP-I based circuit switched core
network and within the IMS network for basic call signalling or supplementary
service signalling, then the MGCF shall map the received SIP message into the
appropriate SIP message of the network the message is sent to.
The MGCF shall modify the SDP it forwards to include local address information
from the IM-MGW and to adjust the codec information if the IM-MGW is
configured to transcode.
The MGCF shall not forward the received 100 Trying provisional SIP responses,
and shall generate 100 Trying provisional SIP responses to acknowledge the
receipt of INVITE requests.
If the MGCF defers sending an INVITE request until preconditions are met (see
clause 7.6.3.1), the MGCF shall reply to the INVITE request from the SIP-I
based CS CN with a 183 Session Progress provisional response and shall not
forward the subsequent PRACK and UPDATE requests from the SIP-I based CS CN,
but reply with a final response to the received request. When the MGCF then
receives from the preceding SIP-I based circuit-switched core network an SDP
indication that preconditions are met and local preconditions are met, the
MGCF shall forward to the succeeding IMS node the previously received INVITE
request with appropriate SDP lines indicating that local preconditions are
met. If MGCF then receives a 183 Session Progress provisional response, it
shall either:
\- not forward this provisional response and acknowledge the receipt with a
PRACK request toward the IMS; or
\- if defined by TS 29.163 [13], construct an ISUP message and include this
ISUP message into the 183 Session Progress provisional response in a MIME body
and remove the SDP answer from the 183 Session Progress provisional response
and forward it toward the SIP-I based CS CN.
### 7.3.3 Sending SIP INVITE request
**When the MGCF receives an incoming SIP INVITE request the MGCF shall ignore
the value of** the Continuity Check indicator in the Nature of Connection
Indicators parameter in the included IAM. If the incoming SIP INVITE request
indicates that remote preconditions are not met or when local preconditions
are not met then the MGCF should defer sending the INVITE request until remote
and local preconditions are met.
NOTE: This recommendation follows TS 29.163 [13] to avoid clipping and other
obstacles, when the receiving IMS terminal does not support SIP preconditions
and the SIP UPDATE method.
As an option, instead of following the above procedure, the MGCF may include
the tag \"precondition\" in the SUPPORTED header and encode preconditions in
the SDP offer that the related local preconditions for QoS are not met.
### 7.3.4 Updating Precondition Information
If the MGCF previously indicated to the succeeding IMS node that preconditions
were not met and a provisional response from the succeeding node indicated
support for preconditions, then the MGCF shall send to the succeeding IMS node
appropriate SDP lines indicating that local preconditions are met
\- when the MGCF receives from the preceding SIP-I based circuit-switched core
network an SDP indication that preconditions are met and local preconditions
are met,
\- or when remote preconditions at the preceding SIP-I based circuit-switched
core network were already met and local precondition status of the MGCF
changes to be met.
For each early SIP dialogue for which a provisional response has been received
from the succeeding node indicating support for preconditions the MGCF, using
an UPDATE or a PRACK request, shall send a confirmation that all the required
preconditions have been met. This applies regardless of whether the early SIP
dialogue existed prior to the preconditions being met or is subsequently
created. The MGCF shall not interwork more than one 200 OK response to an
UPDATE request sent in multiple early dialogues, and should select the 200 OK
response for the early dialogue for which the resources at the IM-MGW are
configured (see clause 7.3.9.2) for interworking.
A 580 Precondition Failure response might be received from the succeeding IMS
node as a response either to the INVITE request, to the UPDATE request or to
the PRACK request. All early dialogues are considered terminated upon
reception of the 580 Precondition Failure response to the INVITE request. The
MGCF shall release the call in accordance with TS 29.163 [13], which also
defines the coding of the REL message with Cause Code \'127 Interworking\' to
be sent to the SIP-I based circuit-switched core network. The MGCF shall
encapsulate the REL message into the 500 Server Internal Error response and
send it to the SIP-I based circuit-switched 3GPP core network.
Upon reception of the 580 Precondition Failure response to the UPDATE or to
the PRACK request within early dialogue MGCF shall immediately send a BYE
request to terminate this early dialogue. Only if there is no more early
dialogues, the MGCF shall encapsulate the REL message with Cause Code \'127
Interworking\' into the 500 Server Internal Error response and send it to the
SIP-I based circuit-switched 3GPP core network.
### 7.3.5 Receipt of SIP redirect (3xx) response
When receiving a SIP response with a response code 3xx, the default behaviour
of the MGCF is to release the call, where the MGCF sends to the preceding
SIP-I based circuit-switched core network 480 Temporarily unavailable and
encapsulate an ISUP REL message with a cause code value 127 (Interworking
unspecified).
NOTE 1: The MGCF may also decide for example to redirect the call towards the
URIs in the Contact header field of the response as an operator option, but
such handling is outside of the scope of the present document.
NOTE 2: Above default behaviour and Note 1 is adopted from TS 29.163 [13].
### 7.3.6 SDP Codec Negotiation
When sending an SDP offer/answer to negotiate codecs with the succeeding IMS
network the MGCF shall send codec information in accordance with TS 24.229
[12].
When sending an SDP offer/answer to negotiate codecs with the preceding SIP-I
based circuit-switched core network the MGCF shall follow the procedures
defined for a 3GPP Intermediate Node in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5].
NOTE: Which codecs are negotiable with the IMS network may depend on operator
choices and preferences (local policy).
If the MGCF received an SDP answer without the OoBTC Indicator and multiple
codecs from the IMS, and initiates a second offer toward the IMS in accordance
with the procedures for a 3GPP Intermediate Node in clause 9 of TS 23.153 [5],
the MGCF shall:
\- if it added the SDP offer to a SIP message received from the SIP-I based CS
CN (e.g. a PRACK), remove the SDP answer from the corresponding response
before sending it to the SIP-I based CS CN; and
\- if it created a new SIP message (e.g. UPDATE or re-INVITE) to send the SDP
offer to the IMS, not forward the SIP message with the SDP answer (e.g. a 200
OK) to the SIP-I based CS CN.
If the MGCF receives from the IMS due to forking for one SDP offer multiple
SDP answers in provisional SIP responses of different early dialogues, the
MGCF shall only interwork the first SDP answer and the MGCF shall not include
any SDP answers in any subsequent SIP early responses it decides to forward.
If the MGCF sends an SDP offer within multiple UPDATE requests for different
early dialogues towards the IMS side, it will receive an SDP answer in the
response to each UPDATE request and the MGCF shall not interwork more than one
200 OK response to an UPDATE request send in multiple early dialogues, and
should select the 200 OK response for the early dialogue for which the
resources at the IM-MGW are configured (see clause 7.3.9.2) for interworking.
### 7.3.7 MGW Selection
If the MGCF supports either the optional \"Optimised MGW Selection\" or the
optional \"Deferred MGW Selection\" then the MGCF shall not send a SDP MGW
Identifier towards the succeeding IMS network. The MGCF shall seize an IM-MGW
and shall then include the connection address in the SDP offer of the initial
SIP INVITE request it will send to the succeeding IMS node.
If the MGCF supports the optional \"deferred MGW selection\" procedure and
receives an unspecified connection address in the SDP offer contained in the
SIP INVITE request, it should include an MGW_Identifier for the IM-MGW it
selects in the corresponding answer. The encoding of the MGW_Identifier is
defined in TS 29.231 [4].
The MGCF shall not use the \"MGW bypass\" option.
### 7.3.8 Autonomous Release
For interworking towards the succeeding IMS node the MGCF shall use the
procedure as defined in TS 29.163 [13].
For call clearing towards the preceding SIP-I based circuit switched core
network the MGCF shall use the procedures as defined within TS 23.231 [3]
clause 7.3 for call clearing towards the originating side.
### 7.3.9 Handling of forked SIP Responses
#### 7.3.9.1 SIP Dialogues
The MGCF shall inspect the tag in the \'To\' header field of a non-100
provisional and a 2xx final responses in accordance to SIP procedures
specified in IETF RFC 3261 [20] to identify the SIP dialogue the response
belongs to. If responses belonging to different dialogues are received, the
initial INVITE request has been forked.
#### 7.3.9.2 Reception of non-100 provisional Responses to initial INVITE
Since the MGCF does not know that forking has occurred until a second non-100
provisional response creating a new early dialogue arrives the MGCF shall
request the bearer resources as required by the first received SDP answer.
For each subsequent non-100 provisional response within a new early dialogue
that is received, the MGCF shall apply the following procedures:
\- Depending on the requirements in the SDP answer and the presence of
P-Early-Media header the MGCF may either refrain from reconfiguring the IM-
MGW, or it may use the Configure IMS Resources procedure.
\- The MGCF shall construct an ISUP message in accordance to TS 29.163 [13],
and send it within the SIP message to the SIP-I based circuit-switched 3GPP
core network. The MGCF shall use only one SIP dialogue within the SIP-I based
circuit-switched 3GPP core network, and the MGCF shall thus supply the same
\'To\' header field in all SIP responses relating to a call it sends towards
the SIP-I based circuit-switched 3GPP core network.
\- However, the MGCF may refrain from sending additional subsequent non-100
provisional response to the SIP-I based CS CN if they do not contain any new
information compared to the last previous non-100 provisional response it sent
towards the SIP-I based CS CN.
\- If the MGCF already received an SDP answer in a previous non-100
provisional response within another early dialogue (and thus forwarded the SDP
answer), the MGCF shall not include the SDP answers in any subsequent non-100
provisional response it decides to send towards the SIP-I based CS CN.
\- The MGCF shall send a PRACK request to the IMS to acknowledge the receipt
of the subsequent non-100 provisional response. The MGCF will receive a
response to the PRACK and shall not forward this response to the SIP-I based
CS CN.
\- If multiple codecs were contained in the provisional response, the MGCF
shall include an SDP offer with the codec configured at the IM-MGW within the
PRACK request.
#### 7.3.9.3 Reception of final Responses to initial INVITE
Upon reception of a non-2xx final response to initial INVITE all early
dialogues are considered terminated. The MGCF shall acknowledge it with an ACK
request. In addition the MGCF shall create an encapsulated REL message as
described in TS 29.163 [13] and shall send it within a non-2xx final response
(initial INVITE) to the SIP-I based circuit-switched 3GPP core network.
When a first 2xx final response is received for one of the early dialogues or
when a received 2xx final response to an INVITE creates a new dialogue, the
MGCF shall acknowledge it with the ACK request. If the remote IMS resources
configured at the IM-MGW do not match the remote resources selected for the
confirmed dialogue MGCF shall require updating the allocated resources. In
addition the MGCF shall create an encapsulated ANM or CON message as described
in TS 29.163 [13] and shall send it within a final 200 OK response to the
initial INVITE to the SIP-I based circuit-switched 3GPP core network. If the
previously negotiated codecs in the SIP-I based CS CN differ from the remote
resources selected for the confirmed dialogue, to avoid transcoding the MGCF
should construct a new SDP offer based upon those remote resources and send it
to the SIP-I based CS CN within an UPDATE or re-INVITE request.
Upon the reception of a subsequent final 2xx response for any further dialogue
for an INVITE request due to forking, the MGCF shall:
1) acknowledge the response with the ACK request; and
2) send a BYE request to this dialogue in order to terminate it.
The INVITE transaction is completed 64*T1 seconds after the reception of the
first 2xx response. At this point the MGCF shall terminate all early dialogs
that have not been already transitioned to confirmed or terminated state.
### 7.3.10 Further setting of SIP header values
The MGCF shall act as a B2BUA as defined in IETF RFC 3261 [20]. The MGCF shall
terminate the incoming SIP-I session and the MGCF shall originate an outgoing
SIP session towards the succeeding IMS node. Therefore the MGCF shall generate
the SIP headers and values of Cseq, Call-ID, Via, Record-Route, Route and
Contact independently from the received SIP-I message. For the generation of
the Request-URI of an initial INVITE requests and header fields To, From, Max-
Forwards, and P-Asserted-Identity the MGCF shall use the information received
from the SIP-I based circuit switched core network node and perform the
procedures specified below.
The Request-URI of in-dialogue SIP requests will be populated with information
received within the Contact header of previous responses according to SIP
procedures. When sending a request towards the IMS the MGCF shall generate a
From tag independent of the value received from the SIP-I based circuit
switched core network. Furthermore, when sending a response towards the SIP-I
based circuit switched core network, the MGCF shall generate a To tag
independent of the value received from the IMS.
The procedures for population of the Request-URI and header fields To, From,
Max-Forwards, and P-Asserted-Identity are based on the mapping procedures
specified in TS 29.163 [13].The text in TS 29.163 [13] is to be understood as
follows:
\- Where ISUP called party number is mentioned, this shall be understood as
internal ISUP called party number.
\- Where ISUP calling party number is mentioned, this shall be understood as
internal ISUP calling party number.
\- Where ISUP Generic Number (additional calling party number) is mentioned,
this shall be understood as internal ISUP Generic Number (additional calling
party number).
NOTE: Only the userinfo component of the received SIP URI is used by mapping
procedures according to TS 29.163 [13] while the received host part is ignored
and a new value is generated by the MGCF.
When sending an initial INVITE request towards the IMS network the MGCF shall
perform the following actions to generate the Request-URI and the To header
field:
\- Create an internal ISUP called party number from the received Request URI
according to TS 29.163 [13]. When Number Portability is supported the MGCF
shall follow the procedures specified in clause 7.2.3.1.2A of TS 29.163 [13].
Otherwise the internal ISUP called party number is generated as specified in
clause 7.2.3.1.2.1 of TS 29.163 [13].
\- Generate the new Request-URI and the new To header field from the internal
ISUP called party number according to TS 29.163 [13].\ When Number Portability
is supported the MGCF shall follow the procedures specified in clause
7.2.3.2.2A of TS 29.163 [13]. Otherwise the Request-URI and the To header
field are generated as specified in clause 7.2.3.2.2.1 of TS 29.163 [13].
When sending an initial INVITE request towards the IMS network the MGCF shall
perform the following actions to generate the P-Asserted-Identity and the From
header fields:
\- create an internal ISUP calling party number and an internal Generic Number
(additional calling party number) as specified in clauses 7.2.3.1.2.6 and
7.2.3.1.2.7of TS 29.163 [13]; and
\- generate the new P-Asserted-Identity and the From header from the internal
ISUP calling party number and the internal Generic Number (additional calling
party number) as specified in clause 7.2.3.2.2.3 of TS 29.163 [13].
When sending the initial SIP INVITE request to the IMS network and if the Hop
Counter procedure is supported in the SIP-I based circuit switched core
network (national option), then the MGCF shall either generate the Max-
Forwards value from the received ISUP Hop Counter parameter by applying the
rules in clause 7.2.3.2.2.4 of TS 29.163 [13] and decrementing the resulting
value by one or forward the received Max-Forwards value decremented by one.
Otherwise if the MGCF forwards SIP request, it shall either set the Max-
Forwards header to a default value or forward the received Max-Forwards value
decremented by one.
When receiving any SIP request with a Max-Forwards field value of zero, and if
request shall be propagated to the other side, the MGCF shall reject the
request with a 483 (Too Many Hops) SIP final response, in accordance with IETF
RFC 3261 [20].
## 7.4 DMTF Signalling Interworking applicable for all Calls between an IP
Multimedia CN Subsystem and a SIP-I based circuit-switched core network
The procedures in clause 4.4 are applicable with modifications described in
the present subclause.
Where the external SIP-I network is mentioned in the procedures in clause 4.4,
this shall be understood as IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) Subsystem.
Where an \"IWU\" is mentioned in those procedures, this shall be understood as
MGCF.
The IMS need not include the PCM codec in SDP offers and answers it sends.
However, it is assumed that the RTP Telephony Event will always be included in
SDP offers and answers from the IMS.
If an IWU receives an SDP offer from a preceding 3GPP SIP-I node without the
RTP Telephony Event (only permitted if only default PCM codec offered) then it
shall include the RTP Telephony Event in the subsequent offer to the IMS.
Procedures in clause 4.4 related to receiving SDP offers or answers from the
external network without the RTP Telephony Event do not apply for the
interworking towards the IMS.
## 7.5 User Plane Interworking
### 7.5.1 General
This clause describes user plane issues including interworking of DTMF.
Figure 7.5.1.1 shows the user plane protocol stacks within the IP Multimedia
Subsystem and the 3GPP SIP-I based circuit switched core network.
Figure 7.5.1.1: user plane interworking
If the same speech codec is used on both sides, no speech transcoding is
required.
### 7.5.2 DTMF Interworking
The procedures in clause 4.5.2 are applicable, however where the external
SIP-I network is mentioned in those procedures, this shall be understood as IP
Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) Subsystem. Where an \"IWU\" is mentioned in
those procedures, this shall be understood as MGCF.
## 7.6 Example Call flows
### 7.6.1 General
In this clause call flows are shown as examples to demonstrate the signalling
interworking of the MGCF. Within the message sequence charts some contents of
the messages are shown in order to visualise some of the important
interworking aspects, which were described in previous clauses of this
document. It is to be noted that the intention is neither to show the complete
content of the SIP messages nor to use the exact syntax of SIP and SDP
messages as it is defined in the respective RFCs. It is also not the intention
to show all alternative options that are possible for a certain call flow.
### 7.6.2 Incoming Call flows
The first call flow shows the signalling for a successful basic call
establishment and the later call release. The second call flow depicts a
failed call setup.
#### 7.6.2.1 Successful Call Establishment and Call Release
Figure 7.6.2.1.1 shows the first part of the incoming call signalling until
the called party is alerted and the MGCF is waiting for an answer message.
Before the received SIP INVITE request is forwarded to SIP-I based circuit
switched core network the MGCF removes the PSTN XML body (after content mapped
into SIP-I message), replaces the received codec list by a 3GPP structured
codec list, and encapsulates the ISUP IAM message, which the MGCF mapped from
the received SIP INVITE request.
The incoming side RTP bearer termination is not yet successfully reserved and
configured and therefore local preconditions are not met. Thus the MGCF
initiates precondition signalling when sending the INVITE request to the
succeeding SIP-I based circuit-switched network.
The MGCF and the succeeding node perform codec negotiation according to 3GPP
rules as specified in TS 23.153 [5]. The MGCF answers to the preceding IMS
node with a single selected codec. If possible, the selected codec is the same
as received from the 3GPP node to avoid transcoding at the network border.
With the 183 Progress the MGCF authorizes the preceding node to use early
media. Therefore, it is not necessary to include the P-Early-Media header in
the 180 Ringing response.
Figure 7.6.2.1.1: Incoming Call (message sequence chart),\ Called Party
alerted
Figure 7.6.2.1.2 shows how the call setup is finalised and how the call is
later released from the IMS side.
Figure 7.6.2.1.2: Incoming Call (message sequence chart),\ Continuation of
figure 7.6.2.1.1
#### 7.6.2.2 Autonomous Release at MGCF
In this example, the MGCF is waiting for an answer from the called subscriber,
i.e. the final response to the SIP INVITE request. Figure 7.6.2.2.1 shows the
signalling when the waiting timer expires. The MGCF initiates call clearing
towards the succeeding SIP-I based circuit-switched network by sending an ISUP
REL message included in a SIP BYE request. It also sends a final response for
the SIP INVITE request towards the preceding IMS node indicating the error
that happened.
Figure 7.6.2.2.1: Incoming Call Failure (message sequence chart),\ called
subscriber does not answer
### 7.6.3 Outgoing Call flows
The first two call flows show the signalling for a successful basic call
establishment. The third call flow shows interworking when the call is forked
within the IMS.
#### 7.6.3.1 Outgoing Call, Sending of INVITE is deferred
Figure 7.6.3.1.1 shows an outgoing call where the preconditions are not met
when the MGCF receives the initial SIP INVITE. The MGCF defers sending of
INVITE until preconditions are met. The MGCF selects a codec and sends back
183 Progress. When the MGCF receives the SIP UPDATE request remote
preconditions are met.
When the MGCF sends the SIP INVITE request to the next IMS node, it does not
request the support for preconditions. The selected codec is inserted as the
first one within the list of offered codecs. Shown, as a network option, is
the inclusion of the PSTN XML body, which is mapped from the previously
received ISUP information. The MGCF offers the support for early media which
is confirmed by the IMS node in the 183 progress. In this example, the answer
does not authorise early media because in-band tones or announcements are not
provided.
When a 180 Ringing provisional response is received from the succeeding IMS
the MGCF orders the IM-MGW to start sending the ringing tone before it
propagates the 180 Ringing, which includes the ISUP ACM, to the preceding
SIP-I based circuit-switched core network.
Figure 7.6.3.1.1: Outgoing Call, sending of INVITE is deferred until
preconditions are met
#### 7.6.3.2 Outgoing Call, Sending of INVITE is not deferred
Figure 7.6.3.2.1 shows an outgoing call where the preconditions are not met
when the MGCF receives the initial SIP INVITE. When the MGCF sends the SIP
INVITE request to the next IMS node before preconditions are fulfilled, it
requests the support for preconditions.
Support for preconditions is confirmed from the IMS node. The MGCF receives
more than one codec in the 183 Progress from the external node. Therefore the
MGCF selects one of the received codecs and makes a second SDP offer to the
external node in the SIP PRACK request in order to lock the codec.
When the MGCF receives from the incoming side an UPDATE message indicating
that preconditions are fulfilled, it propagates the UPDATE message towards the
IMS.
When a 180 Ringing provisional response is received from the succeeding IMS
the MGCF orders the IM-MGW to start sending the ringing tone before it
propagates the 180 Ringing, which includes the ISUP ACM, to the preceding
SIP-I based circuit-switched core network.
Figure 7.6.3.2.1: Outgoing Call, sending of INVITE is not deferred until
preconditions are met
#### 7.6.3.3 Interworking with forked SIP INVITE Requests
In this example, the SIP INVITE request is routed within the IMS to a forking
proxy. Therefore the MGCF has to interwork with multiple early dialogues. This
is shown in figures 7.6.3.3.1 and 7.6.3.3.2, where only those message contents
are shown that are needed for the understanding of this call flow.
When receiving the first 183 Session Progress within dialogue A, the handling
is done as in the previous call flow example (figure 7.6.3.2.1). Afterwards
the MGCF receives another 183 Session Progress but within a second dialogue B.
In this example, the received codec list does not include the codec which is
already selected for dialogue A. Therefore the MGCF can not directly send the
selected codec to the succeeding IMS node within the second dialogue B.
When the SIP UPDATE request is received, which indicates that preconditions
are met, the MGCF sends two SIP UPDATE requests to the succeeding IMS node to
signal within both dialogues that preconditions are met.
Figure 7.6.3.3.1: Outgoing Call, multiple early dialogues
Figure 7.6.3.3.2 shows that only the first 180 Ringing received from the IMS
node is interworked with the SIP-I based circuit-switched core network.
Finally, the SIP INVITE request is answered with a 200 OK within dialogue B.
Any subsequent final response within dialogue A is acknowledged (with an ACK
request) and immediately rejected by sending back a SIP BYE request.

figure 7.6.3.3.1)

### 7.8.4 Non-call related procedures
Clause 9.3.4 in TS 29.163 [13] shall apply.
###### ## Annex A (normative): Interconnecting functionalities in SIP-I based
CS domain
# A.1 General
This annex describes a collection of functions that can be performed on
interconnection boundaries between two SIP-I based 3GPP CS networks or between
a SIP-I based CS network and other SIP-I based external network, based on
operator configuration.
In clauses A.2 and A.3 Stage 2 requirements and border control architecture
are described.
# A.2 Stage 2 Requirements
Based on operator preference, border control functions may be applied between
two SIP-I based 3GPP CS domains or between a SIP-I based 3GPP CS domain and
other SIP-I based external network. These functions, provided by the CS-IBCF,
are:
\- Controlling transport plane functions;
\- Supporting functions to allow establishing communication between disparate
address realms\' SIP-I applications;
\- Providing network configuration hiding to restrict the following
information from being passed outside of an operator\'s network: exact number
of MSC servers, capacity and topology of the network, naming and addressing of
the network nodes;
\- Screening SIP signalling information based on source/destination and
operator policy (e.g. remove information that is of local significance to an
operator);
\- Selecting the appropriate signalling interconnections (e.g. domain based
routing). The IP interconnection between core networks may be supported either
by direct connection or by using an intermediate carrier;
\- Supporting network resources allocation taking into consideration the codec
negotiation performed by (G)MSCs across one or multiple interconnects,
remaining transparent to the SDP negotiation.
In case border control concepts are to be applied in a SIP-I based CS network,
the CS-IBCF acts as an entry point for this network, and also acts as an exit
point for this network.
On the media plane the following functions shall be supported by the CS-TrGW:
\- Gate Management:
\- Opening/closing of gates;
\- Remote source address filtering;
\- Remote source port filtering;
\- QoS packet marking (differentiated services);
\- NA(P)T and IP Version Interworking;
\- Bandwidth policing;
\- Hanging termination detection;
\- IP Realm Indication.
Additionally, the following functions may be supported by the CS-TrGW:
\- IP Realm Availability.
# A.3 Border Control architecture
Figure A.3.1 presents a high-level architecture diagram showing how CS-IBCF
and CS-TrGW logical functions fit into the SIP-I based CS domain.
Figure A.3.1: CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW in SIP-I based CS domain
The CS-IBCF, which provides border control functions, shall be transparent to
the call control application of the adjacent 3GPP SIP-I nodes. That is,
outgoing SIP-I messages from a 3GPP MSC-IWU shall assume that it is signalling
to an external network. The CS-IBCF shall not perform SIP-I profile
interworking functions that are defined by the main text of this
specification. The CS-IBCF is a logical function that either is co-located
with IWU in a single physical (G)MSC-S node, or is within a separate physical
node, e.g. when co-locating with IMS-IBCF.
The Nb reference point allows CS-MGWs to communicate with a CS-TrGW in order
to provide border control functions. The CS-TrGW is a logical function that
may reside in the UP-IWU. The CS-TrGW, which provides border control
functions, shall be transparent to adjacent 3GPP MGWs. The CS-TrGW shall not
perform any SIP-I user plane interworking functions that are defined by the
main text of this specification. The CS-TrGW is a logical function that can be
co-located with UP-IWU in a single physical CS-MGW node, but can also be in a
separate physical node, e.g. when co-locating with IMS-TrGW.
If the logical functions are co-located with (G)MSC and CS-MGW then the Mc
profile as defined by TS 29.232 [55] shall provide the required functionality
(described in clause A.8). If CS-IBCF is physically separated then the CS-IBCF
control function is connected to the CS-TrGW via the CS-Ix reference point
(described in clause A.7), which is realised by the Ix profile as defined by
TS 29.238 [29].
# A.4 Void
# A.5 Procedures at the CS-IBCF
## A.5.1 General
Border control functions may be applied between two SIP-I based CS domains
subsystems or between an SIP-I based CS domains and other SIP-I based networks
based on operator preference. The CS-IBCF may act both as an entry point and
as an exit point for a network. If it processes a SIP request received from
other network it functions as an entry point (see clause A.5.3) and it acts as
an exit point whenever it processes a SIP request sent to other network (see
clause A.5.2).
Depending on its rule, the functions of the CS-IBCF include:
\- network configuration hiding (described in clauses A.5.2.4 and A.5.3.4);
\- application level gateway (in clauses A.5.2.5 and A.5.3.5);
\- screening of SIP signalling (in clauses A.5.2.6 and A.5.3.6);
\- charging (in clauses A.5.2.7 and A.5.3.7).
NOTE: The functions performed by the CS-IBCF are configured by the operator,
and they are network specific.
## A.5.2 CS-IBCF as an exit point
### A.5.2.1 Initial requests
Upon receipt of any request, the CS-IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is an INVITE request and the CS-IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control
functionalities, save the Contact, CSeq, From and Record-Route header field
values received in the request such that the CS-IBCF is able to release the
session if needed;
3) if network topology hiding is required, apply the procedures as described
in clause A.5.2.4;
4) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.2.6;
5) select an entry point of the destination network and forward the request to
that entry point;
NOTE: The list of the entry points can be either obtained as specified in IETF
RFC 3263 [30] or provisioned in the CS-IBCF. The entry point can be a CS-IBCF
or an (G)MSC server.
When the CS-IBCF receives an INVITE request, the CS-IBCF may require the
periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the CS-IBCF. If
the CS-IBCF requires the session to be refreshed, the CS-IBCF shall apply the
procedures described in IETF RFC 4028 [31] clause 8.
IETF RFC 3325 [32] provides for the existence and trust of an asserted
identity within a trust domain. A CS-IBCF at the boundary of the trust domain
will need to determine whether to remove the P-Asserted-Identity header
according to IETF RFC 3325 [32] when SIP signalling crosses the boundary of
the trust domain.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to the initial request and network
topology hiding is required, then the CS-IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.2.4.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to the initial request and screening of
SIP signalling is applied, then the CS-IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.2.6.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to the initial INVITE request that
establishes a dialogue, and the CS-IBCF is configured to perform application
level gateway and/or transport plane control functions, the CS-IBCF shall save
the Contact, To and Record-Route header field values received in the response
such that the CS-IBCF is able to release the session if needed.
### A.5.2.2 Subsequent requests
Upon receipt of any request, the CS-IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is a target refresh request and the CS-IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control functions,
save the Contact and CSeq header field values received in the request such
that the CS-IBCF is able to release the session if needed;
3) if the subsequent request is other than a target refresh request (including
requests relating to an existing dialogue where the method is unknown) and the
CS-IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport
plane control functionalities, save the Contact and CSeq header field values
received in the request such that the CS-IBCF is able to release the session
if needed;
4) if network topology hiding is required, apply the procedures as described
in clause A.5.2.4;
5) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.2.6.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and network
topology hiding is required, then the CS-IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.2.4.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and screening
of SIP signalling is required, then the CS-IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.2.6.
### A.5.2.3 CS-IBCF-initiated call release
If the CS-IBCF provides transport plane control functionality and receives an
indication of a transport plane related error the CS-IBCF may:
1) if the CS-IBCF has already sent an initial INVITE request to the
terminating side, apply SIP procedures detailed in IETF RFC 3261 [20] to
terminate any corresponding SIP dialogue(s) or otherwise cancel the INVITE at
the terminating side, making use of CANCEL and/or BYE request(s), based on
information saved for the related dialogue; and
2) if the CS-IBCF has not yet sent out a final response for the initial INVITE
request, send an appropriate failure response for the initial INVITE request
to the originating side; and
3) if the CS-IBCF has already sent out a final response for the initial INVITE
request, generate a BYE request for the originating side based on the
information saved for the related dialogue.
NOTE 1: Transport plane related errors can be indicated from TrGW.
NOTE 2: Since the CS-IBCF does not handle the encapsulated ISUP, the BYE
message(s) generated by the CS-IBCF will not contain any encapsulated ISUP REL
message.
If the CS-IBCF is able to determine an appropriate Q.850 cause value, then
this may be included in a Reason header in the BYE message(s).
### A.5.2.4 THIG functionality in the CS-IBCF
#### A.5.2.4.1 General
The following procedures shall only be applied if network topology hiding is
required by the network. The network requiring network topology hiding is
called the hiding network.
NOTE 1: Requests and responses are handled independently; therefore, no state
information is needed for that purpose within a CS-IBCF.
The CS-IBCF shall apply network topology hiding to all headers which reveal
topology information, such as Via, Route, Record-Route, and Path. Therefore,
the CS-IBCF shall:
\- either act as a B2BUA, i.e. set above headers as defined for a SIP user
agent client by IETF RFC 3261 [20],
\- or as an option follow the procedures defined in clause A.5.2.4.2.
The CS-IBCF shall not screen SIP parameters for which there is a related ISUP
parameter defined within ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
NOTE 2: SIP-I screening is normally done by the MSC, where the encapsulated
ISUP message and the SIP headers are consistently screened.
Upon receiving an incoming initial request for which network topology hiding
has to be applied and which includes a Record-Route header, the CS-IBCF shall
add its own routable SIP URI to the top of the Record-Route header.
#### A.5.2.4.2 Encryption for network topology hiding
Upon receiving a request/response, outgoing from the hiding network the CS-
IBCF shall perform the encryption for network topology hiding purposes, i.e.
the CS-IBCF shall:
1) use the whole header values which were added by one or more specific entity
of the hiding network as input to encryption;
2) not change the order of the headers subject to encryption when performing
encryption;
3) use for one encrypted string all received consecutive header entries
subject to encryption, regardless if they appear in separate consecutive
headers or if they are consecutive entries in a comma separated list in one
header;
4) construct a hostname that is the encrypted string;
5) append a \"tokenized-by\" parameter and set it to the value of the
encrypting network\'s name, after the constructed hostname;
6) form one valid entry for the specific header out of the resulting NAI, e.g.
prepend \"SIP/2.0/UDP\" for Via headers or \"sip:\" for Path, Route and
Record-Route headers;
7) if the CS-IBCF encrypted an entry in the Route header, then it also inserts
its own URI before the topmost encrypted entry; and
8) if the CS-IBCF encrypted an entry in the Via header, then it also inserts
its own URI before the topmost encrypted entry.
NOTE: Even if consecutive entries of the same network in a specific header are
encrypted, they will result in only one encrypted header entry. For example:
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP ibcf1.home1.net;lr,
SIP/2.0/UDP Token( SIP/2.0/UDP msc2.home1.net;lr,
SIP/2.0/UDP msc1.home1.net;lr);
tokenized-by=home1.net,
SIP/2.0/UDP [5555::aaa:bbb:ccc:ddd]
### A.5.2.5 ALG functionality in the CS-IBCF
The CS-IBCF shall only apply the following procedures if application level
gateway functionality is required by the network.
The CS-IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs ALG functionality. The CS-IBCF,
although acting as a UA, does not initiate any registration of its associated
addresses. These are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer arrangements within
the SIP-I based CS domain.
In case the initial INVITE request is received from own network, i.e. the CS-
IBCF acts as an exit point, the CS-IBCF shall generate a new initial INVITE
request and forward it to the entry point of the other network.
The internal function of the CS-IBCF as an ALG is equal to that one defined in
TS 29.162 [37].
### A.5.2.6 Screening of SIP-I signalling
#### A.5.2.6.1 General
This section relates to the screening of the SIP headers and SDP of the SIP-I
signalling for policing purposes. Inspection of ISUP MIME bodies is out of the
scope of this specification.
The CS-IBCF shall act as a B2BUA when it performs screening of SIP signalling
functionality. In this case the B2BUA behaviour of the CS-IBCF shall comply
with the description given in clause A.5.2.5 for the ALG functionality.
NOTE 1: Many headers are intended for end-to-end operation; removal of such
headers will impact the intended end-to-end operation between nodes.
Additionally security mechanisms covering SIP headers are not precluded; any
such removal can prevent validation of all headers covered by the security
mechanism.
NOTE 2: SIP-I screening is normally done by the MSC, where the encapsulated
ISUP message and the SIP headers are consistently screened.
#### A.5.2.6.2 CS-IBCF procedures for SIP headers
If specified by local policy rules, the CS-IBCF may omit or modify any
received SIP headers prior to forwarding SIP messages, with some exceptions.
NOTE 1: If the CS-IBCF modifies SIP information elements (SIP headers, SIP
message bodies) other than as specified by SIP procedures (e.g., IETF RFC 3261
[20]) caution needs to be taken that SIP functionality (e.g., routeing using
Route, Record-Route and Via) is not impacted in a way that could create
interoperability problems with networks that assume that this information is
not modified.
NOTE 2: Where operator requirements can be achieved by configuration hiding,
then these procedures can be used in preference to screening.
#### A.5.2.6.3 CS-IBCF procedures for SIP message bodies
If IP address translation (NA(P)T or IP version interworking) occurs on the
user plane, the CS-IBCF shall modify SDP according to TS 29.162 [37].
### A.5.2.7 Void
## A.5.3 CS-IBCF as an entry point
### A.5.3.1 Initial requests
Upon receipt of any request, the CS-IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, then respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is an INVITE request and the CS-IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control functions,
save the Contact, Cseq, From and Record-Route header field values received in
the request such that the CS-IBCF is able to release the session if needed;
3) if network topology hiding is required, then apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.3.4;
4) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.3.6;
5) If CS-IBCF receives an initial request for a dialogue or standalone
transaction that contains a single Route header pointing to itself, and it is
co-located with an (G)MSC server, or it has a preconfigured (G)MSC server to
be contacted, then forward the request to that (G)MSC server. Otherwise select
an (G)MSC server and forward the request to that (G)MSC server.
When the CS-IBCF receives an INVITE request, the CS-IBCF may require the
periodic refreshment of the session to avoid hung states in the CS-IBCF. If
the CS-IBCF requires the session to be refreshed, the CS-IBCF shall apply the
procedures described in IETF RFC 4028 [31] clause 8.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to an initial request (e.g. 183 or 2xx),
the CS-IBCF shall:
1) if network topology hiding is required, apply the procedures as described
in clause A.5.3.4;
2) if screening of SIP signalling is applied, apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.3.6; and
3) if the response establishes a dialogue, and the CS-IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control functions,
the CS-IBCF shall save the Contact, To and Record-Route header field values
received in the response such that the CS-IBCF is able to release the session
if needed.
### A.5.3.2 Subsequent requests
Upon receipt of any request, the CS-IBCF shall:
1) if the request is an INVITE request, then respond with a 100 (Trying)
provisional response;
2) if the request is a target refresh request and the CS-IBCF is configured to
perform application level gateway and/or transport plane control functions,
save the Contact and Cseq header field values received in the request such
that the CS-IBCF is able to release the session if needed;
3) if the subsequent request is other than a target refresh request (including
requests relating to an existing dialogue where the method is unknown) and the
CS-IBCF is configured to perform application level gateway and/or transport
plane control functions, save the Contact and Cseq header field values
received in the request such that the CS-IBCF is able to release the session
if needed;
4) if network topology hiding is required, then apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.3.4;
5) if screening of SIP signalling is required, apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.3.6.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and network
topology hiding is required, then the CS-IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.3.4.
When the CS-IBCF receives a response to the subsequent request and screening
of SIP signalling is required, then the CS-IBCF shall apply the procedures as
described in clause A.5.3.6.
### A.5.3.3 CS-IBCF-initiated call release
If the CS-IBCF provides transport plane control functionality and receives an
indication of a transport plane related error the CS-IBCF may:
1) if the CS-IBCF has already sent an initial INVITE request to the
terminating side, apply SIP procedures detailed in IETF RFC 3261 [20] to
terminate any corresponding SIP dialogue(s) or otherwise cancel the INVITE at
the terminating side, making use of CANCEL and/or BYE request(s), based on
information saved for the related dialogue; and
2) if the CS-IBCF has not yet sent out a final response for the initial INVITE
request, send an appropriate failure response for the initial INVITE request
to the originating side; and
3) if the CS-IBCF has already sent out a final response for the initial INVITE
request, generate a BYE request for the originating side based on the
information saved for the related dialogue.
NOTE 1: Transport plane related errors can be indicated from e.g. TrGW.
NOTE 2: Since the CS-IBCF does not handle the encapsulated ISUP, the BYE
message(s) generated by the CS-IBCF will not contain any encapsulated ISUP REL
message.
If the CS-IBCF is able to determine an appropriate Q.850 cause value, then
this may be included in a Reason header in the BYE message(s).
### A.5.3.4 THIG functionality in the CS-IBCF
#### A.5.3.4.1 General
The following procedures shall only be applied if network topology hiding is
required by the network. The network requiring network topology hiding is
called the hiding network.
NOTE 1: Requests and responses are handled independently; therefore, no state
information is needed for that purpose within a CS-IBCF.
The CS-IBCF shall apply network topology hiding to all headers which reveal
topology information, such as Via, Route, Record-Route, and Path. Therefore,
the CS-IBCF shall
\- either act as a B2BUA, i.e. set above headers as defined for a SIP user
agent client by IETF RFC 3261 [20],
\- or as an option follow the procedures defined in A.5.3.4.2.
The CS-IBCF shall not screen SIP parameters for which there is a related ISUP
parameter defined within ITU-T Recommendation Q.1912.5 [6].
NOTE 2: SIP-I screening is normally done by the GMSC, where the encapsulated
ISUP message and the SIP headers are consistently screened.
Upon receiving an incoming initial request for which network topology hiding
has to be applied and which includes a Record-Route header, the CS-IBCF shall
add its own routable SIP URI to the top of the Record-Route header.
#### A.5.3.4.2 Decryption for network topology hiding
Upon receiving a request/response, incoming to the hiding network, the CS-IBCF
shall perform the decryption for network topology hiding purposes, i.e. the
CS-IBCF shall:
1) identify hostnames encrypted by the network this CS-IBCF belongs to within
all headers of the incoming message;
2) use those hostnames that carry the identification of the hiding network
within the value of the \"tokenized-by\" parameter as input to decryption;
3) use as encrypted string the hostname which follows the sent-protocol (for
Via Headers, e.g. \"SIP/2.0/UDP\") or the URI scheme (for Route and Record-
Route Headers, e.g. \"sip:\");
4) replace all content of the received header which carries encrypted
information with the entries resulting from decryption.
EXAMPLE: An encrypted entry to a Via header that looks like:
> Via: SIP/2.0/UDP Token(SIP/2.0/UDP msc2.home1.net;lr,
>
> SIP/2.0/UDP msc1.home1.net;lr);tokenized-by=home1.net
will be replaced with the following entries:
> Via: SIP/2.0/UDP msc2.home1.net;lr, SIP/2.0/UDP msc1.home1.net;lr
NOTE: Motivations for these decryption procedures are e.g. to allow the
correct routeing of a response through the hiding network, to enable loop
avoidance within the hiding network, or to allow the entities of the hiding
network to change their entries within e.g. the Record-Route header.
### A.5.3.5 ALG functionality in the CS-IBCF
The CS-IBCF shall only apply the following procedures if application level
gateway functionality is required by the network.
The CS-IBCF acts as a B2BUA when it performs ALG functionality. The CS-IBCF,
although acting as a UA, does not initiate any registration of its associated
addresses. These are assumed to be known by peer-to-peer arrangements within
the SIP-I based CS domain.
When the CS-IBCF receives an initial INVITE request from another SIP network,
the CS-IBCF shall generate a new initial INVITE request and forward it to the
(G)MSC Server.
The internal function of the CS-IBCF as an ALG is equal to that one defined in
TS 29.162 [37].

### A.7.1.2 Signalling flows
#### A.7.1.2.1 Basic Procedures
##### A.7.1.2.1.1 Call Establishment
Figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1 depicts the signalling flow for a call setup from
external network towards 3GPP PLMN. The same signalling flow applies for a
call setup from the 3GPP PLMN towards an external network with the exception
that terminations T1 and T2 are then exchanged.
1\. The CS-IBCF receives an SDP offer in SIP signalling.
2\. The CS-IBCF detects that one of the CS-TrGW functions is required, e.g.
NAPT/NAT
3\. The CS-IBCF sends a H.248 ADD command to create the outgoing termination
and to request resources to execute CS-TrGW function
4\. The CS-TrGW creates the outgoing termination
5\. The CS-TrGW replies to CS-IBCF with a H.248 Add reply command and provides
the local address and port of the outgoing termination
6\. The CS-IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP using the information
coming from CS-TrGW
7\. SDP offer is sent to the network at the outgoing side
8\. SDP answer is received by CS-IBCF
9\. The CS-IBCF sends a H.248 MOD command to configure the outgoing
termination with Address and port information received in the SDP answer
10\. The CS-TrGW configures the outgoing termination
11\. The CS-TrGW replies to CS-IBCF with a H.248 MOD reply command
12\. The CS-IBCF sends a H.248 ADD command to create the incoming termination
and to request resources to execute CS-TrGW function
13\. The CS-TrGW creates the incoming termination
14\. The CS-TrGW replies to the CS-IBCF with a H.248 Add reply command and
provides the local address and port of the incoming termination.
Note: Steps 12 to 14 may also be executed after step 2.
15\. The CS-IBCF replaces the IP address inside the SDP using the information
coming from CS-TrGW
16\. SDP answer is sent to the network at the incoming side
Figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1: CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW interaction at Call establishment
When creating the termination T1, the CS-IBCF may also indicate that the IP
Interface type is \"NboIP\".
When creating the termination T2, the CS-IBCF may also indicate that the IP
Interface type is \"ExtSIPI\".
NOTE: The IP Interface Type allows the CS-TrGW to collect statistics per
interface type associated with the RTP bearer termination as required by TS
32.407 [44]. The provision of these statistics is outside of the scope of this
specification.
##### A.7.1.2.1.2 Call Release
Figure A.7.1.2.1.2.1 depicts the signalling flow for a call release.
1\. The CS-IBCF identifies that the call is to be released. Typically this
will be by the receipt of a SIP BYE request.
2\. The CS-IBCF sends a H.248 SUB command to release the outgoing termination
3\. The CS-TrGW destroys the outgoing termination
4\. The CS-TrGW replies to CS-IBCF with a H.248 Sub reply command
5\. The CS-IBCF sends a H.248 SUB command to release the incoming termination
6\. The CS-TrGW destroys the incoming termination
7\. The CS-TrGW replies to CS-IBCF with a H.248 Sub reply command
Note 1: Steps 5 to 7 may also be executed before steps 2 to 4 or in parallel
with steps 2 to 4.
Note 2: Rather than releasing the two terminations separately, the CS-IBCF may
request the CS-TrGW to release both terminations in a single request.

#### A.7.1.2.2 Specific Use Cases
##### A.7.1.2.2.1 CS-IBCF as Entry Point, Call Establishment with IP Version
Interworking
This case considers the call establishment message flow for the CS-IBCF and
CS-TrGW, when the CS-IBCF is acting as an Entry point and IP version
interworking is required. The example assumes that the external SIP-I network
uses IPv4 addressing and the CS CN uses IPv6 addressing.
With reference to the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1, the following additions
are required, specific to this use case:
3\. The CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to choose an IPv6-based local connection
address for the created outgoing termination.
5\. The local address and port returned to the CS-IBCF are IPv6-based.
6\. Specifically, the IPv6 address and port number received from the CS-TrGW
in the local connection address of the outgoing termination replace the IPv4
address and port number received from the external SIP-I network.
9\. Specifically, the CS-IBCF passes the IPv6 address and port number received
in the SDP answer to the CS-TrGW as the remote connection address on the
outgoing termination.
12\. The CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to choose an IPv4-based local connection
address on the incoming termination. The CS-IBCF uses the IPv4 addresses and
port numbers received in the initial SDP offer as the remote connection
address on the incoming termination.
14\. The local address and port returned to the CS-IBCF are IPv4-based.
15\. Specifically, the IPv4 address and port number received from the CS-TrGW
in the local connection address of the incoming termination replace the IPv6
address and port number received from the CS-CN.
##### A.7.1.2.2.2 Hanging Termination Detection
This clause considers the message flow for the CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW, when IP
hanging termination detection is required. Hanging termination detection
procedure allows the CS-IBCF to detect a hanging context and termination in
the TrGW resulting, for example, from a loss of communication between the CS-
IBCF and the CS-TrGW.
When the CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to reserve terminations, the CS-IBCF
shall also request the CS-TrGW to periodically report termination heartbeat
indications. If the CS-IBCF includes an indication of the periodicity of the
termination heartbeat notifications, the specified period shall be much
greater than the mean call holding time.
The CS-IBCF and the CS-TrGW shall support detection of hanging terminations.
The call is established as described in clause A.7.1.2.1.1. With reference to
the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1, the following additions are required,
specific to this use case:
3\. The CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to send termination heartbeat
notifications for the created termination. It may also include an indication
of the periodicity of the termination heartbeat notifications.
12\. The CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to send termination heartbeat
notifications for the created termination. It may also include an indication
of the periodicity of the termination heartbeat notifications.
Subsequently, the CS-TrGW shall periodically send termination heartbeat
notifications, as shown in figure A.7.1.2.2.2.1, until the call is released.
When the CS-IBCF receives a termination heartbeat notification from the CS-
TrGW via the Termination heartbeat - Indication procedure, the CS-IBCF shall
return a Termination heartbeat -Indication Ack (without an error) if the
context id / termination identity combination exists in the CS-IBCF. If this
combination does not exist, the CS-IBCF shall return an error and shall
correct the mismatch, for example by requesting the CS-TrGW to subtract the
indicated termination and to clear any associated context.
Figure A.7.1.2.2.2.1: CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW interaction for termination
heartbeat notifications
##### A.7.1.2.2.3 Gate Management
This clause considers the message flow for the CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW, when the
CS-IBCF is acting as an Entry point and remote source address filtering is
required for the termination towards the external SIP-I network.
Gate Management shall be a mandatory feature of the CS-TrGW, but an optional
feature of the CS-IBCF.
As a security related option, on request from the CS-IBCF, filtering may be
enabled to check/validate the source address or source address and port number
of incoming packets from the external network. If the CS-IBCF requests address
filtering, it may additionally provide an address specification, which may
identify either a single address or a range of addresses, against which
filtering is to be performed. The absence of such an address specification in
the request implicitly requests filtering against the IP address of the remote
connection address. In addition to address filtering, the CS-IBCF may also
request port filtering. If the CS-IBCF requests port filtering, it may
additionally include either a port or a range of ports, against which
filtering is to be performed. The absence of a port specification in the
request implicitly requests filtering against the port of the remote
connection address.
If the CS-TrGW is configured to apply source IP address and possibly source
port filtering, it shall only pass incoming IP packets from the identified
source, and discard IP packets from other sources.
The call is established as described in clause A.7.1.2.1.1.With reference to
the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1, the following additions are required,
specific to this use case:
12\. If remote source address filtering is required for the created
termination, then the CS-IBCF includes the information element \"Remote source
address filtering\" in the request sent to the CS-TrGW. In addition, it may
also include the information element \"Remote source address mask\".
If remote source port filtering is required for the created termination (in
addition to remote source address filtering), then the CS-IBCF includes the
information element \"Remote source port filtering\" in the request sent to
the CS-TrGW. It may also include one of the information elements \"Remote
source port\" or \"Remote source port range\".
Subsequently, the CS-TrGW applies filtering as requested to the packets
arriving from the external network. Any packet arriving, which does not meet
the filtering requirement, is discarded.
##### A.7.1.2.2.4 QoS Packet Marking
This clause considers the message flow for the CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW, when the
CS-IBCF requires the use of differentiated services (see IETF RFC 2474 [41]).
It is optional for the CS-IBCF to support differentiated service controlled
over the Ix Interface. It shall be mandatory for the CS-TrGW to support
differentiated service controlled over the Ix Interface. A CS-TrGW can also
support DiffServ Code Point marking based on local configuration. The CS-IBCF
may request the CS-TrGW to set diffserv codepoints for outgoing packets on a
termination. The CS-IBCF may either indicate the applicable DSCP value or
configure the TrGW to copy the DSCP value in the corresponding received
packet. When the CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to create a termination and if
differentiated services are required for the created termination, the CS-IBCF
shall include the information elements \"DiffServ Code Point\" and/or
\"DiffServ Tagging Behaviour\" in the request sent to the CS-TrGW.
The call is established as described in clause A.7.1.2.1.1. With reference to
the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1, the following additions are required,
specific to this use case:
3\. If differentiated services are required for the created termination, then
the CS-IBCF includes the information elements \"DiffServ Code Point\" and/or
\"DiffServ Tagging Behaviour\" in the request sent to the CS-TrGW.
12\. If differentiated services are required for the created termination, then
the CS-IBCF includes the information elements \"DiffServ Code Point\" and/or
\"DiffServ Tagging Behaviour\" in the request sent to the CS-TrGW.
Subsequently, for all egress packets, the CS-TrGW shall set the DiffServ Code
Point in the IP header as specified by the CS-IBCF:
\- If the DiffServ Tagging Behaviour information element was received with a
value to indicate that the DiffServ Code Point should be copied, then the Cs-
TrGW shall copy the DiffServ Code Point in the IP header of the egress packet
from the ingress packet.
\- If the DiffServ Tagging Behaviour information element was not received, or
was received with a value to indicate that the DiffServ Code Point should be
set to a specific value, then:
\- If the DiffServ Code Point information element was received, then the CS-
TrGW shall set the DiffServ Code Point in the IP header of the egress packet
to the value received in the DiffServ Code Point information element.
\- If the DiffServ Code Point information element was not received, then the
CS-TrGW may set the DiffServ Code Point in the IP header of the egress packet
to a configured default value.
##### A.7.1.2.2.5 IP Realms
This clause considers the message flow for the CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW, when the
two networks are in different IP realms. IP realms are described in TS 23.205
[9] clause 20.
The CS-IBCF and the CS-TrGW shall support IP realm indication.
The call is established as described in clause A.7.1.2.1.1. With reference to
the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1, the following additions are required,
specific to this use case:
3\. The CS-IBCF may specify the required IP Realm.
4\. The CS-TrGW allocates resources from the appropriate IP realm as specified
by the CS-IBCF in step 3.
12\. The CS-IBCF may specify the required IP Realm.
13\. The CS-TrGW allocates resources from the appropriate IP realm as
specified by the CS-IBCF in step 12.
If there is a change in the IP Realms that are available or if they are
modified in the CS-TrGW then the CS-TrGW shall inform the CS-IBCF via the IP
Realm Availability Procedure (see clause A.7.2.3), if this procedure is
supported by the CS-TrGW. The basic flow is depicted in figure A.7.1.2.2.5.1
Figure A.7.1.2.2.5.1: IP Realm Availability
The monitoring of IP realm availability is optional and if supported by the
CS-TrGW may be requested by the CS-IBCF.
##### A.7.1.2.2.6 Media Inactivity Detection
The CS- TrGW and the CS-IBCF may support the detection of inactive media
flows.
The CS-IBCF may request a CS-TrGW that supports media inactivity detection to
detect if a media flow is inactive.
NOTE: The decision to apply or not to apply media inactivity detection is
general for all sessions with the same media characteristics (i.e. not user
specific). Detailed conditions when media inactivity detection can be
requested are not specified in the present release.
When the CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to reserve transport
addresses/resources, the CS-I BCF may indicate to the CS-TrGW that detection
of an inactive media flow is required and may additional specify inactivity
detection time and inactivity detection direction. The IBCF may request the
detection of media inactivity on a termination or a stream basis.
The call is established as described in clause A.7.1.2.1.1. With reference to
the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1, the following additions are required,
specific to this use case:
3\. The CS-IBCF indicates to the CS-TrGW that detection of an inactive media
flow is required and can additional specify inactivity detection time and
inactivity detection direction.
12\. The CS-IBCF indicates to the CS-TrGW that detection of an inactive media
flow is required and can additional specify inactivity detection time and
inactivity detection direction.
The CS- TrGW shall determine a media flow to be inactive if there is no media
sent and/or received within the inactivity detection time period.
When the CS-IBCF receives a notification of inactive media from the CS-TrGW
via the Media Inactivity Notification procedure, the CS-IBCF shall return a
Media Inactivity Notification Ack and shall take appropriate action (e.g.
release the termination).

##### A.7.1.2.2.7 RTCP Handling
The CS-IBCF and the CS-TrGW shall support control via the Ix interface of the
specific RTCP behaviour associated to an RTP flow.
When the CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to reserve transport addresses/resources
for an RTP flow, the CS-IBCF may indicate to the CS-TrGW whether to reserve
corresponding RTCP resources should also request the CS-TrGW to reserve
resources for the corresponding RTCP flow, but may alternatively request the
CS-TrGW not to reserve resources for the corresponding RTCP flow. When the CS-
IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to reserve transport addresses/resources for a non-
RTP flow, the CS-IBCF shall not request the CS-TrGW to reserve resources for
an RTCP flow.
To request the CS-TrGW to reserve resources for an RTCP flow, the CS-IBCF
shall provide the RTCP handling information element with a value indicating
that resources for RTCP shall be reserved.
To request the CS-TrGW not to reserve resources for an RTCP flow, the CS-IBCF
shall either provide the RTCP handling information element with a value
indicating that resources for RTCP shall not be reserved or omit the RTCP
handling information element.
If the CS-TrGW receives the indication to reserve RTCP resources, the TrGW
shall allocate a local port with even number for an RTP flow also reserve the
consecutive local port with odd number for the associated RTCP flow, and it
shall send and be prepared to receive RTCP.
If the CS-TrGW receives the indication to not reserve RTCP resources, or does
not receive any indication, it shall not allocate an RTCP port when allocating
a port for an RTP flow. The CS-TrGW shall not send any RTCP packets and shall
silently discard any received RTCP packets.
When RTCP resources are requested, the CS-IBCF may also specify:
\- the remote RTCP port, and optionally the remote address, where to send RTCP
packets; if not specified, the CS-TrGW shall send RCTP packets to the port
contiguous to the remote RTP port;
\- bandwidth allocation requirements for RTCP, if the RTCP bandwidth level for
the session is different than the default RTCP bandwidth as specified in RFC
3556 [39].
NOTE: In line with the recommendations of RFC 3605 [40], separate address or
non-contiguous RTCP port numbers will not be allocated by the TrGW.
The CS-TrGW shall return an error if it can not allocate the requested RTCP
resources.
The call is established as described in clause A.7.1.2.1.1. With reference to
the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1, the following additions are required,
specific to this use case:
3\. The CS-IBCF may specify if RTCP handling is required.
4\. The CS-TrGW allocates RTCP resources as specified by the CS-IBCF in step
3.
12\. The CS-IBCF may specify if RTCP handling is required.
13\. The CS-TrGW allocates RTCP as specified by the CS-IBCF in step 12.
##### A.7.1.2.2.8 Bandwidth Policing
###### A.7.1.2.2.8.1 Overview
The CS-IBCF may support traffic policing of incoming media flows.
The CS-TrGW shall support traffic policing of the maximum average bitrate,
defined as sustainable data rate (see IETF RFC 2216 [42]) of incoming media
flows and may support traffic policing of the peak data rate of incoming media
flows.
The CS-IBCF may require the CS-TrGW to police the media flows to ensure that
they conform to the expected data rates.
When the CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to reserve transport
addresses/resources, the CS-IBCF may indicate to the CS-TrGW that policing of
the related media streams is required and provide traffic policing related
parameters as detailed in clause A.7.1.2.2.8.2.
If such policing is requested, the CS-TrGW shall police the corresponding
media streams as detailed in clause A.7.1.2.2.8.2, by measuring the data rate
for the received packets within that media stream. If the permissible data
rate provided by the CS-IBCF is exceeded, the CS-TrGW shall discard packets to
reduce their data rate to the permissible data rate.
###### A.7.1.2.2.8.2 Bandwidth policing procedures
The call is established as described in clause A.7.1.2.1.1. With reference to
the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1, the following additions are required,
specific to this use case:
3\. If traffic policing is required for the created termination, then the CS-
IBCF shall include the information element \"Traffic Policing Required\" in
the request sent to the CS-TrGW. If policing of sustainable data rate is
required, then the CS-IBCF shall include the information elements
\"Sustainable Data Rate\" and \"Maximum Burst Size\" in the request. If
policing of peak data rate is required, then the CS-IBCF shall include the
information element \"Peak Data Rate\" in the request and may additionally
include the information element \"Delay Variation Tolerance\".
12\. If traffic policing is required for the created termination, then the CS-
IBCF shall include the information element \"Traffic Policing Required\" in
the request sent to the CS-TrGW. If policing of sustainable data rate is
required, then the CS-IBCF shall include the information elements
\"Sustainable Data Rate\" and \"Maximum Burst Size\" in the request. If
policing of peak data rate is required, then the CS-IBCF shall include the
information element \"Peak Data Rate\" in the request and may additionally
include the information element \"Delay Variation Tolerance\".
When requested by the CS-IBCF, the CS-TrGW shall police the media stream flow
rates according to one or more of the following media policing(s), in
accordance with IETF RFC 2216 [42].
The following media policing shall be supported at the CS-TRGW:
\- **Sustainable Data Rate (SDR) Policing:** \ To request policing of the
sustainable data rate of a media stream, the CS-IBCF shall request media
policing for that media stream and shall provide the sustainable data rate,
and shall provide a maximum burst size (MBS) indicating the expected maximum
size of packet bursts for that media stream. The CS-TrGW shall then measure
the data rate for the received packets within that media stream as per IETF
RFC 2216 [42] for \"Token Bucket\", where r=SDR and b=MBS. If the permissible
sustainable data rate is exceeded, the CS-TRGW shall discard packets to reduce
the data rate to the permissible sustainable data rate.
NOTE 1: The CS-IBCF can derive the sustainable data rate from bandwidth
parameters if it receives them within an SDP description.
The following media policing may be supported in addition at the CS-TRGW; if
supported, then the following applies:
\- **Peak Data Rate Policing** :\ To request policing of the peak data rate of
a media stream, the CS-IBCF shall request media policing for that media stream
and shall provide the peak data rate, and may provide a Delay Variation
Tolerance indicating the expected maximum delay variation due to jitter for
that media stream. The CS-TRGW shall then measure the data rate for the
received packets within that media stream. If the permissible peak data rate
is exceeded, the CS-TRGW shall discard packets to reduce the data rate to the
permissible peak data rate. If both peak data rate and sustainable data rate
have been provided for the same media stream, the CS-TRGW shall discard
packets to reduce the data rate to the permissible peak data rate and should
discard packets to reduce the data rate to the permissible sustainable data
rate.
NOTE 2: The decision to apply or not traffic policing is general for all
sessions with the same media characteristics (i.e. not user specific). The
conditions which media policings to apply are beyond the scope of the
specification. This can be based on the media characteristics of the session
(e.g. media type).
##### A.7.1.2.2.9 Through-Connection
The Change Through-Connection procedure is mandatory for CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW
to support.
The CS-IBCF sets the Stream mode parameter using the Change Through-Connection
procedure to request the CS-TrGW to both-way or one-way through-connect or
block media streams on a termination.
The CS-IBCF may combine the Change Through-Connection procedure with the
Reserve and Configure TrGW Connection Point, Reserve TrGW Connection Point or
Configure TrGW Connection Point procedure in figure A.7.1.2.1.1.1., or may
apply this procedure separately.
##### A.7.1.2.2.10 Emergency Call
This procedure is identical to that of clause A.7.1.2.1.1apart from the CS-
IBCF requesting the CS-TrGW to treat the call as emergency call with a
preferential handling by including the information element \"Emergency Call
Indicator\" when creating a context within the \"Reserve and Configure TrGW
Connection Point\" or \"Reserve TrGW Connection Point\" procedure.
With reference to the steps in figure A.7.1.2.1.1, the following additions are
required, specific to this use case:
3\. If step 3 is performed before step 13, the CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW to
handle the call as emergency call by including the \"Emergency Call
Indicator\".
13\. If step 13 is performed before step 3, the CS-IBCF requests the CS-TrGW
to handle the call as emergency call by including the \"Emergency Call
Indicator\".
##### A.7.1.2.2.11 Interactive Connectivity Establishment
The CS-IBCF and the CS-TrGW may support ICE functionality as specified in IETF
RFC 5245 [56] and TS 24.229 [12].
Support of full ICE functionality is optional, but if ICE is supported, the
CS-IBCF and the CS-TrGW shall at least support ICE lite as specified in IETF
RFC 5245 [56]_._
The requirements as described in TS 29.162 [37] for IBCF and TrGW, apply to
the CS-IBCF and the CS-TrGW when the ICE procedures are supported.
## A.7.2 Ix Signalling Procedures
### A.7.2.1 Introduction
This clause describes the logical signalling procedures (i.e. message
identifiers are not part of the protocol) between the CS-IBCF and CS-TrGW. The
procedures within this clause are intended to be implemented using the
standard H.248 procedure as defined in ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1 [33] with
appropriate parameter combinations.
### A.7.2.2 Call Related Procedures

# A.8 (G)MSC - CS-MGW Interaction
## A.8.1 General
### A.8.1.1 Network Model
figure A.8.1.1.1 shows the network model. The squared line represents the call
control signalling. The dotted line represents the bearer control signalling
(if applicable) and the user plane. The (G)MSC uses one context with at least
two terminations in the CS-MGW. The termination T1 is used towards the 3GPP
PLMN and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer towards the external
IP network.
Figure A.8.1.1.1: H.248 Context Model
### A.8.1.2 Signalling flows
The signalling flows in A.7.1.2 apply with the following additions:
\- Instead of the procedure Reserve TrGW Connection Point the procedure
Reserve RTP Connection Point as defined by TS 23.205 [9] is used.
\- Instead of the procedure Reserve and Configure TrGW Connection Point the
procedure Reserve and Configure RTP Connection Point as defined by TS 23.205
[9] is used.
\- Instead of the procedure Configure TrGW Connection Point the procedure
Configure RTP Connection Point as defined by TS 23.205 [9] is used.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Additional Interworking Procedures between a
SIP-I based circuit-switched Core Network and the IP Multimedia (IM) Core
Network (CN) Subsystem to Support Special Services
# B.1 General
The present annex describes additional interworking between a SIP-I based
circuit-switched core network and the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN)
Subsystem to interwork special services such as global text telephony. Those
procedures apply in combination with the procedures in clause 7.
The procedures in the present Annex are optional. However, if a special
service covered in this Annex is interworked, the procedures in the
corresponding clause of this Annex shall be applied.
# B.2 Global Text Telephony
Global Text Telephony (GTT) offers real time conversation in text, optionally
combinable with voice. GTT is mainly used for distant conversation with
hearing or speech impaired users.
GTT is supported in IMS via the Real-Time Text protocol over RTP, using IETF
SIP/SDP for the negotiation of the text media and IETF RFC 4103 [47] RTP-text
for transport, with text coded according to ITU‑T Recommendation T.140 [46].
See TS 23.226 [45], TS 26.114 [52], TS 26.235 [50] and TS 26.236 [51].
Within a SIP-I based circuit-switched Core Network the default PCM codec is
used to transport the PTSN inband text telephony format. PCM will also be
negotiated as codec within SIP-I /SDP, without further information allowing
identifying a call using global text telephony. Different specified systems
for text telephony exist as PTSN inband text telephony format and are used in
different regions, e.g. Baudot (in US), EDT, V.21, Bell103, Minitel and V.18.
They are described in the annexes of ITU-T V.18 [48].
The Interworking procedures in Annex I of TS 29.163 [13] shall be applied with
the following clarifications:
\- Where ISUP signalling is mentioned or depicted, the corresponding SIP-I
signalling is applicable.
