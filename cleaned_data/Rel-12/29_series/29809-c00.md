# 1 Scope
The present document investigates possible enhancements of the Diameter base
protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [2] and existing Diameter applications to support
overload control mechanisms in 3GPP core networks.
This work is based on the results of the feasibility study on Core Network
Overload available in 3GPP TR 23.843 [3] and the related work done in the IETF
Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (DiME) working group.
This study will cover:
\- Identification of the set of requirements for an improved overload control
mechanism over Diameter based signaling interfaces used in 3GPP core networks.
\- Identification, evaluation and selection of candidate solutions for
overload control mechanisms, including:
\- Mechanisms to detect overload situations e.g. notification of Diameter end-
point signaling load;
\- Mechanisms to exchange overload control policies between Diameter end-
points;
\- Details on the expected behaviour of 3GPP core network nodes supporting the
defined overload control mechanism (Diameter end-points and Diameter agent);
\- Evaluation of the impacts of the proposed solution(s) on existing Diameter-
based Technical Specifications and Diameter based signalling networks
(internal operator networks, inter-operator network (e.g. IPX).
\- Recommendations on the solutions to select depending of the applicability
context (interfaces, application, network, etc.)
The results of this study will contribute to the work done within the IETF
DiME working group on Diameter overload control, through official liaison
statement from 3GPP or company-driven individual contributions, which
includes:
\- Provide feedback from 3GPP on the requirements for Diameter overload
control mechanisms defined in IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06
[4]);
\- Contribute to the specification of the IETF standard mechanism for overload
control over Diameter.
The results of this study will be used to identify the changes required in the
3GPP specifications to support overload control mechanisms over Diameter-based
3GPP interfaces and applications.

# 4 Introduction
The Diameter base protocol is widely adopted in 3GPP as protocol support of
numerous signalling interfaces in IMS, EPC, PCC and charging architectures
(e.g. S6a/S6d, Gx/Rx, Cx/Sh, Gz (only Diameter based reference point)/Gy,
Rf/Ro).
Overload situations occur when the resources of a Diameter node are
insufficient to process all the incoming requests. During this period of
overload, the performances of the network are seriously degraded and
cumulative effects can even lead to situation of congestion collapse.
As part of the study on Core Network Overload Solutions (3GPP TR 23.843 [3]),
it has been investigated how the Diameter based interfaces were protected
against signaling overload. The conclusion was that the existing overload
control mechanisms in the Diameter base protocol defined in IETF RFC 6733 [2]
were too limited to efficiently prevent and react to signaling overload. These
limitations are even more critical in large scale networks in which multiple
Diameter nodes, from various vendors, are in the signaling path.
Although vendor-specific solutions might be already available in some
networks, a standardization effort is required to cope with a multi-
vendor/operator environment in large scale networks and roaming cases.
The following clauses describe the problem caused by Diameter overload in 3GPP
networks and investigate the possible enhancements of the Diameter based
interfaces to support adequate overload control mechanisms. These enhancements
should have minimal impacts on existing infrastructures and be generic enough
to be suitable for multiple Diameter based interfaces. However, the exact
solution to implement will be decided per Diameter application, depending on
the specific requirements of each interface.
# 5 Impacts of Diameter Overload in 3GPP Networks
## 5.1 Introduction
The following clauses explain the problem of overload over Diameter signalling
networks, identify the limitations of the existing standard mechanisms to
detect, prevent and overcome overload situations, and describe the causes and
impacts of Diameter overload in 3GPP Diameter-based networks.
## 5.2 Diameter Overload
### 5.2.1 Introduction
The following clauses provide an overview of the overload situation in
Diameter and describe the mechanisms described in IETF RFC 6733 [2] to
discover that a Diameter node is overloaded.
### 5.2.2 Diameter Overload Problem
Diameter (IETF RFC 6733 [2]) is protocol that enables the exchange of messages
between Diameter nodes over TCP and SCTP connections. Communicating Diameter
nodes can share a direct connection or be connected through other Diameter
peers (Diameter agents). In normal conditions, any request sent by a Diameter
client will be processed by a Diameter server in a given realm and the
Diameter server will send back to the Diameter client a message indicating the
result of the request (success/failure).
As described in the IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4], overload
situations in a Diameter signaling network occur when the number of incoming
requests exceeds the maximum request throughput supported by the receiving
Diameter node. Reasons for these temporary overload cases are many and various
in an operational network, including: insufficient internal resource capacity
of a Diameter node faced with a sudden burst of requests e.g. after network
failure/restart procedures affecting a large number of users, deficiency of a
Diameter node component leading to a drastic reduction of the overall
performances of the Diameter node, etc.
As a consequence of the overload situation, the answering Diameter node cannot
successfully process the exceeding proportion of requests. These requests can
be either simply dropped or extremely delayed in the processing. At best, the
Diameter node may have enough internal resources to send back to the request
initiator a message indicating that the requests cannot be successfully
processed. Whatever the behavior of the overloaded Diameter nodes, the rate of
successfully processed requests and consequently the overall performances of
the network decrease.
### 5.2.3 Limitations of Existing Mechanisms in Diameter
The base Diameter protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [2]) provides two native mechanisms
to explicitly indicate that a server is overloaded.
The first mechanism is to use of the Protocol Error \"DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY\" in
the answer related to the request. This error is used by the Diameter node to
indicate a specific server being requested might be busy and unable to provide
the requested service. When receiving such an error code, the downstream
Diameter node should attempt to send the message to an alternate peer, if
available. Shedding of messages or redirection of messages if there are other
servers available to take over the load may be implemented in the downstream
Diameter node in this case. However, the Protocol Error \"DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY
does not provide detailed information of the severity of the overload state of
the server. Furthermore, it can be imagined that in the case the server is
already overloaded, it has to respond to each request with this error code,
which may make things even worse. Although the recipient of the Protocol Error
\"DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY\" could send further requests to alternate peers (if
applicable) to offload the overloaded node, there is no existing explicit
indication of when the overloaded node is not overloaded anymore. This results
in implementation specific handling that is not deterministic or optimal.
The base Diameter protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [2]) enables also an overloaded
server to inform a peer of its lack of internal resources for normal request
processing by sending a request for transport layer disconnection (Disconnect-
Peer-Request) with the disconnect cause set to \"BUSY\", as described in
clause 5.4 of the base Diameter protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [2]). This mechanism
is only meaningful when client and server have a direct transport connection.
If an agent is on the path between the client and the server, only this agent
will receive the disconnection request the cause \"BUSY\". There is no way to
propagate this information to the client that has initiated the request: the
client behind the agent will only receive the Protocol Error
\"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER\" (see below). Moreover, the Diameter node
receiving this disconnection reason is not expected to attempt reconnection
\"_unless it has a valid reason to do so (e.g., message to be forwarded)_ \",
as stated in the base Diameter protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [2]), which provide
very few guidance on when to reopen the connection after an overload
situation. It seems to be assumed that the overloaded node should be able to
reopen the connection after the end of the overload situation whereas Diameter
servers in operational networks are usually configured as connection request
responder-only, leading to a deadlock situation.
When a Diameter agent (Relay or Proxy) is on the path between the client and
the server, the diameter client may receive from the agent the Protocol Error
\"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER\" as answer to the pending request if the server
has terminated the connection with the agent due an overloaded state or if the
server does not even respond because the additional requests are dropped.
Besides the case the host is overloaded and cannot respond the request, which
may fall into this error scope, this Protocol Error cause may be received by
the client for other error cases (e.g. failure of the transport connection, no
entry in the peer table of the Diameter agent), and there is no way for the
Diameter client to clearly determine an overload situation using only Protocol
Error \"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER\".
As an alternative mechanism, a Diameter node might assume that a peer is
overloaded when no responses to requests are received from the peer while the
transport connection works well. However, this mechanism is neither reliable
nor accurate and may take long time for the downstream Diameter node to
realize overload might happen at the server.
Besides the limitation indicated above for each, a common limitation with all
the existing mechanisms is that the downstream Diameter node can only react
after overload happens, i.e. after overload is detected. A mechanism for
overload protection is worth investigated.
As a conclusion, the base Diameter protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [2]) provides very
limited mechanisms to detect and overcome overload situations. These
mechanisms are based on specific error handling or transport connection
management at the server side. The default behaviour of the client relies only
on the availability of alternate peers to offload the requests when the
primary server is offloaded. However, these mechanisms are too loosely
standardized to predict a generic behaviour of all the Diameter nodes present
in the same network in case of overload. For a more sophisticated overload
control mechanism, the specification effort is required at the application
level. This effort could further detail the use of existing mechanisms for a
given Diameter application, by clarifying the expected behaviour of clients
and servers in case of overload. Moreover, being at the application level
would allow defining new mechanisms to enhance the existing Diameter overload
control mechanism.
## 5.3 Overload Scenarios in 3GPP Networks
### 5.3.1 Introduction
3GPP TR 23.843 [3] describes a certain number of overload scenarios from which
we retain the main following categories:
\- a traffic flood resulting from the failure of a network element, inducing a
signalling spike;
\- a network element which is under dimensioned for the peak hour and thus
entering overload conditions until it is upgraded;
\- exceptional but predictable events (e.g. Christmas, New year, Mother's day,
promotional offers during a Short period);
\- a catastrophic event locally generating a traffic spike including emergency
traffic handling.
The characteristics of these overload scenarios are different and the overload
control that will be defined by 3GPP should cover these different scenarios
categories.
### 5.3.2 Overload of the HSS
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
The following clauses describe the possible causes and impacts of overload
over Diameter-based interfaces towards the HSS.
#### 5.3.2.2 Causes of Overload
HSS may be overloaded due to registration and mobility management events such
as a massive number of Attach in a short period of time.
This may be triggered, for example, when a large number of UE and M2M devices
try to re-Attach as a result of failure of the access network or a core
network node. This may be also triggered by a massive number of simultaneous
mobile terminated events e.g. large amount of SMS for Happy New Year will
cause an excessive signalling load towards the HSS to retrieve user location
information.
#### 5.3.2.3 Impacts
##### 5.3.2.3.1 Introduction
The following clauses describe the impacts of Diameter overload over HSS
interfaces.
##### 5.3.2.3.2 Overload impacts over S6a
Impacts vary according to the interfaces where overload occurs, hereafter are
described some possible impacts of an overload over the S6a interface, in
particular towards the UE.
As described in the clause 5.2.3, when the HSS is overloaded over S6a, the MME
can receive for a pending request:
  * An Answer with the Result-Code set to\"DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY\";
  * An Answer with the Result-Code set to \"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER\" when interconnected to the HSS via Diameter agent(s);
  * or no response at all when HSS and MME are peers sharing the same connection..
The table A.1 in the Annex A of 3GPP TS 29.272 [6] describes the mapping
between the possible Diameter error codes received by the MME and the
appropriate NAS cause codes to forward to the UE that has initiated an Attach,
Tracking Area Update or Service Request procedures.
In this table, the Result-Code \"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER\" is mapped to the
NAS cause code #15 \"No suitable cells in tracking area\", which forces the UE
to select another RAT and this will contribute to the overload. It would
result in new attempts including those through the MAP protocol when Gr SGSNs
are involved.
The mapping corresponding to the Result-Code \"DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY\" is not
described in the table A. It means that the default expected behaviour of the
MME when receiving such a Result-Code is the one defined in the base Diameter
protocol (IETF RFC 6733 [2]) with the limitations detailed in the clause 5.2.3
above.
Moreover, in the table A.2 in the Annex A 3GPP TS 29.272 [6], which described
the mapping to NAS cause code for other error conditions, it is not described
what should do the MME when no response is received for a pending request.
This implies that the normal behaviour described in the base Diameter protocol
(IETF RFC 6733 [2]) applies i.e. the retransmission of the pending request.
As described above, the overload of the HSS triggers even more requests from
the UE and consequently additional requests towards the HSS that contribute to
worsen the overload state of the HSS. It is therefore critical to avoid as
much as possible such overload scenario.
### 5.3.3 Overload of the PCRF/DRA
#### 5.3.3.1 Introduction
This clause covers the overload of the PCRF and the DRA. The Policy and
Charging Control architecture and stage 2 procedures are described in the 3GPP
TS 23.203 [10]. Related stage 3 specifications are the 3GPP TS 29.212 [11],
3GPP TS 29.213 [12], 3GPP TS 29.214 [13], 3GPP TS 29.215[14] and 3GPP TS
29.219 [19].
#### 5.3.3.2 Overload of the PCRF
##### 5.3.3.2.1 Introduction
The PCRF is a functional entity managing a multitude of interfaces (intra and
inter operator) to different functional entities. Most of the interfaces are
Diameter based (e.g. Gx, Rx), while others aren't (e.g. Ud).
All of the Diameter based interfaces are session stateful. The same PCRF must
be used for the lifetime of a session. In addition, the same PCRF must be used
for sessions established over the different reference points (Gx, S9, Gxa/Gxc,
etc.) for the same UE or UE\'s IP CAN session, depending on the operator
deployment configuration and scenario. For example, in the visited access case
in roaming scenarios, all sessions for a UE have to be associated with the
same V-PCRF/H-PCRF pair. The PCRF associates those sessions with session
information related to the same UE obtained over the different reference
points (e.g. Rx, Sd).
The PCRF serving a UE is selected when the first Diameter session related to
the UE or UE's IP-CAN session is established. It keeps state related to the UE
as long as there is an ongoing IP-CAN session for the UE and cannot be changed
for that duration. However, a new PCRF can be selected when a UE attaches to
the network if the PCRF selection is on a UE basis, or when the UE sets up a
new IP CAN session if the PCRF selection is performed on an IP-CAN session
basis.
A specialized Diameter Routing Agent (DRA) can be deployed to assist in the
PCRF selection, when new PCC related Diameter sessions are being set up (see
clause 5.3.3.3) and more than one PCRF exists in a Diameter realm.
##### 5.3.3.2.2 Causes of Overload
See clause 5.3.1.
##### 5.3.3.2.3 Impacts
When the PCRF is overloaded, it may behave as follows:
\- Reject requests with a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY result code. When the
scenario/configuration allows it (as specified in clause 5.3.3.2.1), a
recipient of such error (e.g. DRA) may try alternate PCRFs, reject the
triggering procedure (e.g. PCEF rejects a resource modification request due to
a CCA with this error), or possibly in certain cases retry the failed request
when it deems the PCRF not busy anymore. As specified in 5.2.3, such
determination is not currently defined in the standards, is implementation
specific and is not deterministic.
\- Drop requests. The request initiator/intermediary typically times out the
outstanding request and depending on the scenario/configuration, may have
options such as retrying the request, rejecting the triggering request or
sending the request to an alternate PCRF if applicable.
\- Drop existing transport connections/not accept incoming connections. The
behaviour of elements interacting with the PCRF in this case will depend on
whether they are peers of the PCRF (i.e. have a direct connection to it) or
are communicating to the PCRF via intermediaries (e.g. a PCEF communicating to
the PCRF via a DRA). In general, this case, like the "dropping of requests",
is not an explicit indication of overload to elements interacting with the
PCRF. The options available to the node trying to communicate with the PCRF
are to reject the triggering procedure, send the request to an alternate PCRF
if applicable, or retry/send the request when the connection to the PCRF is
restored.
In all of the above cases, retrying the request should be only performed if it
doesn't exceed the time budget the retrying node is allowed to use to complete
the interaction with the PCRF, based on operator policies and configuration.
As an example, if a PGW is configured to time out Gx requests after 2 seconds
and has 5 seconds to respond back to a resource modification request from the
SGW over S5, it has room to retry a timed out Gx request once without
exceeding its time budget of 5 seconds. If however the PGW only had 3 seconds
to respond to the SGW, it cannot retry a timed out Gx request without risking
the timeout of the S5 procedure initiated by the SGW.
When a request cannot be routed to an alternate PCRF or retried to the same
PCRF, the request initiator will need to deal with the failure by either
handling it locally if policies/scenario allow it (e.g. Gx CCR-I rejected but
PGW has local operator policies to not reject the corresponding IP-CAN session
establishment), or reject the triggering procedure (e.g. reject the IP-CAN
session establishment). In the latter case, if the triggering procedure is
retried, it could exacerbate the overload condition and/or cause additional
load/overload in the RAN, IMS, etc.
More detailed impacts are specified in Annex X.
For supporting BBAI, following additionally impacts shall be considered:
\- For WLAN scenario, the PCRF shall additionally be able to associate
sessions established over the S9a and Gxb* for the same UE or UE's IP-CAN
session.
\- For H(e)NB PS service, the PCRF shall additionally be able to associate
session established over the S9a with all the Gx sessions which have same
H(e)NB Local IP address.
\- For WLAN scenario and NSWO traffic case, the PCRF shall be able to
associate session established over the S9a, S9, Rx and Sd interfaces for the
same UE or UE's IP-CAN session.
\- For HNB CS service, a new PCRF can be selected when the HNB performs the
registration to the HNB GW and an S15 session is initiated by the HNB GW. The
PCRF shall able to associate the S9a session with the S15 session.
#### 5.3.3.3 Overload of the DRA used for the PCRF selection
##### 5.3.3.3.1 Introduction
The Policy and Charging Control architecture and procedures related to the
Diameter Routeing Agent (DRA) are described in the 3GPP TS 23.203 [10] and
3GPP TS 29.213 [12].
##### 5.3.3.3.2 Causes of Overload
See sub clause 5.3.1.
##### 5.3.3.3.3 Impacts
###### 5.3.3.3.3.1 Introduction
In order to ensure that all Diameter sessions for Gx, S9, Gxa/Gxc, Rx and Sd
(when the unsolicited application reporting applies) for a certain IPâ€‘CAN
session reach the same PCRF when multiple and separately addressable PCRFs
have been deployed in a Diameter realm, an optional logical \"Diameter Routing
Agent (DRA)\" function is enabled. The DRA acts as a proxy agent or a redirect
agent. In addition the DRA stores information about the assigned PCRF for a UE
and IP CAN session. The DRA selects the PCRF at IP CAN session or Gateway
Control session establishment and stores the PCRF address. After IP CAN
session or Gateway Control Session establishment, the DRA ensures that the
same PCRF is contacted for all related Rx, Gxa/Gxc, Gx, S9 and Sd Diameter
Sessions.
It is assumed in the 3GPP TS 23. 203 [10] that there is a single logical DRA
serving a Diameter realm.
As described in Annex A, a DRA can be deployed in three different modes: PA1,
PA2 and redirect agent.
When a DRA node is overloaded, like any other node, it may reject requests
with a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY result code or simply drop messages/connections as
specified in 5.3.3.2.3.
For supporting BBAI, following additionally impacts shall be considered:
\- For WLAN scenario and EPC-routed traffic case, the DRA shall additionally
ensures that the same PCRF is selected for related S9a, Gxb* Diameter sessions
for the same UE or UE's IP-CAN session.
\- For H(e)NB PS service, the DRA shall additionally ensure that the same PCRF
is selected for the related S9a Diameter sessions.
\- For WLAN scenario and NSWO traffic case, the DRA shall ensure that the same
PCRF is selected for the related S9a*, S9, Rx and Sd Diameter Sessions.
\- For HNB CS service, the DRA shall ensure that the same PCRF is selected for
the related S9a and S15Diameter sessions.
###### 5.3.3.3.3.2 Proxy Agent 1 (PA1)
When a DRA running as PA1 is overloaded, its impacts on clients of the PCRF
(e.g. PCEF, BBERF, AF) is similar to a deployment with no DRA when the PCRF is
overloaded. This is because all messages between the clients of the PCRF and
the PCRF go through the DRA.
Additionally, when the DRA is overloaded, the PCRF is impacted as well, as
messages from the PCRF may be rejected or dropped before they reach the
client. There are two categories of messages originated by the PCRF that are
impacted:
\- Answers that are dropped by the DRA will result in timeouts at the client,
without the knowledge of the PCRF. The client will detect that no answer was
received for its request and may retry the request (possibly causing further
overload) or fail the triggering procedure (e.g. resource modification
request). If the request is not eventually successfully retried, this can
cause a session state mismatch between the PCRF and its clients (e.g. Gx CCA
dropped by the DRA). Depending on the application and message contents, this
can have impacts from charging, usage monitoring, to QoS (e.g. no dedicated
bearers are setup for an IMS call, charging information not conveyed to PCEF,
etc.).
\- Requests can be rejected or dropped. They will need to be handled by the
PCRF similarly to how its clients, i.e. retry later or fail the procedure. If
the procedure is failed, this could cause calls to be dropped (e.g. if Gx RAR
is triggered by Rx, the corresponding Rx session may need to be aborted),
charging to not be applied properly, usage monitoring, etc.
###### 5.3.3.3.3.3 Proxy Agent 2 (PA2)
When a DRA running as PA2 is overloaded, its impacts on clients of the PCRF
(e.g. PCEF, BBERF, AF) is different from a DRA running as PA1. The main
difference is that not all messages go through the DRA. Instead, only session
establishment requests as well as termination requests for certain
applications (Gx, Gxx, S9).
Session establishment requests are impacted in the same way as PA1. Session
update requests are not impacted as they go directly to the destination
bypassing the DRA. Session termination requests for certain applications (ones
that modify the binding) are impacted as they are supposed to go through the
DRA. As opposed to the PA1 case if the DRA rejects the termination request
with a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY result-code or drops the request, the client could
try to send it directly to the PCRF. This will ensure that the PCRF cleans up
the corresponding state and related sessions (e.g. if Gx is terminated, Rx
would need to be aborted, etc.). However, the drawback is that the DRA will
end up with a stale binding, as it would think that the session is still
active.
###### 5.3.3.3.3.4 Redirect Agent
When a DRA is running as a redirect agent, its overload impacts are similar to
the PA2 case for requests initiated by clients of the PCRF. The difference
though with PA2 is that the redirect agent is never in the path of messages
between the PCRF and its clients.
### 5.3.4 Overload of the 3GPP AAA Server
#### 5.3.4.1 Introduction
The 3GPP AAA Server is a functional entity in the EPC architecture, which
exposes many different diameter interfaces towards other network nodes, both
internal and external to the operator's domain. Those interfaces include:
\- STa, SWa: towards external access networks (trusted, STa, and untrusted,
SWa)
\- SWm: towards ePDG
\- S6b: towards PDN-GW (it can be internal for home-routed traffic, or
external, for local-breakout traffic)
\- SWx: towards HSS (internal)
Those interfaces follow a stateful mode of operation (session-oriented),
except SWx which is stateless (non-session oriented).
It should be noted that, typically, it is expected to find a number of 3GPP
AAA Servers deployed in an operator's network, which can work in a load-
sharing model; each AAA server in that pool can initially handle any incoming
user, but once a user is handled in a certain AAA, this server is registered
in the HSS, and from that moment, subsequent interactions for that user must
be handled by the originally assigned AAA server. This means that no traffic
balancing can take place for interactions past the initial user assignment to
a server.
#### 5.3.4.2 Causes of Overload
Similar causes of overload to those described in clause 5.3.1 are also
applicable to the 3GPP AAA Server.
In particular, failure and restart of network elements such as the PDN-GW may
impose a big traffic load on some 3GPP AAA Servers over the S6b interface,
given that a diameter session is maintained for each PDN-Connection, and also
considering that the S6b interactions must always be redirected to a
previously assigned AAA server which is already handling the user.
Each 3GPP AAA Server keeps access session information for a given user,
initiated typically via STa/SWa reference points. For this reason, in
comparison with S6b messages, STa/SWa messages are more prone to be load
balanced to a less loaded 3GPP AAA Server since they are used to setup an
initial access session; this is not so feasible over the S6b interface, which
is typically used once the access session is already ongoing.
#### 5.3.4.3 Impacts
Given the big number of diameter interfaces on the 3GPP AAA Server, and their
dependencies, it is particularly important to prevent unavailability of this
network entity as a result of peaks of traffic.
It should be noted that, prior to Release 11, the unavailability of a specific
3GPP AAA Server which had already been assigned to a user, resulted on that
user being unable to get access/service from the network (even if the external
access network decided to allocate a new AAA server), because the HSS kept re-
directing back to the former 3GPP AAA Server all traffic addressed to that
user. This was solved by including a new indication (AAA-Failure-Indication
AVP) from the access network, over STa and SWx, to let the HSS override a
former user/server assignment.
Therefore, as a consequence of the above, when an access network determines
that a certain 3GPP AAA Server is undergoing a certain level of unavailability
due to overload, it should not simply send traffic to a non-overloaded server;
instead, it must take into account that users already handled by that server
should either remain in that server (with the restriction of a potential
temporary service unavailability), or they should be re-allocated to a new
server, by making use of the mechanism defined in Release 11 that allows the
HSS to override previous 3GPP AAA Server allocations.
Additionally, other impacts related to the overload on specific interfaces
include, for instance, the scenario in which a severe overload of the HSS
could imply to stop accepting new incoming users to the system, and therefore
it would have an impact on interfaces towards the external access networks
(i.e., to start rejecting incoming traffic over STa/SWa).
### 5.3.5 Overload of the Offline Charging System (OFCS)
#### 5.3.5.1 Introduction
The Offline Charging System terminates the Rf reference point as defined in
3GPP TS 32.240 [20]. Other 3GPP specifications define additional reference
points that are functionally equivalent to the Rf reference point. These are
the Gz reference point in the Evolved PS domain and the Wf reference point for
WLAN offline charging.
The Offline Charging System (OFCS) may be decomposed into Charging Data
Function (CDF) and the Charging Gateway Function (CGF) in which case, the CDF
provides the Diameter Accounting Application.
As defined in 3GPP TS 32.240 [20], the following network elements are
connected to the OFCS by the Rf reference point: P-GW, MME, S-GW, ePDG, SGSN,
WLAN, S-CSCF, MGCF, BGCF, IBCF, P-CSCF, I-CSCF, MRFC, SIP AS, Service-NE, and
CS-NE.
The Rf interface utilizes the Diameter Accounting Application as defined in
3GPP TS 32.299 [21].
This clause considers different Overload scenarios over Reference Points
associated to 3GPP Diameter Charging Application for Offline Charging (Rf),
and captures existing defined mechanisms intended to prevent them, if any.
#### 5.3.5.2 Causes
##### 5.3.5.2.1 Network Causes
The different Network Overload scenarios depicted in 3GPP TR 23.843 [3]
(scenario 1 to 5 and 8), are also causes for Overload situations over Rf due
to:
\- Huge surge in Mobility Management signalling: Flood of new Rf charging
sessions from new SGW, Rf closing sessions on old SGW, update Rf sessions from
SGW/PGW on "RAT Change/SGW change" from PGW
\- Flood of Attach over E-UTRAN access resulting in flood of default bearer
establishment signalling, requests extended beyond the S-GW/P-GW to OFCS (Rf)
for associated charging sessions establishment.
\- Flood of resources allocations for Mobile Originating services: dedicated
bearers (over E-UTRAN) or PDP ctxs (over GSM/UMTS), application sessions,
extended beyond the S-GW/P-GW/SGSN/GGSN/AF to OFCS (Rf), associated charging
sessions establishment.
\- Flood of signalling for Mobile Terminating services: SMS-MT resulting in
flood of signalling Rf for MME/SMS-SC, and Push-Application with flood of
signalling for resources allocation (bearers..) extended beyond the
S-GW/P-GW/SGSN/GGSN/AF to OFCS(Rf), associated charging sessions
establishment.
\- Flood of ULI update extended beyond the S-GW/P-GW/GGSN to OFCS(Rf)
associated charging sessions update.
3GPP Diameter Charging Interfaces Rf may also experience overload when
specific Network Nodes fail:
\- Failure of SGW/SGSN/MME/IMS Nodes
\- Restoration procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.007 [22]
3GPP Diameter Charging Interfaces Rf may also experience overload when
specific network nodes fail. For instance, SGW, PGW and ePDG have to send
Accounting request (Start/Stop) messages at IP-CAN bearer
activation/termination, as described in 3GPP TS 32.251 [30]. In case of
failure/restart scenarios as described in the TS 3GPP TS 23.007 [22], a large
number of IP-CAN bearers can be impacted and may cause a burst of Accounting
request (Stop) messages (for terminated IP-CAN bearers) and Accounting request
(Start) (for reactivated IP-CAN bearers). The same applies also for TDF
session establishment/termination.
##### 5.3.5.2.2 Multiple Interfaces for the Same Bearer/Session/Service
The different Overload causes described above, have increased effects on
Charging Nodes Overload (CDF) since these Charging Nodes handle multiple
interfaces for the same session for a UE.
\- In IMS, IMS Nodes combined with a set of AS, may each have an Rf sessions
established with a single CDF for a given IMS session.
\- In EPC, SGWs and PGW may each have an Rf session with a single CDF for a
given IP-CAN bearer.
\- For an IMS session over EPC (e.g., VoLTE), the combination of the above IMS
and EPC nodes may each have an Rf session with a single CDF.
As noted above, changes associated with a single session trigger multiple
Diameter interactions with a single CDF. Extending this to a large number of
users in a short period has a multiplicative impact on the CDF.
##### 5.3.5.2.4 Multiple Interfaces for the Same User
A CDF may run offline charging for different services in parallel for the same
UE: Voice, data, SMS..., therefore several Rf interfaces may be active at the
same time for this purpose.
Some Network Nodes failure may lead to several services being affected by the
failure, therefore CDF will face storm of signalling for multiple Rf
interfaces at the same time.
##### 5.3.5.2.5 Tariff SwitchTime
Predictable event such as Tariff Switch Time may also be one cause of burst of
traffic over Rf interface due to mass simultaneous charging change condition
trigger at the time the Tariff switches: this affects all active
bearers/sessions and services per user (i.e multiple Rf), and all the users
with ongoing Rf sessions.
##### 5.3.5.2.6 Overload of the CTF
One aspect of the Overload to be considered is also Network Node/Network
Overload due to interaction with Charging domain.
CDF Failure, after unsuccessful failover mechanism, may cause Network Nodes
Overload due to buffering of Accounting data.
#### 5.3.5.3 Impacts
##### 5.3.5.3.1 Existing Mechanisms used on 3GPP Diameter Charging Interfaces
All these Overload Situations described above causing storm of Traffic over Ro
and Rf are currently mainly handled through failure handling procedures based
on DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY.
###### 5.3.5.3.1.1 Failure Handling
Sending DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY is one standard possibility for the Server to inform
the CTFs that it is overloaded and cannot process any additional request. When
receiving such error, CTF behaviour is specified for rejecting new requests
(e.g new IMS-session, new IP-CAN bearer/ session) and/or closing ongoing
services (e.g. IMS-session, IP-CAN bearer/session) depending on the cases.
1) Online Charging (Ro)
> DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY received by the CTF from the Overloaded server side (i.e.
> OCS) is processed by the CTF as specified in RFC 3588 and RFC 4006, mainly:
\- For event-based and new session-based requests, attempt sending to an
alternate OCF.
\- For requests associated to existing charging sessions, attempt sending to
an alternate OCF when the server indicated FAILOVER_SUPPORTED, otherwise
follows instructions provided by the server in Credit-Control-Failure-Handling
AVP (e.g terminate, continue..).
2) Offline Charging (Rf)
> DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY received by the CTF from the Overloaded server side (i.e
> CDF) is processed by the CTF as specified in RFC 3588, i.e attempt sending
> to an alternate CDF. In case backup to alternate CDF is not possible,
> buffering may be done by the CTF per 3GPP TS 32.299 [21].
>
> In RFC 3588, an Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP ( not used in 3GPP) may be
> used by a Diameter Server in ACA to control the behavior of the client
> associated to this DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, e.g. deliver the service even if
> records cannot be stored.
###### 5.3.5.3.1.2 Tariff SwitchTime
For Online Charging, a mechanism is defined in 3GPP TS 32.299 [21] in order to
avoid mass simultaneous quota refresh request from the CTFs: both usages
(before and after Tariff Switch Time), are maintained by the CTF and reported
at the next CCR opportunity to the OCS.
###### 5.3.5.3.1.3 Limitations
These mechanisms still lack of guidance for the CTFs to throttle the traffic
before the server is Overloaded and cannot process anymore request. Also the
CTF is not able to resume dialog with the server when it recovers from
Overload.
##### 5.3.5.3.2 Impact of Overload of the CTF
When a Network Node becomes Overloaded due to CTF functions, this may impact
all other Interfaces handled by the Node towards the different elements within
the Network. The per-Interface Overload mechanim is therefore expected to take
place: e.g SIP-overload, GTPc-Overload, Diameter Overload, etc.
### 5.3.6 Overload of the Online Charging System (OCS)
> Editor's Note: The initial input is based on a Liaison from 3GPP SA5. Some
> concerns, not directly related to specific charging issues but to overload
> mechanism under analysis, have been raised by several companies, which would
> be solved by future company contributions.
#### 5.3.6.1 Introduction
The Online Charging System terminates the Ro reference point as defined in
3GPP TS 32.240 [20]. Other 3GPP specifications define additional reference
points that are functionally equivalent to the Ro reference point. These are
the Gy reference point in the Evolved PS domain and the Wo reference point for
WLAN offline charging.
As defined in 3GPP TS 32.240 [20], the following network elements are
connected to the OCS by the Ro reference point: P-GW, WLAN, IMS-GWF, MRFC, SIP
AS, and Service-NE.
The Ro interface utilizes the Diameter Credit Control Application as defined
in 3GPP TS 32.299 [21].
This clause considers different Overload scenarios over Reference Points
associated to 3GPP Diameter Credit-Control Application for Online Charging
(Ro), and captures existing defined mechanisms intended to prevent them, if
any.
#### 5.3.6.2 Causes
##### 5.3.6.2.1 Network causes
The different Network Overload scenarios depicted in 3GPP TR 23.843 [3]
(scenario 1 to 5 and 8), are also causes for Overload situations over Ro due
to:
\- Huge surge in Mobility Management signalling: Flood of Ro sub-sessions
signalling on "RAT Change/SGW change" from PGW
\- Flood of Attach over E-UTRAN access resulting in flood of default bearer
establishment signalling, requests extended beyond the P-GW to OCS (Ro) for
associated charging sessions establishment.
\- Flood of resources allocations for Mobile Originating services: dedicated
bearers (over E-UTRAN) or PDP ctxs (over GSM/UMTS), application sessions,
extended beyond the P-GW/GGSN/AF to OCS(Ro), associated charging sessions
establishment.
\- Flood of signalling for Mobile Terminating services: SMS-MT resulting in
flood of signalling over Ro to SMS-SC, and Push-Application with flood of
signalling for resources allocation (bearers..) extended beyond the P-GW/
GGSN/AF to OCS(Ro) associated charging sessions establishment.
\- Flood of ULI update extended beyond the P-GW/GGSN to OCS(Ro) associated
charging sessions update.
NOTE: There is a separate study activity in SA2 for ULI update overload
problem.
3GPP Diameter Credit-Control Interfaces Ro may also experience overload when
specific Network Nodes fail:
\- Failure of SGW/SGSN/MME
\- Restoration procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.007 [22]
\- Failure of IMS Nodes
3GPP Diameter Credit-Control Interfaces Ro may also experience overload when
specific network nodes fail. For instance, PGW and TDF have to send to OCS CCR
initial to OCS when IP-CAN bearer is activated and CCR terminate when IP-CAN
bearer is deactivated, as described in 3GPP TS 32.251 [30]. In case of
failure/restart scenarios as described in the TS 3GPP TS 23.007 [22], a large
number of IP-CAN bearers can be impacted and a burst of CCR terminate messages
(for terminated IP-CAN bearers) and CCR Initial messages (for reactivated IP-
CAN bearers).
##### 5.3.6.2.2 Multiple Interfaces for the Same Bearer/Session/Service
The different Overload causes described above have increased effects on OCS
since these Charging Nodes handle multiple interfaces for the same session for
a UE.
For IMS session over E-UTRAN/GPRS/UMTS, IMS (AS or IMS-GWF) and PGW having Ro
interface towards the OCS: storm of closing/establishment of IMS sessions and
IP CAN bearers/sessions extended to storm of multiple charging Ro sessions
closing/establishment to OCS.
##### 5.3.6.2.3 Multiple Interfaces for the Same User
The OCS (owning UE's account) may run online charging for different services
in parallel for the same UE: Voice, data, SMS..., therefore several Ro
interfaces may be active at the same time for this purpose.
Some Network Nodes failure may lead to several services being affected by the
failure, therefore OCS will face storm of signalling for multiple Ro
interfaces at the same time.
##### 5.3.6.2.4 Tariff SwitchTime
Predictable event such as Tariff Switch Time may also be one cause of burst of
traffic over Ro interface due to mass simultaneous quota refresh with new
Tariff at the time the Tariff switches: this affects all active
bearers/sessions and services per user (i.e. multiple Ro), and all the users
with ongoing Ro sessions.
##### 5.3.6.2.5 OCS Sy Application
In addition to 3GPP Online Diameter Application, the OCS also processes Sy
Application using the same resources (i.e counters) that are used by the
Credit-Control Application for the same user and bearers/sessions, therefore
OCS overload due to excessive Ro traffic would affect the Sy interface.
##### 5.3.6.2.6 Overload of the CTF
One aspect of the Overload to be considered is also Network Node/Network
Overload due to interaction with Charging domain. OCS Failure, after
unsuccessful failover mechanism, may cause a storm of closing IP-CAN
bearers/sessions/IMS sessions/services inducing a Network overload situation
in case this OCS owns a huge number of UEs.
##### 5.3.6.2.7 Simultaneous Online/Offline Sessions
Both online (Ro) and offline (Rf) Charging can be active at the same time for
a CTF, therefore Network Nodes embedding such CTF may experience Overload due
to simultaneous charging sessions, in addition to other process performed by
the Node.
Such Nodes are: PGW, IMS-AS/IMS-GWF, Poc Server, BM-SC...
# 6 Requirements for Diameter Overload Control
## 6.1 Introduction
This clause provides a set of design considerations and key requirements for
Diameter overload control in 3GPP networks. This clause provides also an
analysis of the set of requirements defined in IETF for a standard Diameter
overload mechanisms, with the aim to fill the gap between 3GPP specific and
IETF requirements.
## 6.2 Design Considerations
### 6.2.1 Introduction
Particular design considerations for the 3GPP use of Diameter overload control
are addressed in the following clauses. These considerations will be used to
identify 3GPP specific requirements regarding Diameter overload control.
### 6.2.2 Impacts on Existing Applications used in 3GPP
#### 6.2.2.1 Introduction
The following clauses highlight impacts to consider when designing and
applying a Diameter overload control mechanism in 3GPP networks.
#### 6.2.2.2 Overload and Applications
A key topic is on how to address the traffic overload associated to a given
Diameter application (e.g. Diameter S6a/S6d application) versus traffic for
other applications.
Distinction should be made between:
\- the overload information;
\- the way (algorithm) a node will handle the traffic reduction for a given
application.
\- It may be application agnostic, e.g. a percentage of reduction applies to
the total number of the Diameter messages for this application and messages to
be dropped are selected on a random basis. The same way to process the traffic
applies to other applications with an overloaded traffic;
\- or it may be application aware e.g. a percentage of reduction applies to
the total number of the Diameter messages for this application, and messages
to be dropped are selected according to an application specific priority order
(as discussed in clause 6.4.5). For instance, a MME may act differently
towards its UEs for an overload over S6a than for an overload over SGd for
SMS.
For a client, although an agnostic application behaviour may be applied, it
may be more relevant to have traffic reduction handling dependent on the
application, e.g. in order to:
  * minimize the impacts on the delivered service and so improve the user experience;
  * or achieve a sustainable traffic reduction possibly at the expense of bad user experience for a limited number of users.
There may not be the need to standardize an application specific order of
priority; this may be left to implementations.
When a server is overloaded, its Diameter identity may be given back to the
clients and to the Diameter agents in the path, so that traffic may be reduced
for this server and not for others. There are a number of other scenarios and
potential scopes to which overload control information may apply discussed in
IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4]. Additionally, 3GPP specific
scenarios will need to be studied.
Considering from a Client's perspective, there is a one to one mapping between
Application and server, when a Node serves as a client for multiple
Applications in parallel, which is the case for Network Nodes running Charging
Applications, the server identity could be sufficient to derive the
application (e.g. OCS identity relates to Online Charging Application, i.e.
Ro). However it might be worth considering the Client Node to apply different
behaviour depending on the server (i.e. Application) experiencing overload,
i.e. different whether Charging Interfaces or other Application interfaces
(see clause 6.2.2.4.3).
#### 6.2.2.3 Complexity
Overload handling may become quite complex as it implies a trade-off between
the efficiency to quickly reduce the overload conditions and the accuracy in
the handling of traffic reduction to minimize the impacts on the delivered
service and on the user experience.
Overcomplicating the solution may represent a danger to the consistent
behaviour between the different involved actors and this may create additional
problems.
In their work, IETF DiME is analysing the content of a default overload
algorithm, which shall be supported by Diameter nodes when no other overload
algorithms are available between the Diameter nodes. 3GPP should try to agree
the use of this default algorithm for its own usage for which 3GPP could
indicate IETF DiME some generic points needed for 3GPP applications. However,
specific 3GPP client and application behaviour needs to be investigation so
3GPP\'s own overload specific algorithms can be provided in addition.
#### 6.2.2.4 3GPP Diameter Charging Applications
##### 6.2.2.4.1 3GPP Use of Diameter for Charging
According to 3GPP Charging architecture, as defined in 3GPP TS 32.240 [20],
Rf/Ro are generic Reference Points from the Charging Trigger Function (CTF)
residing in the different Network Elements (IMS, EPC, AS, SMS-SC...) to the
Charging Data Function (CDF)/ Online Charging Function (OCF) respectively.
3GPP Offline Charging application over Rf Reference Point is specified from
basic functionalities of IETF Diameter RFC 3588, re-using Diameter accounting.
3GPP Online Charging application over Ro Reference Point is specified as re-
using IETF Diameter Credit Control application IETF RFC 4006 with appropriate
functionalities.
In addition, when used within a specific domain/subsystem/service (e.g. IMS,
EPC...), the Ro/Rf Reference Points are specified with service-context
specific behaviors and information.
Therefore, from 3GPP Charging Applications perspective (i.e. Ro/Rf), there may
be different levels to be considered for an overload control mechanism to be
defined:
\- At Diameter protocol level
\- At Diameter Application level, i.e. \"Accounting Application\" and
\"Credit-Control Application\"
\- At 3GPP Charging Application level, i.e. Ro/Rf
\- At \"3GPP-service-Context\" level, i.e. PS-Charging, IMS-Charging, SMS-
Charging...
Considering that OCS/CDF Overload situations currently rely on
\"DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY\" mechanism, it can be noted the Client side associated
behaviour is defined:
\- At Diameter Protocol level (IETF RFC 3588), as a protocol error, and used
as such by \"Accounting Application\" and by \"3GPP Offline Charging
Application (Rf)\" level.
\- At Credit-Control Application level (IETF RFC 4006), within failure
procedures, and used as such by 3GPP Online Charging Application level (Ro).
\- At \"3GPP-service-Context\" level, within service-context dedicated failure
procedures for Rf and Ro. As an example PS-Charging, support of failure
situations by the PGW for Ro: CCR-I, Tx expiry, Session Failover enabled =>
sending to alternate OCS.
Based on this, for a new Overload mechanism to be defined, two levels may be
worth considering:
\- 3GPP Charging Application level, i.e. 3GPP adaptation of \"Accounting
Application\" Rf and \"Credit-Control-Application\" Ro
As examples:
\- on Rf: traffic to be throttled on a Node in order to prevent new charging
session ACR(start) and interim ACR(Interim).
\- on Ro: traffic to be throttled in order to prevent new charging session
(CCR-I).
\- \"3GPP-service-Context\" level (i.e. PS, IMS...) for both Ro and Rf, this
one would have a finest granularity and would have the advantage of a finest
per-domain tuning allowing a better user experience.
> As examples:
  * for IMS on Rf: traffic to be throttled on an IMS Node in order to > prevent interim ACR(Interim) for Re-Invite.
  * for PGW on Ro: traffic to be throttled in order to prevent update > existing charging session (CCR-U) for specific APNs.
\- \"3GPP-service-Context\" level (i.e PS, IMS...) for both Ro and Rf, this
one would have a finest granularity and would have the advantage of a finest
per-domain tuning allowing a better user experience.
As examples:
\- for IMS on Rf: traffic to be throttled on an IMS Node in order to prevent
interim ACR(Interim) for Re-Invite.
\- for PGW on Ro: traffic to be throttled in order to prevent update existing
charging session (CCR-U) for specific APNs.
##### 6.2.2.4.2 Server Connected to Multiple Clients
A key point to be considered by the mechanism is that Server for Charging
applications may have multiple Clients in parallel: several Rf instances from
CDF, and several Ro instances from OCS.
A server may be considered as Overloaded as a whole, but this Overload may be
caused by a sub-set of active Charging sessions, resulting in all Charging
sessions to be impacted by this overload.
It may be interesting from the server's perspective for the overload mechanism
to allow targetting the appropriate charging session(s) so the accurate
behaviour can take place on Client Side. This would not be possible to be
addressed with a "3GPP Charging Application" level solution, granularity of
"3GPP-service-Context" would be needed instead, and would allow to select
between e.g. IMS and PS.
As examples:
\- CDF is overloaded: IMS traffic to be throttled whereas PGW can continue
\- OCS is overloaded: MMS traffic to be throttled whereas MMTel-AS(IMS) can
continue
##### 6.2.2.4.3 Client connected Multiple Servers
Another key point to be considered by the mechanism is that a Network Node
acting as a Client may run several Diameter Applications in parallel, in
addition to Charging applications (Offline Rf and Online Ro).
Although, when a Node serves as a client for multiple Applications, each
application is served by a different server, when a server enters in Overload,
it may be interesting for the Node to apply a differentiated overload e.g
throttling depending on whether the server is a CDF or HSS (e.g. for a
S-CSCF).
Granularity of a \"Diameter Applications\" overload mechanism would be needed
for this.
##### 6.2.2.4.4 Intermediate Nodes Consideration
Intermediate Nodes (Diameter Agent) may exist between Client side (i.e. CTF)
and Server side (i.e. CDF or OCS).
These Diameter Agents may act as Diameter Relay or Diameter Redirect: as such
they are transparent to any Charging Application specific overload mechanism.
In addition, they are assumed not to apply any overload mechanism unknown from
the Charging Applications.
When acting as Diameter Proxy, the Diameter Agent, as such, may apply local
policies, however such policies are expected to be transparent to any Charging
Application specific overload mechanism, and also not related to any other
overload mechanism unknown from the Charging Applications.
Except for the specific case of a \"Diameter credit-control proxy\" referred-
to in IETF RFC 4006 which supports Diameter Credit-Control Application
(statement: \"_If Diameter credit-control proxies exist between the credit-
control-client and the credit-control server, they MUST advertise the Diameter
credit-control application support_ \"), and would need to be considered for
Overload mechanism over Ro.
### 6.2.3 Extensibility and Interoperability
#### 6.2.3.1 General
The specifications of Diameter interfaces and applications, as any other
specification defined in 3GPP, are defined per \"Release\". A given release is
characterized by a finite set of functionalities achieved at a given
milestone. Features can be implemented as soon as completion of the release.
After freezing of the release (i.e. no new feature can be added after the
completion of the release), work related to the addition of new features will
be part of on a new release. This work is often started before completion of
the current release but new features will only be implemented after completion
of the new release.
As it is not expected that all the 3GPP nodes in the networks can be upgraded
at the same time to support the latest release, several releases usually
coexist in 3GPP networks. To ensure constant interoperability and continuous
end-to-end network service, there is therefore a major requirement to ensure
backward and onward compatibility between releases in the system, guaranteeing
optimal interoperability between nodes supporting the new features backward
and the nodes not already upgraded in the network. In this context, a specific
effort has been made to apply this compatibility requirement to the design of
Diameter applications in 3GPP.
The notion of release is absent from the base Diameter protocol. Extensibility
of the base Diameter protocol and Diameter applications is defined in the IETF
RFC 6733 [2] and further detailed in the IETF Draft \"Diameter Applications
Design Guidelines\" (IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-app-design-guide-15 [15]).
However, following these guidelines, addition of a new feature to an existing
application may often lead to the creation of a new application. From a 3GPP
point of view, defining a new application is equivalent to define a new
version of an interface protocol and this does not allow interoperability
between nodes. To avoid this issue, 3GPP has defined an alternative mechanism
that allows further extension of exiting applications without requiring the
creation of a new application. This mechanism was initially defined for the
Diameter Cx application in the 3GPP TS 29.229 [16] and is now reused in most
of the 3GPP defined Diameter applications using the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
It relies on the special handling of optional AVPs at the application level
and advertising the support of new functionalities in the Supported-Features
AVP, ensuring interoperability between nodes supporting different features
over the same Diameter application.
This specific interoperability aspect in 3GPP networks is an important
requirement for any new solution when considering the definition of a new
Diameter overload control mechanism. In particular, if it is decided that one
key requirement is to enable the support of load/overload information using
AVPs exchanged between Diameter clients and servers over any existing Diameter
application using the Supported-Features AVP as defined in 3GPP, this would
imply that:
  * New functionalities related to overload control will have to be introduced as a new feature of the existing application;
  * Support of new feature related to overload control will be advertised with the Supported-Features AVP;
  * Any new AVP introduced in the existing 3GPP defined Diameter application to convey load/overload information will have to be optional AVPs with the M-bit cleared.
In the context of Diameter overload control over 3GPP interfaces, this
specific compatibility mechanism would enable end-to-end capabilities exchange
between diameter client and server. However, this mechanism has some
limitations, as for example:
  * Some Diameter applications used in 3GPP do not support the Supported-Features AVP;
  * This mechanism is only specified for dialogue between client and server and the specific use of the Supported-Features AVP by Diameter agents is not described;
  * Support of a feature is defined as a Boolean state (supported/not supported) and does not allow indicating different levels of functionality supported without defining new feature;
  * This mechanism is 3GPP-specific and the use of this mechanism by non-3GPP Diameter nodes is undefined.
Therefore, if the use of the Supported-Features AVP provides some degrees of
flexibility for the extensibility of Diameter applications and end-to-end
exchange of capabilities in 3GPP networks, further investigations are needed
to assess this mechanism against the specific requirements for support of a
generic overload control solution over existing 3GPP Diameter applications. As
a result, additional or alternative solutions may have to be defined.
Whatever the solution selected to ensure backward and onward compatibility in
3GPP networks, the Diameter overload control mechanism will have to be
designed to be extensible without requiring the definition of new application
when introducing future related functionalities. Therefore, the design
consideration for extensibility given in IETF RFC 6733 [2] and 3GPP TS 29.229
[16] should also be considered when defining this new mechanism.
### 6.2.4 Diameter Session Management in 3GPP networks
#### 6.2.4.1 General
In the 3GPP Diameter applications, two main cases exist:
\- Diameters sessions established on a per UE basis for a long duration, which
may last some hours or days. This is the case for PCC and Charging related
Diameter applications or between access entities and 3GPP AAA server for non
3GPP access (see clauses 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 and 5.3.5).
\- Diameter sessions which are implicitly terminated, so with no state
maintained in the server. This is the case for HSS Diameter applications
When handling overload conditions or to prevent overload, a solution could be
to use load balancing to other servers which are not overloaded, but this may
not be so straightforward:
\- a user is configured in one HSS, and if this HSS is overloaded, it is not
possible to transfer the traffic of the user to another HSS;
\- when establishing a new IP CAN bearer/session for a user and related
Diameter sessions to a PCRF, an OCS or a 3GPP AAA server, it may be possible
to select a PCRF, an OCS or 3GPP AAA server, but when a user has established
IP CAN bearer/sessions, they cannot be moved to another server. The network
could terminate IP CAN bearers/sessions and select a new PCRF, OCS or AAA
server when the UE re-establishes them, but this would impact the user's
experience and also cause extra signalling load.
These considerations may not impact the protocol for load and overload but are
more related to behaviour of the Diameter nodes, which would therefore be
application or session dependent. These examples also raise questions to which
extent the node behaviours for overload handling enter into the scope of 3GPP
standardisation or may be better left to implementation.
Note that for 3GPP Charging Applications, Node behaviour related to Diameter
Charging sessions has a minimum solution described (see chapter 5.3.5.3.1).
### 6.2.5 Network Architecture Considerations
#### 6.2.5.1 Introduction
Several scenarios are discussed in IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06
[4]. Additional considerations for 3GPP networks are discussed below.
#### 6.2.5.2 Network Topologies
##### 6.2.5.2.1 Introduction
There are different topologies used in 3GPP networks. Some examples are shown
in the following:
Possible topology 1:
As shown in the Figure 6.2.5-1, in Diameter LTE non-roaming case, both the
clients (e.g. MME or S4-SGSN or PCEF), and the servers (e.g. HSS or PCRF) are
in the home PMN. There may be DA (Diameter Agent) or DRA (Diameter Routing
Agent) deployed to support user identity resolution or session correlation for
the HSS or the PCRF if there are more than one HSS or PCRF serving the same
users. These Diameter Agents may be deployed separately to support load
balancing and overload control for the HSS or the PCRF respectively, and it is
also possible they are collocated in the deployment.
Figure 6.2.5-1: Diameter LTE non-roaming Implementation Architecture
Possible topology 2:
As shown in the figure 6.2.5-2, which is proposed in the GSMA IR88 for LTE
roaming guidelines, there are DEA (Diameter Edge Agent) deployed in each PMN
for load balancing and topology hiding, which are the Diameter flow point of
ingress to the PMN. The DEA may support overload control to protect the HSS
and PCRF. Besides the DEA, it is possible to deploy other Diameter Agents or
Diameter Routing Agents to support load balancing and overload control for the
HSS or the PCRF, as shown in Figure 6.2.5-1 for non-roaming case.
For supporting BBAI, following additionally impacts shall be considered:
\- During the S9a/S9a* session establishment procedure, the BPCF acts as the
client and the (v)PCRF acts as the server as shown in the Figure 6.2.5-3.
\- During the S9a session establishment trigger procedure, the (v)PCRF acts as
the client and BPCF acts as the server as shown in the Figure 6.2.5-4.
\- During the S9a session establishment procedure, DRA only can select the
(v)PCRF which sent the S9a session establishment trigger message.
\- During the S9 session establishment trigger procedure, the hPCRF acts as
the client and vPCRF acts as the server as shown in the Figure 6.2.5-5.
\- If the S9 session establishment procedure is triggered by the hPCRF, the
DRA only can select the hPCRF which sent the S9 session establishment trigger
message.
\- S9/S9a session establishment trigger procedure (i.e. TER/TEA command) does
not maintain the state.
Editor\'s Note: Whether the BPCF supports the Diameter overload control needs
to be confirmed by the BBF.
The interconnection between PMN can be implemented in two modes:
> \- Bilateral mode with direct peer connections between DEAs and no IPX agent
> in between,
>
> \- Transit mode with PMN interconnection by IPX Agents.

Possible topology 3:
In the IMS network, as shown in the figure 6.2.5-6, I/S-CSCFs, Application
Server and HSS are all located in the same domain. There may be SLF or
Diameter Agents deployed for user identity to HSS resolution, which may
support load balancing and overload control at the same time.

##### 6.2.5.2.2 Types of Network Topologies
For this study, the following network topologies are identified:
\- Topology without DAs:
> Diameter clients and servers are directly connected with SCTP/TCP transport
> connections. Clients and servers are meshed.
\- Topology with DAs handling \"no topology hiding\":
> Diameter clients and servers are connected through DAs without topology
> hiding. This topology contains variants, which will be considered the same
> way, unless otherwise stated:
  * There may be one or several DAs in a path between a client and a server;
  * The DAs may be relay agents, proxy or redirect agents;
  * DAs may be in a meshed network;
  * A client may be connected to one or more DAs;
  * A server may be connected to one or more DAs.
\- Topology with DAs handling \"topology hiding\":
> Behind the \"hiding topology\" wording, the following case is identified:
  * The DA is associated with several servers (a server farm) which are equivalent for handling the client requests. Clients do not know the identity of the server that will serve a particular UE. The DA can apply load balancing between the servers.
Editor's Note: Topology hiding requires further investigation.
\- Other DA topology cases:
\- The case where a DA is associated with several servers which are not
equivalent for handling the client requests, and so without a load balancing
possibility, and where the client does not know the identity of the server
that will serve a UE at least for an initial request (c.f. the user identity
to HSS resolution in 3GPP specifications).
\- The case where clients behind a DA do not support the overload control
feature. In this case, the DA handles the overload control feature instead of
the clients (e.g. in a PLMN interconnection).
##### 6.2.5.2.3 Network Topologies with HSS
The HSS supports Diameter interfaces with a variety of network elements:
\- S6a / S6d with MME / SGSN;
\- Cx, with I, S-CSCFs;
\- Sh with ASs;
\- SWx with AAA server;
\- Zh with BSF
\- S6m / S6n with MTC IWF / MTC AAA;
\- SLh with GMLC;
\- S6c with SMS central functions.
HSS topologies are various:
  * one HSS;
  * multiple separated and independent HSSs, which require a user identity to HSS resolution mechanism as the subscription data of a user is stored in only one of the HSSs;
  * a distributed HSS, following the UDC architecture, with one UDR and several front-ends which could be geographically distributed, but allowing access to any user subscription data;
  * several distributed HSSs, which also require a user identity to HSS resolution mechanism, as the subscription data of a user is stored in only one of the distributed HSSs.
Another characteristic is that the Diameter sessions are implicitly terminated
(limited to a request answer exchange).
Load sharing is not applicable between separated and independent HSS, or
between distributed HSS.
Load sharing may be applied with distributed HSSs between the different front-
ends. It may help to solve the overload of a front end when traffic is not
equally balanced between all the front ends. Nevertheless, if the overload is
due to the UDR within the UDC architecture, the fact to choose another front-
end may not solve the overload.
Regarding the user identity to HSS resolution mechanism, 3GPP specifications
describe the possible use of a Redirect or Proxy DAs without excluding other
possibilities. They are here recapitulated, as they will have impacts on how
overload will be handled according to the different solutions:
\- When a redirect server is deployed, a client which has to send a request to
a HSS of which it does not know the identity, will only provide the Diameter
realm and send its request to the Redirect DA, that will return the identity
of the HSS to the client The client then forwards the request with the HSS
identity in the Diameter Host AVP.
\- When a proxy DA is used, the client which does not know the identity of the
HSS, only provides the Diameter realm and sends the request to the proxy DA
which will determine the HSS identity and forward the request to the HSS. The
client is informed of this HSS identity in the answer it gets from this HSS.
In both cases, for further requests related to the same UEs, the client reuses
the HSS identity it has stored.
3GPP specifications do not exclude other implementation dependent resolution
mechanisms, without specifying them. For example, a practical one for MME or
SGSN, consists in local configured tables mapping an IMSI range to a HSS
identity.
##### 6.2.5.2.4 Network Topologies with PCRF
In 3GPP TS 23.203 [10] clause 7.6.2, it is written:
> \"In order to ensure that all Diameter sessions for Gx, S9, Gxa/Gxc, Rx and
> Sd (when the unsolicited application reporting applies) for a certain IPâ€‘CAN
> session reach the same PCRF when multiple and separately addressable PCRFs
> have been deployed in a Diameter realm, an optional logical \"Diameter
> Routing Agent (DRA)\" function is enabled. This resolution mechanism is not
> required in networks that utilise a single PCRF per Diameter realm.\"
The fact of deploying several PCRFs introduces the use of a logical DA
handling resolution mechanism to find the right PCRF where a UE session is
being handled. This mechanism is different to those already explained for the
HSS case and has also consequences on the overload handling.
#### 6.2.5.3 Heterogeneous Networks
In a heterogeneous network, the functional entities may support different
level of functionalities, thus some of them may not support Diameter overload
control, or may not support extra functionalities defined for Diameter
overload control in future releases. A mechanism is needed for the entities to
exchange their capabilities.
When in heterogeneous networks an (overloaded) Diameter Server or Agent does
not support Diameter Overload Control Mechanisms, Clients and other Agents may
use Implicit Overload Indications (see clause 6.3.3) together with a
preconfigured Overload Mitigation Behaviour (see clause 6.4) in order to
protect the non supporting server or agent from becoming (more) overloaded.
When in heterogeneous networks a Diameter Client does not support Diameter
Overload Control Mechanisms, an Agent in the path between client and server
may perform the overload mitigation behaviour on behalf of the client. It must
be ensured that not more than one entity (client, agents) in a path between
client and server perform redundant overload mitigation.
When in heterogeneous networks the Diameter Client (or Agent on behalf of the
Client) and Server support Diameter Overload Control Mechanisms, other Agents
in the path between Client (or Agent on behalf of the Client) and Server are
not required to support Overload Control Mechanisms.
#### 6.2.5.4 Interconnected Networks
Roaming is a key feature of mobile networks. Provided by GSMA, IP exchange
(IPX) provides the required network-to-network interfaces (NNI) for
interconnection of signalling and control plane signalling between mobile
operators. IPX is then used to transport Diameter-based roaming interfaces
between PLMNs e.g. S6a interface or S9 interface.
The roaming interfaces have distinct characteristics than internal interfaces
regarding transport of load/overload information. Mobile operators may prefer
not to communicate over NNI information only destined to internal use. It must
be therefore possible to control, filter or even block load/overload
information at the NNI based on operator policies.
Moreover, when load/overload information is conveyed over roaming interfaces,
the functional entities in the different networks (e.g. home PLMN, IPX,
visited PLMN) may support different level of functionalities and some of them
may not support Diameter overload control, or may not support extra
functionalities defined for Diameter overload control in future releases.
Therefore, the requirements for heterogeneous networks identified in clause
6.2.5.3 apply for roaming interfaces.
### 6.2.6 Network Performances
Even if not the only important metric, performance in terms of maximum
throughput is one of the key criteria for the design and dimensioning of IP-
based signalling/control plane in mobile networks. Overload conditions in a
Diameter-based signalling network would have an impact on the overall network
performances. Preventing and controlling these overload conditions to avoid
impact on the network performances is obviously of prime interest for mobile
operators. However, the overload control mechanism itself should not introduce
too much delay in the processing of the Diameter messages that would downgrade
the traffic throughput and the general network performances. Moreover, this
mechanism should ensure that an optimal traffic throughput is ensured in
overload conditions, without introducing oscillations in the system.
## 6.3 Diameter Overload Prevention and Detection
### 6.3.1 Introduction
The following clauses describe the features that a Diameter overload control
mechanism should provide to prevent and detect overload conditions.
### 6.3.2 Explicit Overload Indication
#### 6.3.2.1 Introduction
This clause describes the type of information that can be exchanged between
Diameter nodes to indicate overload situation.
#### 6.3.2.2 Overload information propagation
An overloaded Diameter node (e.g. HSS), when transferring overload
information, requests a reduction of traffic sent by the downstream Diameter
nodes.
A key question is where this traffic reduction is performed, as it can be done
by intermediate Diameter agents or by the Diameter clients at the source of
the traffic.
For 3GPP applications, an approach is to consider that the overload control
actions should in general be done by the elements that make the most sense for
any given 3GPP applications. The request initiator may have a better knowledge
of the application environment to accurately reduce the traffic, e.g. an MME,
when informed of an overload from a HSS, it may accurately react towards the
UEs and not simply drop messages.
Nevertheless, it does not preclude intermediate nodes to take actions to
reduce traffic when relevant, e.g. when the clients are not supporting the
overload control mechanism, in case of a notification of an extreme congestion
from a Diameter node, or when an intermediate node has sufficient information
to handle an overload situation effectively. As a general principle, Diameter
agents in front of a server have to \"protect\" the server.
When the Diameter path between a client and a server supporting an overload
control mechanism goes through intermediate Diameter agents which do not
support the overload control mechanism, these intermediate nodes should
nevertheless relay the overload information even if they don't process or
understand it. This has security implications that are much more impactful
than existing Diameter end-to-end security concerns as one maliciously
constructed message carrying Diameter overload control information could shut
down an entire Diameter network. As such, sending overload control information
through non-supporting elements shall not be done without adequate protection
of the overload control information.
#### 6.3.2.3 Overload status information to be carried
IETF Draft draft-campbell-dime-overload-data-analysis-00 [17] has
considerations of information to be included based on existing proposed
mechanisms. It is suggested to continue this effort and produce a data model
supporting core overload control information such as overload level/status,
load level, scoping, and algorithm to be applied. Additional extensions to
this base set of information may be needed for specific 3GPP Diameter
applications.
#### 6.3.2.4 Transfer of Load/Overload Information
There are several optional ways to transfer the load/overload information:
  * Dedicated Diameter messages with a new Diameter application;
  * Piggybacking of the load/overload information on existing messages independent of Diameter applications;
  * Piggybacking of the load/overload information on existing Diameter applications messages.
With use of a new Diameter application, some points need to be taken into
account:
  * In the Diameter nodes, e.g. client and server, a correlation between a specific Diameter application which contributes to the load/overload and the new Diameter application for transfer of load/overload information needs to be created, thus the client of the specific Diameter application may be informed of the overload status of the server and start traffic reduction in case overload happens in the server, e.g. prioritize messages to be sent or to be skipped/shedded;
  * The server needs to decide the Diameter nodes to which the load/overload information needs to be informed, e.g. to retrieve the identities of the clients of specific Diameter applications;
  * Since new messages or commands are introduced, the new Diameter application itself may contribute to the overload.
With use of piggybacking of the overload information on existing messages
independent of Diameter applications, e.g. Device-Watchdog-Request/Answer
messages which are only exchanged between two peers, one point needs to be
taken into account:
  * If there are intermediate Diameter Agents being deployed between the client and server for a specific Diameter application, the overload information of the server may not be able to reach the clients, if any of the intermediate Diameter Agents does not support this overload control mechanism and may not be able to forward this information.
With use of piggybacking of the overload information on existing Diameter
applications messages, some points need to be taken into account:
  * The overload information may be per Diameter application;
  * Impacts on existing Diameter applications are expected.
### 6.3.3 Implicit Overload Indication
#### 6.3.3.1 Introduction
IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4] talks about the use of
implicit indications and the inadequacy of this approach for large, diverse
networks.
However, a Diameter client may receive some overload indications as defined in
Diameter base specification IETF RFC 6733 [2] and then it is recommended that
the client uses them to mitigate overload situation. This may happen even if
involved server and client support the new CN Overload mechanism under
definition, but client handling of such indications is even more important
when the new mechanism is not supported by either client or server.
At least the following indications may be considered:
\- DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY protocol error:
> Diameter base specification IETF RFC 6733 [2] does not suggest that the
> receipt of a protocol error DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY response should affect future
> Diameter messages in any way, then it may be relevant for some applications
> to define the behavior that best mitigate the overload situation, taking
> into account application specifics, operator deployments.... For example,
> MME may implement a mitigation procedure based on the rate of received
> DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY protocol error from HSS.
\- Lack of response:
> In case of overload the server may react dropping the requests without any
> Diameter error message being returned, what may imply retransmissions in the
> client side, negatively impacting overload. Therefore, for each application,
> it should be analyzed how to mitigate overload in this situation. For
> example, the client may consider avoiding retransmissions when a number of
> messages have not been answered.
## 6.4 Diameter Node Behavior for Overload Mitigation
### 6.4.1 Introduction
This clause describes the behaviour of the Diameter clients (e.g. MME, PCEF,
etc.), Diameter agents (e.g. DRA, DEA, etc.) and Diameter servers (e.g. HSS,
PCRF, OCF/CDF) in overload situations with use of explicit or implicit
overload indication for overload mitigation.
### 6.4.2 Load-balancing
#### 6.4.2.1 General
In the case there are more than one server which can serve for the same users
and same Diameter application, a logical Diameter Agent may be deployed before
the servers for load balancing. Load balancing allows the distribution of the
traffic towards different servers in order to even out the traffic handling
between them and provide a distributed reliability. The load information
transmitted by servers can be used in order to provide a dynamic load
balancing.
The Diameter Agent can hide the overload situation of a specific server to
other Diameter nodes, including clients, if the requests can be handled by
other servers. In this way, to other Diameter nodes, the Diameter Agent
aggregates the load of all the servers, and if possible may aggregate the
overload severity of all the servers, e.g. if any request from the client can
be handled by any of the servers.
The Diameter Agent may allocate load to different servers based on an
algorithm or configuration, to avoid the case most or all traffic reaching to
one specific server, resulting in overload of the server, while other servers
are kept idle. The assumption is that the Diameter Agent can get the load
status of each server by some means, e.g. by explicit or implicit indication
from the servers. When one or more servers behind a Diameter agent are
overloaded, if the remaining servers are not overloaded, the Diameter agent
may be able to divert traffic to these servers without propagating the
overload information downstream. However, in cases where the servers behind an
agent cannot handle the offered load, the Diameter agent may need to propagate
the overload information downstream.
When applying load balancing, the Diameter Agent needs to take different
Diameter session management in 3GPP networks into account. For a request which
has to be handled by a specific server, e.g. a PCC related request for which a
PCRF has been selected for the UE or UE's IP-CAN session involved in a
previous procedure and some related Diameter sessions have been established on
the PCRF for the UE or UE's IP-CAN session, the Diameter Routing Agent needs
to route the request to the specific server, load balancing cannot be applied.
In case overload of the specific server happens, the subsequent request to the
specific server cannot be re-routed to other servers.
### 6.4.3 Message Retransmission
#### 6.4.3.1 General
Message Retransmission is not a means for overload mitigation.
In the case a Diameter Agent for load balancing and overload control is
deployed, if one of the server behind the Diameter Agent cannot handle a
request due to overload, the Diameter Agent can re-route the current request
to an available server. If all the servers cannot handle a request, an error
or a response with overload indication has to be returned to the client. The
client can retransmit the request to an alternative server if available or
retransmit the request later when the overload situation of the servers is
improved.
In the case there is no intermediate Diameter Agent for load balancing and
overload control deployed before the servers, if the server cannot handle a
request, an error or a response with overload indication can be returned to
the client. The client can retransmit the request to an alternative server if
available or retransmit the request later when the overload situation of the
server is improved.
### 6.4.4 Message Throttling
#### 6.4.4.1 General
Message throttling consists of adapting the rate of messages sent to an
overloaded server by relying on the obtained overload information.
Several considerations should be taken into account when doing message
throttling:
\- On which type of messages the throttling is to be applied with possible
priorities:
\- the various request commands used in a Diameter application have not all
the same importance, so a priority can be introduced when throttling. MAP
allows operators to define priorities among MAP procedures;
\- some Diameter messages may be related to emergency situations or to high
priority users and should not be throttled;
\- above behaviours are Diameter application dependent but it remains
compatible with the objective to have a mechanism for transferring overload
information (AVPs) which can be applied to any Diameter application.
  * Where the throttling is to be applied:
\- applying throttling as close to the source as possible can avoid spreading
the problem inside the network and using resources of intermediate nodes in
the network for signalling that would anyhow be discarded by the overloaded
server node;
\- Intermediate nodes may have a broader view of the network, or more specific
information about servers, than do clients. In these cases, intermediaries may
be the most effective place to apply overload control actions, including
throttling e.g. by dropping, rejecting, delaying messages.
\- when taking into account other behaviour regarding which messages to
throttle, the Diameter client may be well placed to take appropriate actions,
as it may have the knowledge specific to the application that intermediaries
may not have. In these cases, the client may most effectively decide which
messages to throttle and also to react towards sources of the request traffic
e.g. by dropping, rejecting, delaying messages;
\- the client throttling will remain compatible with intermediate DAs which do
throttling according to operator policies, taking into account that the
traffic delivered to the server should be close to the optimal maximum;
\- when clients do not support the overload control feature, throttling may be
applied by an intermediate node supporting the overload control feature.
  * The mechanism how the throttling is done (see following clauses).
#### 6.4.4.2 Throttling by Throttling Factor
When a Diameter server reports overload to clients, the Overload Information
received by the clients may be converted (e.g. based on a negotiated
algorithm) into a throttling factor if not explicitly received. A throttling
factor of e.g. 10% indicates that the clients will not send every tenth
request message on average that would have otherwise been sent to the server.
This means that future traffic will be 10% less than would have been without
throttling. It does not necessarily mean that future traffic will be 10% less
than past traffic. Traffic can still increase although throttling is in place.
Similarly, when a client takes additional actions (e.g. an MME asks the UE not
to retry before a certain delay), it may not be possible for the client to
calculate how much traffic reduction the additional action causes; the client
will simply reject (i.e. not send to the server) every tenth request message
it becomes aware of. This may result in less future traffic than expected.
Overloaded Diameter Servers are expected to adjust the reported Overload
Information when the resulting throttling is too high or too low.
#### 6.4.4.3 Throttling by maximum Rate
When a Diameter server reports overload to clients, the Overload Information
received by the clients may be converted (e.g. based on a negotiated
algorithm) into a maximum rate if not explicitly received. A maximum rate of
e.g. 500 requests per second indicates that the client will reduce future
traffic (i.e. treat as many requests as failed) so that the maximum of 500
requests per second sent to the server is not exceeded.
#### 6.4.4.4 Throttling by window of unanswered messages
When a Diameter server reports overload condition to its clients, it may
indicate a maximum number of unanswered messages (window) that the client must
not exceed. If this window limit is not explicitly received, the client may
calculate it base on Overload Information received from the server.
When the number of unanswered messages reaches the specified limit, the client
should stop sending further request messages to the server; then, as soon as
the server answers some of the pending messages, the client may continue
sending further request messages to the server until the window limit is
reached again.
It should be noted that, in order for the window mechanism to work properly,
those messages that timeout on the client due to being answered very late by
the server, or simply discarded, should count as answered by the window
mechanism on the client (i.e. they should decrease the number of pending
messages to be answered).
The server should be able to indicate to the client that a higher window limit
applies as soon as the overload condition disappears. If the server does not
support window advertisement, the client should use a locally configured
window size.
The server could indicate different window sizes depending on the nature of
the overload condition. For instance, if the server detects peaks of traffic
coming from only one source, it may apply a bigger window size to that client;
on the other hand, if the server gets heavy traffic from many different
sources, it may apply a smaller window size to each individual source of
overload).
This mechanism may be combined with other criteria, such as application-
dependent message priority (see clause 6.4.5). In that case, the client may be
able to exceed the window of pending messages but only for those messages with
very high priority (e.g. MPS or emergency related traffic). Note that those
high-priority messages should still increase the number of unanswered messages
(i.e., normal window handling) when the window limit is not reached, and only
get a special handling once the window has been filled.
In addition, a more advanced handling of priority messages could be to have
separate throttling windows per message category.
### 6.4.5 Message Prioritization
#### 6.4.5.1 General
Message prioritization applies at the overloaded server or Diameter Agent. In
this case, the server/agent needs to decide which requests to process (high
priority requests), and which requests to reject, simply discard, or delay
(low priority requests).
Message prioritization also applies at the client when performing message
throttling.
A first priority case is when a different priority is allocated to the
different procedures of a Diameter application. In MAP (cf. 3GPP TS 29.002 [5]
clause 5.1.2), MAP messages can be ignored according to a priority list of
application contexts which is defined by the operator. Diameter messages could
get different priority depending on the applicable procedure. For example, in
PCC, the same Diameter command could be prioritized or not depending on
whether it corresponds to either the establishment or the termination of a Gx
session.
There are other priority cases to analyze: for example, there is a strong
requirement, for some Diameter applications, that a Diameter node applying
traffic reduction due to Diameter overload control should be able to provide
priority treatment for emergency and high priority users.
Based on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, it shall
be possible to exempt MPS (cf. 3GPP TS 22.153 [18]) from Diameter overload
controls up to the point where further exemption would cause network
instability. Therefore, Diameter messages related to MPS have the highest
priority, and are last to be dropped or rejected, when a Diameter node decides
it is necessary to apply traffic reduction. Diameter overload controls should
not adversely impact MPS.
On the contrary, if messages are related to low priority cases, it is
necessary to drop or reject such low priority messages before the messages
with a normal priority.
Message prioritization should also take into account its effect on sustainable
load reduction; e.g. for the client (MME) not sending S6a CLA or PUR messages
may not really result in a sustainable load reduction in the server (HSS)
since CLR must then be repeated or non receipt of PUR may result in
unnecessary follow up traffic (ISR, CLR) that would not be sent when PUR was
successfully performed.
Apart from that, in an application there may be dependencies among different
messages from a functional point of view, in a way that several messages have
to be received (sometimes even in a specific order) to complete some
procedures.
For example, an IMS registration requires multiple HSS interactions (e.g.
multiple Cx and Sh messages). In case of overload, if any of these messages is
throttled, then the user would not be able to finally register, in fact,
success probability would decrease as the congestion increases. Another
consequence is that the amount of unnecesary signalling is increased.
Therefore, messages throttling should take into account that some messages are
required as a group to achieve a unique result, and for some applications it
may be relevant to attempt to throttle initial messages.
Prioritization can be based on other criteria, for example, messages related
to existent users (e.g. already registered, attached or with a session already
created) could be prioritized, e.g. PCRF would benefit from prioritizing users
with a session, being able to keep the consumer quota for subscribers that are
already using some services. Even, since multiple network elements may work
together (e.g. for user attach or registration), it could be beneficial that
this priority applies (i.e. existent users are prioritized) in all related
applications.
For Diameter applications where there are requirements for differential
handling of messages according to priority, the overload information may need
to indicate:
\- the kind of requests that the server prioritizes (e.g. from now on, send me
only requests for emergency and EMPS users or Update location);
\- an overload metric, leaving the source client to decide which kind of
messages to actually send to the overloaded node.
Indicating the kind of requests that the server would accept to receive in its
current overload status may require the transport of some complex information
(e.g. in this overload status an HSS would accept no Purge, any message for
eMPS user, only 50% of notifications for normal users, no message at all for
normal users,...). An overload metric may allow the support of a simpler
protocol.
It should then be noted that priority cases handling is not part of the
mechanism for transferring the overload information, but is a behavior applied
by a node according to the overload conditions it has received. This requires
the node to be aware if a message has a high priority or not and this is
currently dependent on the Diameter application (e.g. through an AVP
indicating a priority, such as the Priority-Session AVP over Cx) or through
some internal configuration of a node (e.g. the MME knowing that a user
benefits from eMPS).
Message prioritization (per Diameter application) may not need to be
standardized and can be left to implementations.
### 6.4.6 Application Prioritization
#### 6.4.6.1 General
A 3GPP Diameter server (e.g. HSS) may support various Diameter applications
(e.g. S6a/d, Cx, Sh, etc.). Typically a successful S6a/d
authentication/registration for a UE will be followed by more traffic (S6a/d
traffic, Cx traffic, Sh traffic, etc.) for that UE while a dropped S6a/d
authentication/registration will not. Consequently, a successful traffic
reduction on S6a/d may automatically result in less follow up traffic on other
interfaces. It may therefore be worth for the server to prioritize among 3GPP
Diameter Applications when requesting load reduction, e.g. request S6a load
reduction before requesting Sh load reduction.
### 6.4.7 Overload Mitigation Differentiation per Client
#### 6.4.7.1 General
A 3GPP Diameter server (e.g. HSS) or agent when going into overload may detect
that the overload is caused by request flooding from a single client node
(e.g. MME), or a limited set of client nodes, while other client nodes are
sending reasonably few requests only. It may therefore be worth for the
server/agent to differentiate among client nodes when requesting load
reduction, e.g. request more reduction from flooding clients, and less
reduction or no reduction at all from other clients.
Another use case for the server/agent to differentiate among client nodes is
when different client nodes are statically configured in the server/agent with
different priorities and less load reduction or no reduction at all is
requested from high priority clients.
Overload Mitigation Differentiation per Client is especially useful when
throttling by a throttling factor is requested (see clause 6.4.4.2), but
should also be considered when throttling by maximum rate (see clause 6.4.4.3)
is requested. Otherwise normal/low load generating clients will unfairly
suffer from the high load generated by other clients: They need to process the
received overload information even when this will not result in load reduction
(e.g. because the sending rate is already lower than the maximum rate).
It may be up to server/agent implementations to decide when and whether
overload mitigation differentiation per client is used.
### 6.4.8 Overload Information Aggregation
#### 6.4.8.1 General
In the case when there are more than one server which can serve the same users
and same Diameter application, a Diameter Agent may be deployed before the
servers to perform server selection for realm-routed requests (i.e. requests
that do not contain a destination host). Diameter Agents performing server
selection for realm-routed requests may aggregate overload information
previously received from the servers and send the aggregated overload
information (e.g. an everage percentage reduction value) towards the clients,
to request throttling of realm-routed requests.
## 6.5 3GPP-IETF Requirements Gap Analysis
### 6.5.1 Introduction
This aim of this clause is to compare the set of requirements being defined in
IETF for a generic mechanism for Diameter overload control to the specific
requirements for deployment in 3GPP Diameter-based environment.
The IETF Draft on the requirements for overload control over Diameter has been
updated several times and has been published as IETF RFC 7068 [xx]. However,
as the analysis has been done based on the version 6 of the IETF draft (IETF
Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4]), the reference to the draft is
kept and the version number has not been updated in order to understand the
analysis provided in the following clauses.
### 6.5.2 General 3GPP requirements
#### 6.5.2.1 General
Requirements for Diameter overload in the context of the 3GPP applications
using Diameter based interfaces refer to the requirements that are described
in IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4].
The mechanism shall allow distinguishing between:
  * Load information which allows upstream Diameter nodes to instigate actions to prevent overload such as load balancing. This should allow a more dynamic load balancing than relying on pre-configured weights, especially when a node restarts (and is thus not loaded at all);
  * Overload information which, when transferred, allows upstream Diameter nodes to take overload control actions.
3GPP has the following requirements for the mechanism to convey the
load/overload information between nodes:
\- Be the same whatever the Diameter applications;
\- Not to require a redefinition of existing Diameter applications (protocol),
even though the application SW will have to be modified;
\- Involve Diameter end points and agents where relevant;
\- Support different overload report types identifying the traffic that is
subject to throttling, e.g. Diameter request messages identified by
application and destination-host, or Diameter request messages identified by
application and destination-realm which do not contain a destination-host;
\- Negotiate an overload control algorithm with a default;
\- Allow some control on which load/overload information may be sent outside a
PLMN;
\- To allow exchange of load /overload information between nodes that are
connected by intermediaries that do not support the mechanism;
\- To allow extensibility.
### 6.5.3 Review of IETF Requirements
#### 6.5.3.1 General
The IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4] provides a set of
normative requirements for an improved overload control mechanism over
Diameter. The aim of this clause is to review this set of requirements from a
3GPP point of view, considering that 3GPP will be a major consumer of this
foreseen overload mechanism.
The list of requirements is ordered as currently defined in the IETF Draft
draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4]. And for each requirement, a status (Y/N)
is given to indicate whether the requirement is relevant from a 3GPP point of
view. When required, further clarifications are provided in the \"Comments\"
column.

### 6.5.4 Conclusions
The comments raised by 3GPP on the set of requirements identified in the IETF
Draft draft-ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4] have been presented and discussed
in IETF and most of them have been agreed. As a result, the IETF draft has
been updated several times and a common agreement on its content was reached.
The agreed set of requirements has been published in the informational IETF
RFC 7068 [29] in September 2013.
# 7 Solutions for Diameter overload control
## 7.1 Introduction
This clause presents and compares the different solutions proposed to fulfill
the requirements for Diameter overload control defined in IETF Draft draft-
ietf-dime-overload-reqs-06 [4]. The evaluation will take also the requirements
specific to the 3GPP networks. As an output of this analysis, a solution
should be selected as preferred solution for implementation of a Diameter
overload control mechanism in 3GPP networks.
## 7.2 Solution 1: MDOC
### 7.2.1 Solution overview
\"The Mechanism for Diameter Overload Control\" (MDOC) (IETF Draft draft-
roach-dime-overload-ctrl-03 [23]) defines a mechanism for communicating the
load and overload information among Diameter nodes on a hop-by-hop basis.
Because this mechanism is meant to be used on a hop-by-hop basis, load and
overload information is exchanged only between adjacent nodes. This means that
any Diameter agent that forwards a Diameter message must remove any
load/overload information received from the previous hop, act upon it as
necessary/possible and aggregate their own load/overload information to the
existing one in the message before forwarding to the next hop.
The key information transmitted between adjacent Diameter peers is the current
server load as well as an indication of overload state and severity (overload
information). Both information parts are conveyed as a new Grouped AVP (Load-
Info AVP), included into CER/CEA, DWR/DWA and any Diameter messages in which
the Grouped AVP Load-Info can be included.
The Load-Info AVP is defined as follow:
\ ::= \
> \
>
> * { Overload-Info-Scope }
>
> [ Supported-Scopes ]
>
> * [ Overload-Algorithm ]
>
> [ Period-Of-Validity ]
>
> [ Session-Group ]
>
> [ Load ]
>
> * [ AVP ]
The Overload-Metric AVP is used as input to the load mitigation algorithm. Its
definition and interpretation is left up to each individual algorithm, with
the exception that an Overload-Metric of \"0\" always indicates that the node
is not in overload (that is, no load abatement procedures are in effect) for
the indicated scope.
The Overload-Info-Scope AVP is used to indicate to which scope the Overload-
Metric applies. The indication of scopes for overload information allows a
node to indicate a subset of requests to which overload information is to be
applied. Seven scopes are defined in the IETF draft but only \"Connection\"
scope is mandatory to implement for all the nodes supporting this overload
control mechanism.
The Supported-Scopes AVP contains a bitmap that indicates the scope(s) that a
given node can receive on the connection. This AVP is only used in CER/CEA.
The Overload-Algorithm AVP may be used only in CER/CEA to negotiate the
algorithm that will be used for load abatement. If absent of this AVP in
CER/CEA, the default Overload Algorithm (Loss) is used.
The Period-Of-Validity AVP is used to indicate the length of time, in seconds,
the Overload-Metric is to be considered valid (unless overridden by a
subsequent Overload-Metric in the same scope).
The Session-Group AVP is used to assign a new session to the session group
that it names. This AVP may appear only once, in the answer to a session-
creating request. This AVP will may allow to apply the overload algorithm to a
group of session if the \"Session-Group\" scope is applied.
The Load AVP is used to indicate the load level of the scope in which it
appears. The load level is indicated as a linear scale, from 0 (least loaded)
to 65535 (most loaded).
The IETF draft also defines a default overload algorithm for shedding traffic
under overload circumstances. Identified by the indicator \"Loss\" (1) in
Overload-Algorithm AVP and meant to be implemented by all the Diameter nodes
supporting the overload control mechanism, this algorithm allows a Diameter
peer to ask its peers to reduce the number of requests they would ordinarily
send by a specified percentage. In this algorithm, a range from 0 to 100 is
used as possible values of Overload-Metric AVP to indicate the requested
percentage of traffic reduction. For example, if a peer requests to another
peer a reduction of 10% of the traffic currently sent, then that peer will
redirect, reject, or treat as failed, 10% of the traffic that would have
otherwise been sent to this Diameter node. When the requests have to be
treated as failed by a Diameter agent, the Diameter agent indicates to the
peer who originated the request by sending a new error code
\"DIAMETER_PEER_IN_OVERLOAD\" in the response.
The design of the mechanism described in this document allows for the
definition of alternate load abatement algorithms as well and the algorithm to
apply is negotiated during the capabilities exchange phase between the peer.
## 7.3 Solution 2: DOCA
### 7.3.1 Solution Overview
\"The Diameter Overload Control Application (DOCA)\" (IETF Draft draft-
korhonen-dime-ovl-01 [24]) describes a new application, the Diameter Overload
Control Application (DOCA), to convey overload information between Diameter
nodes.
This new session-stateless Diameter application defines a command pair, DOCA-
Report-Request/Answer (DRR/DRA), and a set of AVPs to convey the related
overload control information. Any the DOCA capable Diameter node can initiate
a DOCA-Report-Request at any given time. The receiver of the request
acknowledges with a DOCA-Report-Answer and includes the Result-Code AVP
indicating whether it could honor the action/report in the request. The DOCA-
Report-Answer can also piggyback overload control information related the node
sending the answer.
A Diameter proxy supporting the DOCA application can inspect the DOCA related
AVPs in the DRR/DRA message pair and, depending on the value of the OC-Scope
AVP, it can inject its own information in the messages.
The DOCA-Report-Request (DRR) message is used to report overload condition
information. The message can be originated as a result of emerging overload
condition or as a periodic unsolicited report.
The DOCA-Report-Answer (DRA) message is used as an acknowledge response to the
DOCA-Report-Request. The message can also piggyback overload condition
information in order to avoid unnecessary DOCA-Report-Request messages to the
reverse direction.
The IETF draft defines the following AVPs related to the overload control
mechanism:
The OC-Scope AVP indicates in a bitmask the scope where and concerning what
the overload control information contained in OC-Information can be injected.
The following scopes are supported:
\- \"Host\": OC-Information AVP concerns only a single host within a realm
(which internally MAY represent of pool).
\- \"Realm\": OC-Information AVP concerns a realm. No specific hosts are
identified.
\- \"Only origin realm\": OC-Information AVP can only be included by a
Diameter node on the path that has the same Origin-Realm as the DOCA client.
\- \"Application information\": OC-Information AVP contains application
related information (the OC-Applications AVP).
\- \"Node utilization information\": OC-Information AVP contains node wide
load related information (the OC-Utilization AVP).
\- \"Application priorities\": OC-Information AVP contains priority
information (the OC-Priority AVP) so when the overload condition is on,
Diameter nodes are able to prioritize between different applications, for
example, when dropping or throttling messages.
The OC-Algorithm AVP, used only in the DRR message, is a bitmask that
indicates the supported algorithms to mitigate the overload condition. The
following algorithms are supported:
\- \"Drop\": Messages are plain dropped. It is RECOMMENDED to drop messages
selectively based, for example, on application priorities. This is the default
algorithm.
\- \"Throttle\": The message sending rate is according to the OC-Sending-Rate
AVP.
\- \"Prioritize\": Apply priorities among applications and the other used
means for holding traffic.
The OC-Action AVP indicates three different states: the start, the end or the
update of the overload condition. The interim is the default value and can be
sent during the overload condition or during the normal condition.
The OC-Tocl AVP, used only in the DRR message, indicates in a DRR a timer in
milliseconds that defines the requested interval for sending periodic DOCA-
Report-Request messages with the OC-Action AVP set to \'Interim\'. The value
of zero (0) means no periodic DOCA-Report-Request messages are sent or
desired. The default value is 120000.
The OC-Applications AVP is a Grouped AVP that contains a list of Application-
IDs of interest and meant to be used during the initialization state to agree
on the common set of supported applications of monitoring interest when found
in the DOCA-Report-Request/Answer command main level. When used within the OC-
Information AVP, the OC-Applications AVP identifies those applications the
overload information concerns.
The OC-Information AVP is a Grouped AVP that contains a set AVPs that identify
the source of the overload control information, the overload information
itself and which applications the information concerns.
## 7.4 Solution 3: OVLI
### 7.4.1 Solution overview
\"The Diameter Overload Indication Conveyance\" (OVLI) (IETF Draft draft-ietf-
dime-ovli-01 [25]) defines a base solution for Diameter Overload Control
(DOC), The solution defined in this IETF draft addresses the Diameter overload
control between two endpoints. Furthermore, the solution is designed to apply
to existing and future Diameter applications, requires no changes to the
Diameter base protocol specified in IETF RFC 6733[2] and is deployable in
environments where some Diameter nodes do not implement the Diameter overload
control solution defined in this specification.
Overload control information is generated by a reporting node (e.g. a Diameter
server) and is transferred in an overload report (OLR) to a reacting node
(e.g. a Diameter client) that will consume and act upon a report. Diameter
agents may also act as a reporting or a reacting node.
The overload report requests a percentage of reduction on the traffic of a
given Diameter application towards either a Destination Host or a Destination
Realm according to the type of the OLR. The OLR is conveyed in Diameter
commands answers .The OLR does not contain explicit information to which
application it applies or whom the specific OLR concerns to. This information
is implicitly learned from the encapsulating Diameter message/command. The
application the OLR applies to is the same as the Application-Id found in the
Diameter message header. The identity the OLR concerns is determined from the
Origin-Host AVP or Origin-Realm AVP found from the encapsulating Diameter
command. The OLR is intended to be sent only by a reporting node.
The primary objective is to address the overload of servers; the solution
allows future extensibility by defining OLRs to support e.g. the overload of a
Diameter agent or to handle other requested actions.
The OLR is conveyed in the hereafter OC-OLR AVP:
OC-OLR ::= \
> \
>
> [ OC-Report-Type ]
>
> [ OC-Reduction-Percentage ]
>
> [ OC-Validity-Duration ]
>
> * [ AVP ]
A negotiation capability allows to define the overload control mechanism to be
used between endpoints through an OC-Supported-Features information element.
The current solution only supports the overload control mechanism described
above and based on a percentage of traffic reduction but this capability
negotiation allows introducing new overload control mechanism or features.
The OC-Supported-Features is conveyed in the hereafter OC-Supported-Features
AVP:
OC-Supported-Features ::= \
> \
>
> [ OC-Feature-Vector ]
>
> * [ AVP ]
The OC-Feature-Vector sub-AVP is used to announce the DOC features supported
by the endpoint, in the form of a bit mask in which each bit announces one
feature or capability supported by the node.
## 7.5 Comparison
The 3GGP strategy is to rely on the Diameter overload solution defined by IETF
in draft-ietf-dime-ovli and its evolution and in other IETF documents defining
extensions when available. There is currently no other solution to compare
with the above IETF solution.
Hereafter is presented how the IETF draft solution fulfils requirements for
Diameter Overload Control described in clause 6.

## 7.6 Conclusions
The analysis in clause 7.5 regarding the fulfillment of the IETF draft
solution towards the 3GPP requirements shows that the solution covers a very
large amount of requirements, sometimes with some limitations. In particular,
the protocol to transfer load information and the handling of Diameter agent
overload are further extensions to be considered. The solution is applicable
now without these extensions.The solution as currently defined in the IETF
Draft draft-ietf-dime-ovli-01[25] is recommended as the basis for 3GPP
applications environment given that specific application complements could be
added on a per application basis e.g. about the node behavior regarding the
type of messages of an application to throttle first. 3GPP will take into
account the evolution of this IETF draft until being an RFC, while analyzing
and evaluating the changes in each of the future version for the impact on
3GPP.
# 8 Conclusions and Recommendations
## 8.1 Introduction
The following clauses provide general recommendations for the support of an
overload control mechanisms over Diameter-based 3GPP interfaces and
applications. Some impacts on existing interfaces are highlighted for
illustration.
## 8.2 Solution for Diameter Overload Control in 3GPP Networks
The technical report addresses some other topics which are not covered in the
IETF draft draft-ietf-dime-ovli-01 [25]). Two of which are covered below:
  * Load balancing exists in the existing Diameter based 3GPP networks and does not rely on a standardized way to define and transfer the load information. This practice does not preclude the use of the IETF draft solution for overload. Load balancers may benefit from the overload information that is transferred through them. The standardization of the load information to be transferred with a Diameter based network is considered as useful for 3GPP but is not required for Release 12.
  * Security: Overload information is sensitive as some other Diameter data. To secure their Diameter based network, operators apply diverse methods from which the overload information data may benefit without requiring specificities. Additional standardization improving the security of the transfer of Diameter data is considered as useful for 3GPP but is not required for Release 12.
There are pending points under discussion in IETF regarding the new versions
of the IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-ovli-01 [25]. They don't constitute critical
issues for the normal progress of the 3GPP standardization work. The usage of
some of the functionalities or of the overload information defined in the IETF
draft may depend of the Diameter application (e.g. use of the overload report
for a realm).
Referring to conclusions of clause 7.6, the solution as currently defined in
the IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-ovli-01 [25] is recommended as the basis for a
usage in 3GPP Diameter applications given that this usage and specific
complements will be defined per Diameter application.
The 3GPP working groups can start their normative work on the use of this
solution for the 3GPP Diameter applications under their responsibility, taking
into account the evolution of the IETF draft to a RFC, while analyzing and
evaluating the changes in each of the future version for the impact on 3GPP.
## 8.3 Impacts on Existing 3GPP Specifications
### 8.3.1 Introduction
This clause provides an overview of the foreseen considerations on affected
existing 3GPP specifications. It is up to each specification to decide how
specifically these guidelines may be incorporated.
### 8.3.2 Considerations on existing 3GPP specifications
Diameter 3GPP interfaces are recommended to implement the Diameter overload
control mechanism defined by IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-ovli-02 [25].
The following considerations would apply:
\- OC-Supported-Features as defined by IETF draft [25] is used by each
application. 3GPP Supported-Features is not used for DOIC advertisement and/or
capability negotiation, since DOIC advertisement and capabilities negotiation
traversing non-3GPP intermediate Diameter Agents requires the usage of OC-
Supported-Features AVP.
\- There are not impacts at 3GPP applications protocol level since DOIC AVPs
are defined as optional.
\- Each DOIC supporting 3GPP application includes OC-Supported-Features AVP in
all requests, acting as a reacting node. Therefore, the DOIC supporting 3GPP
application that receives these requests acts as reporting node and then it is
required to include OC-Supported-Features plus OC-OLR AVPs, as per IETF draft
[25].
\- A reporting node starts requesting traffic reduction when it enters into an
overload condition. How a reporting node determines it is entering into an
overload condition is implementation dependent.
\- How a reporting node determines the contents value of the overload report
(i.e. OC-OLR AVP) is implementation dependent.
\- How a reacting node achieves requested traffic reduction is implementation
dependent. For example, the reacting node may implement message throttling
with prioritization or a message retaining mechanism for operations that can
be postponed.
\- Each 3GPP application acting as a reporting node will define the Report-
Type and the mitigation algorithm to be used.
NOTE: IETF draft [25] defines one single algorithm that is used as the default
mitigation algorithm.
### 8.3.3 Impacts on the S6a/d interface
#### 8.3.3.1 General
The following clauses illustrate some impacts of the Diameter overload control
mechanism defined by IETF Draft draft-ietf-dime-ovli-02 [25] on the S6a/d
interface. Further impacts may be described in the 3GPP TS 29.272 [6] when
updated to support the IETF standard overload control mechanism.
#### 8.3.3.2 Mapping to NAS causes
##### 8.3.3.2.1 Introduction
When the DOIC mechanism for overload control is used over the S6a/d interface,
the way the MME/SGSN will behave towards the UE is a key concern, especially
when a high and repeated signalling from large amounts of UEs (signalling
\"storms\") occurs.
An important point is on how the MME/SGSN should react towards the UEs when
receiving UE requests over NAS. The MME/SGSN may be driven according to
implementation and operator policy to reject such requests with the presence
of a NAS cause allowing the UE to determine its future behaviour.
Annexes A and B in 3GPP TS 29.272 [6] define a mapping of Diameter error cases
and some other events to NAS causes sent to the UE.
##### 8.3.3.2.2 Existing NAS cause mapping
When the MME /SGSN receives a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY error, the MME/SGSN may reject
the corresponding request from the UE. The Annex A and B in 3GPP TS 29.272 [6]
tables do not indicate to which NAS cause the DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY error shall be
mapped,
Hereafter are reminded characteristics of some NAS causes:
\- Cause #17 \"Network failure\". Here the UE starts the timer T 3411 (value
10s) where it can retry 5 times after which it will use the timer T3402
(default value of 10 minutes) (cf 3GPP TS 24.301 [27] clause 10.2) before any
new attempt. This cause may generate many attempts from the UE.
\- Cause #22 \"Congestion\": here the MME/SGSN can send a value for the Timer
T3346, or if not, the UE can choose a random value between 15-30 minutes (cf
3GPP TS 24.008 [26] clause 11.2.2);
\- Cause #42 \"Severe network failure\" (for the MME case): here the UE shall
start an implementation specific timer setting its value to 2 times the value
of T as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [28] with a minimum value of 6 minutes for
T.
Annex A and B do not give indication on the NAS cause to be used when there is
no answer to the S6a/d request.
##### 8.3.3.2.2 NAS cause mapping proposals
###### 8.3.3.2.2.1 Active OLR
When DOIC mechanism is used over S6a, the MME/SGSN may reject requests
received from the UEs over NAS such as Attach, Tracking Area Update/Routing
Area Update or Service Requests s for the following events:
\- MME/SGSN dropping the corresponding S6a request with a destination host
related to the active host OLR, or a request without a destination host but
with a destination realm related to the active realm OLR;
\- Reception of a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY error for the corresponding S6a request,
with an active OLR (HSS has indicated an overlaod situation) for the related
host or realm;
\- No answer to a request when an active OLR for the related host or realm.
For these events, it is recommended to use the cause #22. Timer T3346 may be
set according to operator policies. Its value may be chosen by taking into
account the level of the traffic reduction requested by the active OLR, so to
defer and spread over time later attempts from the UE according to the
severity of the overload over S6a. Reasons of this choice are:
\- Cause #22 is dedicated to congestion so fits an overload situation.
\- The possibility to add a timer value gives flexibility to drive the future
UE attempts, and also to take into account the impact on the user experience,
by avoiding to defer too much a future UE attempt
It may be questioned if cause #22 is the only value that shall be used in the
above cases. Regarding the cause #42, an operator, in case of a severe
overload, may prefer to use this cause. So it may be left to an operator
policy the possibility to also choose the cause #42, although the cause #22 is
the recommended one. This will be further discussed when updating the 3GPP TS
29.272 [6] to support the Diameter overload control mechanism defined by IETF
Draft draft-ietf-dime-ovli-02 [25] over the S6a/d interface.
In the case of no answer to a request, the MME/SGSN being aware of an overload
condition for the host or realm related destination, may avoid to repeat the
Diameter message, so to not increase the traffic with this destination and to
react towards the UE with the appropriate NAS cause listed above.
###### 8.3.3.2.2.2 No Active OLR
In this situation, DOIC mechanism is supported and there is no active OLR for
a given host or for a realm; the MME/SGSN, for a request related to this host
destination or to this destination realm without a destination host, .may
nevertheless receives a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY error or not receive an answer from
this host or realm.
For this situation and by homogeneity with the active OLR case, if the
MME/SGSN rejects the request from the UE, it is also recommended to use the
cause #22 as with an active OLR (c.f. 8.3.3.2.2.1). The cause #42 is here not
meaningful.
In the case of no answer to a request, as there is no overload condition,
prior rejecting the request from the UE, the MME may repeat the Diameter
message as according to the Diameter base protocol.
However, further studies are needed to decide whether it is required to keep
homogeneous reactions regarding DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY and no answer as when the
DOC mechanism is supported.
###### 8.3.3.2.2.3 DOIC not supported
In this situation, the MME/SGSN does not support the DOIC mechanism. By
homogeneity with the case where the DOIC mechanism is supported, if the
MME/SGSN receives a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY error or does not receive an answer
after possible repetitions, and if the MME/SGSN rejects the corresponding
request from the UE, it is recommended that the MME/SGSN should use the cause
#22. The MME/SGSN may set the timer to a value according to a local policy
(e.g. according to the number of Diameter too busy errors it is receiving).
The cause #42 may also be used in case of a severe overload evaluation
according to operator policy.
However, further studies are needed to decide whether it is required to keep
homogeneous reactions regarding DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY and no answer as when the
DOC mechanism is supported.
## 8.4 Recommendations for New Diameter Applications
For new Diameter applications, the general recommendations given in the clause
8.3.2 still apply.
###### ### Annex A: PCRF Overload Impacts per Interface
This annex describes the impact of the PCRF overload on different interfaces.
It is meant to serve as a complement to clause 5.3.3.
## A.1 Impacts due to the overload of the PCRF
### A.1.1 Impacts when a DRA is not deployed
#### A.1.1.1 Impacts on the Gx interface
The following requests may be impacted:
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to INITIAL_REQUEST: these requests are used to
set up an IP-CAN session.
\- If the PCRF explicitly rejects such a request with DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, the
PCEF may either:
\- Send the request to another PCRF if possible, i.e. if the PCEF is connected
to multiple PCRFs and the scenario/configuration allows it. This isn't
possible for example if the corresponding Gxx session has already been
established with the "busy" PCRF as sending the Gx request to a different PCRF
will result in Gx and Gxx sessions not being linked, causing the gateway
control session to not get the proper QoS rules and as such, potentially
impacting the end user's traffic.
\- Reject the IP-CAN session establishment towards the UE if the above is not
possible. This would cause the PDN connection establishment to fail and
potentially cause the UE to retry, causing additional load on the network.
\- Apply local policy without rejecting the PDN connection establishment. This
would not cause further load on the network; however, the services provided to
the UE could be limited and potentially have charging impacts. In this case,
the PCEF could re-attempt the Gx session establishment at a later point when
the PCRF is deemed not busy (see clause 5.2.3 for limitations related to this
procedure).
\- If the PCRF drops the request, the PCEF will eventually time out the CCR
transaction and may behave as follows:
\- Retry the request at a later time; this would cause delays in the PDN
connection setup. If the PCRF is still busy then and drops the request, the
PCEF will need to resort to one of the options specified above in the handling
of the DIAMTER_TOO_BUSY result-code.
\- Apply one of the behaviours defined in the DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY handling.
\- If the connection to the PCRF is dropped or unavailable, the PCEF may
behave as follows:
\- Send the request to an alternate PCRF if applicable and possible given the
scenario/configuration.
\- Send/Retry the request when the connection to the PCRF is restored. This
option should be only used if the above option isn't possible and the time
budget is not exceeded as explained in 5.3.3.2.3.
\- Reject the IP-CAN session establishment as specified in the
DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY handling.
\- Apply local policy without rejecting the PDN connection establishment.
\- CCR update requests: these requests are used to update an IP-CAN session.
Such updates can be due to various reasons, e.g. RAT change, location update,
request of bearer modification, , usage reporting, etc. In this case, update
requests cannot be sent to another PCRF.
\- If the PCRF explicitly rejects such a request with DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, the
PCEF may either:
\- Reject the PDN connection update procedure. This can have a number of
impacts, depending on the reason for the update. For example, a RAT change
could cause the handoff to the new access to fail. If the target access is the
only one available, this could cause service interruption.
\- Deactivate the PDN connection. Although this is a drastic measure, if the
PCEF can communicate with multiple PCRFs, it may allow the PDN connection re-
establishment to be sent to an available and non-busy PCRF, as such
potentially restoring service to the end user.
\- Apply local policy without rejecting the PDN connection update. This has
similar implications as the ones specified for the IP-CAN session
establishment case. Additionally, this could have impact on other existing
sessions, such as Rx for instance. If the IP-CAN session update was related to
information relevant to the Rx session (e.g. associated rule failure, loss of
bearer, etc.), the AF would not be informed of such events.
\- If the PCRF drops the request, the PCEF will eventually time out the CCR
transaction and may behave as follows;
\- Retry the request, which would cause further load on the busy PCRF.
\- Apply one of the behaviours specified for the DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY case.
\- If the connection to the PCRF is dropped or unavailable, the PCEF may
behave as follows:
\- Send/Retry the request when the connection to the PCRF is restored.
\- Apply one of the behaviours specified for the DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY case.
\- CCR termination requests: these requests are used to terminate an IP-CAN
session. The PCEF should either re-attempt the Gx session termination at a
later time or simply clean up its session context locally. The impacts in case
the session isn't properly cleaned up at the PCRF is that other related
sessions (e.g. Rx, S9, etc.) will not be properly aborted or updated.
#### A.1.1.2 Impacts on the Gxx interface
The following Gxx requests may be impacted:
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to INITIAL_REQUEST: these requests are used to
set up a gateway control session. This request can be initiated based on
different events: PDN connection establishment or BBERF relocation for case 2b
(as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [12]) and local IP address assignment for case
2a (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [12]).
\- If the PCRF explicitly rejects such a request with DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, the
BBERF may behave as follows:
\- Send the request to a different PCRF in case 2a if such PCRF is available,
or in case 2b if this request was due to an IP-CAN session establishment,
assuming the scenario (non-roaming)/configuration allows for it.
\- In case 2b and BBERF relocation, sending the request to an alternate PCRF
is not possible as the Gxx session has to be linked with the previously set up
Gx session. As such, the handling of this case is similar to a session update
where the BBERF cannot choose another PCRF to handle the request.
\- Reject the triggering request to establish the gateway control session.
This can lead to the PDN connection establishment to fail in case 2b or for
the UE not to potentially not be able to attach in case 2a.
\- Apply local policies and accept the request. The implications here are that
the Gxx and corresponding Gx session will not be linked, causing a potential
mismatch in QoS rules.
\- If the PCRF drops the request or the connection or the connection isn't
available, in addition to the above options, the BBERF can retry the request
again to the same PCRF (when and if the connection is available), which could
cause further load on the PCRF and a delay in the gateway control session
establishment.
\- CCR update requests: these requests are used to update a gateway control
session. Such updates are usually sent due to either a resource modification
request or a QoS rule failure notification. Such requests cannot be sent to
alternate PCRFs; the impact and possible behaviors of the BBERF are similar to
the Gx case and PCEF.
\- CCR termination requests: these requests are used to terminate a gateway
control session. The behaviour of the BBERF is similar to the PCEF handling in
the case of Gx.
#### A.1.1.3 Impacts on the Rx interface
Rx sessions are dependent on the existence of the corresponding Gx session. As
such, the impact of PCRF overload on Rx is different from the other
applications.
The following are Rx requests initiated by an AF:
  * AAR to setup a session: These requests are sent to either perform the initial provisioning of session information related to media flows or to establish a session associated with the AF signalling session.
\- If the PCRF explicitly rejects such a request with DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, the
AF may behave as follows:
\- Reject the corresponding procedure that triggered the Rx AAR. Depending on
the AF and procedure, the impact would vary. For example, in the case of IMS
and Rx AAR triggered by a SIP REGISTER, rejecting the SIP registration will
not allow the user to establish or receive calls. On the other hand, if the Rx
AAR is triggered by a SIP INVITE, rejecting it would impact the call being
established. In both cases, the likelihood is that the UE will re-attempt the
failed procedure and as such, further contributing to the PCRF and potentially
P-CSCF/SIP load.
\- Allow the AF procedure to complete and apply local policy. The drawback in
this approach is that it could have charging and QoS impacts. The AF could in
addition retry the Rx request at a later time.
\- If the PCRF drops the AAR or if the connection is dropped/not available,
the AF can retry the request at a later time. In this case, the AF procedure
can be allowed (e.g. in the case of IMS, the SIP procedure), so no delay is
incurred while waiting to retry the Rx request. Eventually, if enough retries
fail, the AF would need to resort to one of the options above.
\- AAR to update an existing session. The AF may behave similarly to session
establishment. The impact on the UE may differ here as rejecting a session
modification may not be as impactful as rejecting a session establishment. For
example, in the case of IMS, if a SIP re-INVITE is sent to add video to an
audio only call, the video may not be added, but the audio call can continue
without being impacted.
\- STR to terminate a session. The AF may behave similarly to the PCEF on
session termination, i.e. clean up session state locally or retry the request
at a later time. The impact of simply cleaning up state locally is that the
corresponding Gx session would end up with "stale" PCC rules, possibly causing
dedicated resources to be held up in the RAN and possibly having charging
impacts.
#### A.1.1.4 Impacts on the S9 interface
##### A.1.1.4.1 Introduction
The S9 interface is used between a V-PCRF and an H-PCRF. It carries both S9
and Rx application messages. There are different cases that need to be
analysed:
\- Overload of the V-PCRF
\- Overload of the H-PCRF
Additionally, we need to consider the home routed case as well as the visited
access case.
One of the main differences with the non-roaming case is that S9 is an inter-
operator interface and as such, corresponding traffic goes through IPX and
traverses multiple Diameter agents (e.g. DEA, etc.). Additionally, operators
typically hide their internal topology from other operators. As such, if the
H/V-PCRF is overloaded and responds back to an S9 request with
DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, the error the V/H-PCRF will receive may be
DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY or other errors as intermediaries may modify the original
result code especially that the responding PCRF's identity is not typically
included in the answer seen by the requesting PCRF. As such, properly handling
the overload of the H/V-PCRF with the current standard procedures will be
challenging.
##### A.1.1.4.2 Overload of the H-PCRF
In the home routed case, all the interfaces go to the H-PCRF except for Gxx
which terminates on the V-PCRF in case 2a and case 2b as defined in 3GPP TS
29.213 [12]. If the H-PCRF is overloaded, the impact on Gx, Sd, Rx is similar
to the non-roaming case. The impact on S9 is similar to the impact on Gxx in
the non-roaming case. Specifically because S9 in this case is only used to
convey gateway control session related procedures. Note that although the
impact to S9 is similar to Gxx, it does differ due to the multitude of agents
and IPX it needs to traverse as explained in 5.3.3.2.3.a.d.
In the visited access case, all the interfaces go to the V-PCRF except for
certain cases where the AF is in the H-PLMN, in which case Rx goes to the
H-PCRF. In this case, the impact of the H-PCRF overload on the V-PCRF is
similar to the impact of the PCRF overload on the PCEF in the non-roaming
case. The V-PCRF may be unable to request PCC rules from the H-PCRF or report
events happening in the V-PLMN. In these cases, the V-PCRF would need to act
based on operator policies and roaming agreements and either reject the
requests that triggered S9 (e.g. Gx, Gxx) or respond successfully back to its
clients if the scenario and roaming agreements allow it.
##### A.1.1.4.3 Overload of the V-PCRF
The V-PCRF acts as the client over the S9 interface. However, it acts as a
server to locally connected clients (e.g. BBERF). From the H-PCRF perspective,
the V-PCRF acts as its point of contact to provision decision rules and
information on the corresponding BBERF/PCEF/TDF in the V-PLMN. With regards to
Rx messages, the V-PCRF may act as a proxy or as a client/server when sending
these messages over the S9 reference point. When the V-PCRF is overloaded, its
impacts to the H-PCRF are similar to impacts of an overloaded DRA. The impact
of the V-PCRF overload to other entities (e.g. BBERF) are similar to the
overload of a PCRF in the non-roaming case.
#### A.1.1.5 Impacts on the Sd interface
The Sd interface can be used in two ways: solicited and unsolicited. The
impacts of overload of the PCRF vary depending on the mode and procedure.
The following messages may be impacted:
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to INITIAL_REQUEST: this request is sent by
the TDF to establish an Sd session with the PCRF in the unsolicited reporting
case. Given that the Sd session has to be bound to an existing Gx session, the
TDF cannot send this request to a different PCRF. The impact on the TDF in
this case is that the session establishment will have to be delayed and
retried at a later time. The impact is simply that the PCRF isn't informed of
the potentially detected applications on the TDF until the session
establishment can succeed.
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to UPDATE_REQUEST: this request is sent by the
TDF for various reasons, including application detection, usage reporting,
etc. Whether the PCRF responds with DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY or drops the request,
the TDF should retry the request later if it's still applicable (e.g.
application that was detected is still running). This is especially critical
in cases of usage reporting as their impacts go beyond the IP-CAN session.
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to TERMINATION_REQUEST: this request is
initiated by the TDF based on a request from the PCRF to release the session.
In this case, if accumulated usage has not been reported to the PCRF, the TDF
should attempt to retry the request at a later time. Otherwise, the TDF can
clean up its session context locally.
## A.2 Impacts when a DRA is deployed
When a DRA is deployed between the clients and the PCRF, the impact of PCRF
overload may be different than the deployment with no DRA. In this clause, we
will only analyse additional impacts due to the DRA.
A DRA can be deployed in three different modes as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213
[12]:
\- Proxy agent always in the path, also referred to as PA1
\- Proxy agent in the path on session establishment and certain session
termination messages, also referred to as PA2
\- Redirect agent
The redirect DRA is not in the path of messages from/to the PCRF. As such, it
cannot intercept error responses, realize that requests were dropped,
connections lost, etc. For this reason, the only DRA modes that are analysed
in this clause are PA1 and PA2.
### A.2.1 Impacts on the Gx interface
Below are the impacts of the PCRF overload on Gx when a DRA is deployed:
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to INITIAL_REQUEST. If the PCRF returns a
DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY response and if the scenario/configuration allows the DRA to
select another PCRF, the DRA can select another PCRF that is available and not
busy. In the case where the request is dropped by the PCRF, the DRA may be
able to retry the request to the same PCRF or select an alternate PCRF if the
scenario/configuration allows it. Similarly, when the connection to the PCRF
is dropped/unavailable, the DRA may be able to select an alternate PCRF if
applicable to send/retry the request when the connection is restored. If the
DRA is unable to select a PCRF to successfully process the request, it should
respond back to the PCEF with an error. The error should be carefully chosen
to properly convey the error to the PCEF without causing unnecessary
retransmissions (e.g. DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER when the PCRF is busy) or
misrepresentations (e.g. sending DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY when the DRA itself is not
busy and the request was not directed to a specific PCRF). There aren't very
appropriate result codes that are currently available in the IETF or 3GPP
specs for this case.
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to UPDATE_REQUEST. The DRA cannot send this
request to other PCRFs. As such, it can retry the request before responding to
the client or simply respond back to the client with an error. If the PCRF had
returned a DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, the DRA may relay this error code. Otherwise, if
the request was dropped, the DRA may respond with DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER.
\- CCR with CC-Request-Type set to TERMINATION_REQUEST. The DRA can:
\- Respond successfully to the PCEF and retry the termination request to the
overloaded PCRF later.
\- Alternatively update its binding by removing the corresponding session.
This could impact all associated sessions (e.g. Rx) as the DRA may not be able
to route such requests to the corresponding PCRF. In this case, the DRA can
respond back to the PCEF either successfully or with a permanent error to
avoid further retransmissions of the termination request from the client.
### A.2.2 Impacts on the Gxx interface
The impacts when a DRA is deployed are similar to the Gx interface.
### A.2.3 Impacts on the Rx interface
Rx requests have to be routed to the same PCRF that handled the corresponding
Gx session. As such, if that PCRF is overloaded, the DRA will not be able to
re-route the requests to other PCRFs. As such, its behaviour with regards to
Rx requests will be similar to the handling of Gx update messages.
### A.2.4 Impacts on the S9 interface
In the home routed case in cases 2a and 2b, the impact on S9 based on H-PCRF
overload is similar to impacts on Gxx in the non-roaming case. Conversely, the
impact on S9 based on V-PCRF overload is similar to the overload of a DRA in
the non-roaming case as explained in clause 5.3.3.2.3.a.d.b.
### A.2.5 Impacts on the Sd interface
The impact is similar to Rx as Sd requests need to be sent to the same PCRF
that handled the corresponding Gx session.
