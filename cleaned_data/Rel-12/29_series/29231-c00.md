# 1 Scope
The present document describes the protocols to be used when SIP-I is
optionally used as call control protocol in a 3GPP CS core network on Nc
interface, see 3GPP TS 23.231 [1]. The SIP-I protocol operates between (G)MSC
servers. The SIP-I architecture consists of a number of protocols. The
following types of protocols are described: call control protocol, resource
control protocols and user plane protocol for this architecture. The
architecture complies with the requirements imposed by 3GPP TS 23.231 [1] and
TS 23.153 [2].
Interworking of SIP-I on Nc to external networks is described by TS 29.235
[3].
The present document is valid for a 3^rd^ generation PLMN (UMTS) complying
with Release 8 and later.

## 5.4 IETF RFC 3966 (The tel URI for Telephone Numbers)
The Tel-URI, in both global and local telephone formats, shall be supported as
defined in IETF RFC 3966 [6].
The \"isub\" parameter defined within IETF RFC 3966 [6] may be used to include
the ISDN sub-address as may be required within the MSISDN. See 3GPP TS 23.003
[33]. When the \"isub\" parameter is present, the \"isub-encoding\" parameter
defined within IETF RFC 4715 [34] shall be used to define the ISDN subaddress
encoding type. The procedures specified within ITU-T Q.1912.5 [4] Annex B.5
for profile C shall be applied for Sub-addressing.
## 5.5 IETF RFC 2976 (The SIP INFO method)
The SIP INFO method shall be supported as per IETF RFC 2976 [7] to allow
exchange of ISUP signalling between (G)MSC-Servers. The contents of the
message body shall not be encrypted. The SIP INFO method shall not be used to
carry any other kind of information, e.g. DTMF digits.
## 5.6 IETF RFC 3204 (MIME media types for ISUP and QSIG Objects)
Only ISUP Media Type is supported in the SIP-I based Nc interface, see ITU-T
Q.1912.5 [4] Clause 5.4.1.2.
The \"version\" parameter is used to signal the ISUP version, as per ITU-T
Q.1912.5 [4], sub-clause 5.4.1.2.
## 5.7 IETF RFC 3261(SIP: Session Initiation Protocol)
SIP-I initial and any subsequent INVITEs shall always include SDP.
3GPP SIP-I entities shall apply loose routeing on SIP-I based Nc.
SIP forking is not supported in the SIP-I Nc interface.
Race conditions for call clearing should be solved as described in clause
3.1.2 of the IETF RFC 5407 [28].
Non-INVITE transaction shall be implemented as specified in subclause 5.22 of
the present specification.
## 5.8 IETF RFC 3262 (Reliability of Provisional Responses in the Session
Initiation Protocol)
IETF RFC 3262 [10] specifies an extension to SIP in order to provide reliable
provisional response messages. As support for PRACK\'s is required for a SIP-I
based Nc interface to support preconditions, the support of 100rel is
**mandatory** for the 3GPP SIP-I profile on the Nc interface.
Procedures in clauses 3 and 4 of IETF RFC 3262 [10] apply on the Nc interface
according to the following rules:
\- A (G)MSC Server originating a SIP INVITE shall advertise its preference of
provisional reliable responses via a SUPPORTED header containing the tag
\"100Rel\".
\- A (G)MSC Server receiving a SIP INVITE will receive a SUPPORTED header
containing the tag \"100rel\" and shall include a REQUIRE header with tag
\"100rel\" and RSeq header field when sending a response in the range 101-199.
\- A (G)MSC Server receiving a response in the range 101-199 with a REQUIRE
header present with tag \"100rel\" shall generate a PRACK request for this
provisional response.
Authentication procedures are not required to be supported for PRACK (and any
other) messages.
## 5.9 IETF RFC 3264 (An Offer/Answer Model with the Session Description
Protocol)
### 5.9.1 Multicast Streams
Procedures in Clauses 5.2 and 6.2 of IETF RFC 3264 do not need to be
supported.
### 5.9.2 3GPP Node Generating the Offer
Procedures in Clause 5.1 of IETF RFC 3264 apply with the following
modifications:
\- An MSC-S initiating an offer with multiple speech codec payload types in
one m-line shall apply the related procedures in Clause 9 of 3GPP TS 23.153
[2], in particular the following requirement from IETF RFC 3264 Clause 5.1 is
overruled:
> \"_Once the offerer has sent the offer, it MUST be prepared to receive media
> for any recvonly streams described by that offer. It MUST be prepared to
> send and receive media for any sendrecv streams in the offer, and send media
> for any sendonly streams in the offer (ofcourse, it cannot actually send
> until the peer provides an answerwith the needed address and port
> information)_.\"
### 5.9.3 3GPP Node Generating the Answer
Procedures in Clause 6 of IETF RFC 3264 apply with the following
modifications:
\- If the 3GPP MSC-S terminating the codec negotiation supports multiple
speech codec payload types it shall apply the related procedures in Clause 9
of 3GPP TS 23.153 [2]. It does not need to be prepared to receive media
encoded by speech codec payload types within the answered Available Codec List
(see Clause 6.1.1).
### 5.9.4 3GPP Node as Offerer Processing of the Answer
Procedures in Clause 7 of IETF RFC 3264 apply with the following
modifications:
\- If the offering MSC supports multiple speech codecs and the MSC-S receives
an answer with multiple speech codec payload types in one m-line, it shall
apply the related procedures in Clause 9 of 3GPP TS 23.153 [2]. It does not
need to be prepared to receive media encoded by speech codec payload types
within the Available Codec List (see Clause 6.1.1) received in the answer.
### 5.9.5 Modifying the session
Procedures in Clause 8 of IETF RFC 3264 apply with the same modifications as
described in Clauses 5.9.2, 5.9.3, and 5.9.4.
### 5.9.6 Unspecified Connection Address
The use of an \"unspecified connection address\" may be used during initial
call establishment, for deferred MGW selection where no user plane connection
has been seized by the Offerer.
No further applications for the use of an \"unspecified connection address\"
are defined in SIP-I on Nc.
The \"unspecified connection address\" shall not be sent within a re-INVITE
message.
For IPv6 implementations the \"unspecified connection address\" shall be
defined by a domain name within the \".invalid\" DNS top-level domain.
For IPv4 implementations if the \"unspecified connection address\" shall be
defined by the IPv4 unspecified address (c= IN IP4 0.0.0.0).
## 5.10 IETF RFC 3311 (The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) UPDATE Method)
The SIP UPDATE method shall be supported to allow updating of session
parameters (media streams, codecs) during early and confirmed dialog, and
allow the support of preconditions.
The support of the UPDATE method shall be negotiated on SIP-I based Nc
according to the following rules:
\- A (G)MSC Server originating a SIP INVITE request shall advertise its
support of the UPDATE method via the ALLOW header listing the UPDATE method.
\- A (G)MSC Server receiving a SIP INVITE request shall include an ALLOW
header listing the UPDATE method when sending a response in the range 101-199.
The MSC-S is then allowed to generate the UPDATE method, for the purpose of
session modification during early dialog. In addition the MSC-S shall include
an ALLOW header listing the UPDATE method when sending a 2xx final response.
\- A (G)MSC Server receiving a response to a SIP INVITE request with an ALLOW
header present listing the UPDATE method is then allowed to generate the
UPDATE method.
Authentication and Integrity protection procedures are not required to be
supported for the UPDATE message.
## 5.11 IETF RFC 3312 (Integration of Resource Management and Session
Initiation Protocol)
Precondition type QoS only shall be supported using the segmented status type
(therefore end-to-end status type e.g. Clause 13.1 does not apply) and the
strength-tag value \"mandatory\" for the local segment and the strength-tag
value \"optional\" for the remote segment. Precondition tag may be included in
either REQUIRE or SUPPORTED header; the use of the SUPPORTED header is a
deviation from this RFC when the strength-tag contains a \"mandatory\" value.
## 5.12 IETF RFC 3323 (A Privacy Mechanism for the Session Initiation
Protocol)
IETF RFC 3323 [14] provides privacy requirements and mechanisms for SIP.
The Privacy header shall be supported to signal privacy of the P-Asserted-
Identity and allow or restrict the presentation of the network asserted
identity, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.231 [1]. The following privacy values may
be used: header, none, critical, id.
## 5.13 IETF RFC 3325 (Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) for Network Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks)
IETF RFC 3325 [15] provides for the existence and trust of an asserted
identity within a trust domain. It shall be supported on the SIP-I based Nc
interface with the following modifications:
\- a (G)MSC Server shall consider that neighbouring (G)MSC Servers connected
via a Nc interface are trusted;
\- the P-Preferred-Identity header and related requirements shall not be used.
## 5.14 IETF RFC 3326 (The Reason Header Field for the Session Initiation
Protocol)
The SIP Reason header provides a means of transporting SIP or ISUP/BICC cause
value in the SIP message; this is especially useful in SIP message without
encapsulated ISUP information.
The SIP Reason header shall be supported as specified by IETF RFC 3326 [16]
and by ITU-T Q.1912.5 [4] (as endorsed by sub-clause 5.1 of the present
specification), with the following modifications:
  * a Reason header field containing a Q.850 cause value shall be added to the SIP CANCEL message sent by the (G)MSC Server if the value is known; if unknown, the Q.850 cause value 31 (normal unspecified) shall be sent.
  * the header field shall not be protected by any integrity mechanism.
## 5.15 IETF RFC 4028 (Session Timers in the Session Initiation Protocol)
SIP session continuity may be supported through the use of SIP Session Timer
as per IETF RFC 4028 [24] with the following amendments.
  * Clause 4 indicates that the minimum value of the _Session-Expires_ header field should not be less than 30 minutes. Since the vast majority of mobile calls are significantly less than 30 minutes, it may be desirable to use a minimum _Session-Expires_ of less than 30 minutes within the 3GPP CS core network. The RFC states that the value SHOULD NOT be less then 30 minutes. That statement is modified to \"...MAY choose values of less than 30 minutes but greater than the absolute minimum of 90 seconds.\"
  * Clause 8 \"Proxy Behavior\" is not applicable to MSC Servers.
## 5.16 IETF RFC 4960 (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
See sub-clause 5.18.
## 5.17 Void
## 5.18 IETF RFC 4168 (The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a
Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol)
SCTP shall be the transport protocol for a SIP-I based Nc interface as per
IETF RFC 4168 [27].
Semi-permanent SCTP associations shall be established between peer 3GPP SIP-I
entities, i.e. the SCTP associations shall remain up under normal
circumstances.
Local multi-homing should be supported. Remote multi-homing shall be
supported.
Multiple local SCTP endpoints may be supported. Multiple remote SCTP endpoints
shall be supported. When multiple local or remote SCTP endpoints are
configured, several simultaneous SCTP associations shall be supported between
peer 3GPP SIP-I entities.
Published IP addresses and ports for SCTP associations are supported as
specified below:
  * The (G)MSC Server shall support SCTP association setup, where an SCTP association request is performed to a published IP address and port.
  * The (G)MSC Server may initiate SCTP association requests from a local published IP address and port.
  * The (G)MSC Server shall accept incoming SCTP association requests from remote published IP address and port.
  * When two endpoints are configured for a specific SCTP association between two published IP addresses and ports, one endpoint shall be configured as \"server\" and the peer endpoint as the \"client\" with respect to SCTP association setup.
NOTE: Published IP addresses or ports can be configured via O&M or they can be
obtained through a DNS enquiry.
Dynamically assigned ports for SCTP associations are supported as specified
below:
\- The (G)MSC Server may initiate a SCTP association from an ephemeral (non-
published) port.
\- The (G)MSC Server shall accept incoming SCTP association requests from
remote ephemeral (non-published) ports.
## 5.19 IETF RFC 791 (Internet Protocol, Version 4)
IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 [29]) shall be supported on the Nc interface.
## 5.20 IETF RFC 2460 (Internet Protocol, Version 6)
IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [30]) may be supported on the Nc interface.
## 5.21 IETF RFC 4715 (The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
Subaddress Encoding Type for tel URI)
The \"isub-encoding\" parameter defined within IETF RFC 4715 [yy] shall be
present and include the ISDN subaddress encoding type when the \"isub\"
parameter of the Tel-URI is present as defined in Clause 5.4.
## 5.22 IETF RFC 4320 (Actions Addressing Identified Issues with the Session
Initiation Protocol\'s (SIP) Non-INVITE Transaction)
The actions specified in clause 4 of the IETF RFC 4320 [35] shall be supported
with following modifications:
\- Actions which are not applicable for SCTP transport are not required to be
supported.
\- Actions specified for proxy are not applicable to MSC-S.
## 5.23 IETF RFC 5079 (Rejecting Anonymous Requests in the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP))
The response code 433 (Anonymity Disallowed) defined by IETF RFC 5079 [36]
shall be supported on SIP-I on Nc.
# 6 3GPP Extensions
## 6.1 Codec Negotiation
### 6.1.1 Encoding of 3GPP_OoBTC_Indicator
3GPP OoBTC Indicator shall be encoded as the following media-level SDP
attribute with the following syntax (ABNF definition):
3GPP_OoBTC_Indicator = \"a=3gOoBTC\"
No attribute values to this SDP attribute are defined in the present Release.
If attribute values for the attribute are received, they shall be ignored.
The SDP offer and SDP answer signalling procedures for OoBTC Indicator are
described in Clause 9 of 3GPP TS 23.153 [2].
EditorÂ´s Note: The 3GPP_OoBTC_Indicator will be registered at IANA.
### 6.1.2 Encoding of SDP answer including 3GPP OoBTC Indicator
If the 3GPP OoBTC Indicator is included in an SDP answer, the corresponding
SDP m-line shall be encoded as follows:
\- The first codec in the m-line (indicated by RTP payload type) shall
indicate the Selected Codec.
\- Any subsequent codecs in the m-line (indicated by RTP payload type), which
are not of \"auxiliary\" payload type (see next bullet), shall indicate the
Available Codec List (ACL)
\- Codecs of \"auxiliary\" payload type, i.e. RTP Telephony Event payload type
(IETF RFC 4733 [23]) or the comfort noise codec (IETF RFC 3389 [22]), may be
included as the last codecs in the m-line (indicated by RTP payload type).
## 6.2 MGW Identifier
### 6.2.1 Semantic and Usage of the MGW_Identifier
The MGW_Identifier shall be used to encode a MGW Identity as used for the
optional \"optimised MGW selection \" and \"deferred MGW selection\"
procedures in Clauses 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 of TS 23.231 [3].
Additional MGW identities may be proposed in the Additional_MGW_IDs attribute
(see subclause 6.3) for the deferred MGW selection procedure.
The support of the MGW_Identifier attribute is only required for a (G)MSC
Server that supports at least one of the optional \"optimised MGW selection \"
and \"deferred MGW selection\" procedures.
### 6.2.2 Encoding of MGW_Identifier
The MGW Identifier shall be encoded as the following \"session-level\" value
attribute with the following syntax (ABNF definition):
> MGW_Identifier = \"a=MGW_Identifier: \\"
>
> \ = _Octet string containing any octet value except 0x00 (Nul), 0x0A
> (LF), and 0x0D (CR). Values are to be interpreted as in ISO-10646 character
> set with UTF-8 encoding._
NOTE: The \ sub-field may be encoded for example in the same manner as
BCU-ID in BICC, i.e. 4 Octets for representing Network ID field and Local BCU-
ID field.
\ shall contain an operator-defined unique identifier for a MGW.
Attribute values of the SDP MGW_Identifier attribute shall not be subject to
the SDP \"charset\" attribute.
EditorÂ´s Note: The MGW_Identifier will be registered at IANA.
### 6.2.3 Procedures related to MGW_Identifier
Provided that the (G)MSC Server supports the MGW Identifier attribute, it
shall apply the following procedures:
\- For the optimised MGW selection, the (G)MSC Server shall apply the MGW
Identity related procedures in Clause 4.4.2 of TS 23.231 [3].
\- For the deferred MGW selection, the (G)MSC Server shall apply the MGW
Identity related procedures in Clause 4.4.3 of TS 23.231 [3].
## 6.3 Additional MGW Ids
### 6.3.1 Semantic and Usage of the Additional_MGW_Ids
The Additional_MGW_Ids shall be used to encode a list of MGW Identities that
may be proposed in addition to the MGW Identity signalled in the
MGW_Identifier (see subclause 6.2.1), as used for the optional \"deferred MGW
selection\" procedure in clause 4.4.3 of 3GPP TS 23.231 [3].
The support of the Additional_MGW_Ids attribute is only required for a (G)MSC
Server that supports the \"deferred MGW selection\" procedure.
### 6.3.2 Encoding of Additional_MGW_Ids
The Additional MGW Ids shall be encoded as the following \"session-level\"
value attribute with the following syntax (ABNF definition):
> Additional_MGW_Ids = \"a=Additional_MGW_Ids: \, \, ...\"
>
> \ = _Octet string containing any octet value except 0x00 (Nul), 0x0A
> (LF), and 0x0D (CR). Values are to be interpreted as in ISO-10646 character
> set with UTF-8 encoding._
NOTE: The \ sub-field may be encoded for example in the same manner as
BCU-ID in BICC, i.e. 4 Octets for representing Network ID field and Local BCU-
ID field.
\ shall contain an operator-defined unique identifier for a MGW.
Attribute values of the SDP Additional_MGW_Ids attribute shall not be subject
to the SDP \"charset\" attribute.
EditorÂ´s Note: The Additional_MGW_Ids will be registered at IANA.
### 6.3.3 Procedures related to Additional_MGW_Ids
Provided that the (G)MSC Server supports the Additional MGW Ids attribute, it
shall apply the following procedures:
\- For the deferred MGW selection, the (G)MSC Server shall apply the Deferred
MGW Ids related procedures in clause 4.4.3 of TS 23.231 [3].
