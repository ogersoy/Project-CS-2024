# Introduction
Application Servers can store their service data on the HSS through the Sh
interface as transparent data, meaning that the HSS may not be aware of the
structure and the semantics of this data, only the Application Server has this
knowledge. Standardizing the data formats would facilitate interoperation
among Application Servers supplied by the same, or different, vendors. These
Application Server vendors may be primary and secondary suppliers of the same
service provider within a service provider's IMS network. This is especially
true for the Multimedia Telephony supplementary services that can achieve a
wide deployment and are here addressed by this specification.
IMS CAMEL subscription data may be transferred to the IM-SSF AS using Sh
interface.
# 1 Scope
This specification standardizes
\- the structure and the coding of the service data that are transported over
the Sh interface between an Application Server supporting Multimedia Telephony
supplementary services as defined in 3GPPP TS 22.173 [1] and the HSS. Two
optional formats are specified. One is based on a binary coding of the service
data and supports the subset of MMTEL services corresponding to PSTN/ISDN and
CS supplementary services. The other uses an XML format and supports the full
set of MMTEL Services.
\- the structure and the coding of a set of generic IMS user group data over
the Sh interface.
\- the structure and the coding of the service data (ODB Information for IMS
Oriented Services) that are transported over the Sh interface between an
Application Server supporting services that are subject to IMS-ODB as defined
in 3GPP TS 22.041[25] and the HSS.
\- the structure and the coding of the IMS CAMEL subscription data transported
using Sh interface.

# 4 General
MMTEL/IMS CAMEL Services are supported by Application Servers that may store
the Service Data attached to each user in the HSS via the Sh Interface. This
data is referred to as transparent data and is understood syntactically but
not semantically by the HSS.
Different ASs providing MMTEL/IMS CAMEL services for a given user may be
required. Therefore several ASs should access, utilise and update the Service
Data for the user stored in the HSS. The ASs should interoperate and share the
Service Data attached to this user.
To aid the interoperability between ASs, this specification defines:
  * the structure and the coding of the Service Data transferred over the Sh interface between the HSS and the ASs for MMTEL/IMS CAMEL services,
  * the use of the Sh procedures to ensure the sharing and synchronization of these Service Data between ASs,
  * additional transfer mechanism such as base64 encoding.
Two optional formats are defined for the structure and the coding of the MMTEL
Service Data:
  * A XML format supporting the Service Data for the complete MMTEL Services.
  * A binary format supporting the Service Data for the subset of MMTEL Services corresponding to the PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary services.
An XML format is defined for the structure and the coding of the IMS CAMEL
Subscription Data.
# 5 Architecture
Figure 5-1 presents the functional architecture for AS interoperability.
Figure 5-1: Functional architecture for AS interoperability
{width="6.499305555555556in" height="2.301388888888889in"}
The MMTEL communications of a given user equipment are routed to an AS
according to the content of the filter criteria.
If AS interoperability is supported, the Service Data attached to a user shall
be stored in the HSS and the AS shall access and update, when required, the
Service Data via the Sh interface.
The user may configure some of its Service Data via the Ut interface, via SIP
based user configuration as described in 3GPP TS 24.238 [18], or via other
means.
Some Service Data is configured by the service provider e.g. from its OSS,
either directly into the HSS or via an AS that will store these Service Data
in the HSS.
The AS associated to a given user for MMTEL services may vary over time.
The same format of the Service Data stored in the HSS shall be supported for
interoperability between ASs utilising the Service Data.

## 6.2 Datasets and Service Indications
### 6.2.1 Introduction
The subclause 6.2 specifies the binary description of the service data of the
subset of MMTEL service to be stored on the HSS and corresponding to the
PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary services. Care has been taken to define rules
for extendibility, backward compatibility and compactness, since future data
structures can evolve from this definition.
The Service Data contained in the Repository Data of one Service Indication
may be a complete service suite definition, or can be viewed as a portion of a
service definition. The remaining portion of a service definition may be
comprised of elements specific to a subsequent part of the standardised
service or a later addition of elements due to new functionalities of a
service in a new release, or proprietary extensions.
To ensure these possibilities, Service Data for the binary option are grouped
in a certain number of binary datasets hereafter presented.
### 6.2.2 Datasets
The structure of datasets described in subclause 6.3.2 allows to define
different types of datasets. In this release, the following datasets are
defined:
  * the MMTELPSTN-ISDN-CS dataset containing parameters associated to the subset of MMTEL services matching the PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary services.
  * the AOC dataset containing parameters for the AOC service,
  * the FA pilot dataset containing parameters of the FA pilot in the FA service,
  * the FA member dataset containing parameters of the FA member in the FA service.
Additional services (e.g. new MMTEL services or proprietary MMTEL services)
may be defined using new datasets.
### 6.2.3 Service Indications
Dedicated Service Indications shall be used within the binary option for the
subset of MMTEL services corresponding to the PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary
services.
The Service indication with the value \"MMTEL-PSTN-ISDN-CS-BINARY\" shall have
a Service Data field containing:
  * the MMTEL-PSTN-ISDN-CS dataset.
  * the AOC dataset when the AOC service is configured for the user.
The Service indication with the value \"MMTEL-EXTENSION-BINARY-1\" shall be
used when the FA service is configured for a user and shall have a Service
Data field containing the FA dataset.
New Service Indications can be introduced in the future and associated to new
types of datasets.
Proprietary extensions shall use not standardized Service Indications. There
is no constraint for the data structure of the proprietary Service Data.
Nevertheless, the concept of dataset can be used with a proprietary content.
## 6.3 Binary coding general
### 6.3.1 Introduction
The subclause6.3 gives the general specifications to describe the MMTEL
Service data in a binary coding.
### 6.3.2 Dataset layout
The datasets are defined with a compact structure. The compact structure shall
consist:
  * of a tag-length-value format: this includes a defined 'dataset identifier' and 'length',
  * followed by a fixed format structure, wherein defined bits, bytes, 4byte tuples represent known or reserved information elements of a MMTEL service,
  * finally, to accommodate length variation of some data (e.g. SIP-URI), it accommodates a variable length section.
A dataset shall be 4-byte aligned.
Within a dataset structure, different common data forms are defined. These
include some fairly standard terms and rules, derived from common practice for
32-bit processors:
> Byte == octet
>
> Long == 4 bytes (signed and unsigned)
>
> Short == 2 bytes (signed, unsigned)
Data alignment is such that the size of the data set shall be a 4-byte
multiple and be achieved with a padding feature at the end of the dataset.
Bit fields take up only the number of bits they say they do. Alignment of bit
fields is not across a 4-byte boundary.
### 6.3.3 Order
Network byte ordering means most significant byte first.
Bit field order: Most significant bit first.
### 6.3.4 Character representation
Character representation uses UTF-8 representation.
String representations should be displayable.
### 6.3.5 Byte representation
Byte structures can be variable in length. They use the tag-length value
approach, wherein the length defines the end of a variable length byte
definition.
Variable byte structures interpreted as strings should not contain the null
character.
If no variable length data were defined, then a dataset would have fixed
length.
When there are variable length data, the dataset length will not remain
constant from subscriber to subscriber, as each may have different variable
length parameters.
### 6.3.6 Variable size data
Some data must remain flexibly defined regarding their length. Main example is
strings, such as URIs, digit-strings, IMPUs.
The fixed format part of the dataset contains the information that is used
when identifying variable length data described in the dataset. This
information comprises:
  * variable_data_offset (unsigned short ): byte offset from the dataset start
  * variable_data_length (unsigned short ): number of bytes.
The variable_data_offset is the offset (in bytes) from the beginning of
dataset to the beginning of a variable data. The variable_data_length
determines the end of the variable data. A variable_data_offset of 0 indicates
a non-provided sequence.
A specific dataset does not have a specific size, although it will at least
have a minimum size (the size if no variable data are defined at all).
The offset plus the length information shall verify:
> i. offset >= fixed size of the fixed part of the dataset (unless offset ==
> 0), and
>
> ii. offset+length \
> iii. there is no overlap between variable data.
### 6.3.7 Variable length data constraints
The following complements the usage of the pointer references (offset and
length):
a) The order of variable data values in the variable section of the dataset
shall match the order of the offset + length elements in the fixed section of
the dataset. Offsets to data shall have increasing values in the order the
offsets are encountered in the fixed portion of the dataset.
b) When the size of a variable length data field increases, the entire
variable length section of the dataset must be realigned.
c) When there is no variable data associated to an offset data, the length
shall be 0, and the offset shall have a value equal to the value of the next
offset encountered in the fixed portion of the dataset.
d) If the same data value appears more than once in a given dataset, it shall
not be implemented as two pointers to the same value.
e) Holes should not occur between variable data values.
If they do, then the AS is not responsible for maintaining the information in
these holes and alternate ASs may remove them in subsequent write actions.
f) Space after the last variable data value is not significant, and may not be
retained.
An example of a dataset with variable length data is given for information in
Annex A.
## 6.4 Binary coding of datasets
### 6.4.1 Dataset Header
Each dataset shall start with a Dataset Header.
  * DATASET_HEADER

## 6.5 Compatibility mechanism
### 6.5.1 General
The subclause 6.5 describes the mechanism to aid compatibility of the binary
format when introducing extensions to the binary option content given in
subclause 6.1.2 for new features in the services supported or for new
services.
An AS supporting the new feature/service may generate transparent data where
reserved fields of a dataset are allocated or new datasets are defined. This
transparent data may be accessed by another AS that does not support the
extensions which may cause interoperability issues.
### 6.5.2 Reserved fields
Reserved fields are defined in the datasets. An AS shall not modify the
content of such reserved fields when updating a dataset in the HSS.
### 6.5.3 Addition of new datasets
As new datasets defined according to subclause 6.2.2 may be introduced in the
same transparent data containing the MMTEL-PSTN-CS dataset and so associated
to the same service indication, an AS that does not support these new datasets
shall not modify the content of these datasets when rewriting the transparent
data in the HSS.
# 7 MMTEL service data definition based on XML
## 7.1 General principles
The general structure of the MMTEL service data document is shown in Figure
7.1-1
{width="1.2479166666666666in" height="1.8965277777777778in"}
Figure 7.1-1: General structure of MMTEL service document
The MMTEL document consists of the services. Each service consists of a user
defined part and an operator defined part. The user defined data is found in
each of the MMTEL supplementary service specifications. The operator defined
part consists of authorization of the service, and of the subscription options
for each of the services.
## 7.2 MMTEL services specification
### 7.2.0 Service Indications
A dedicated Service Indication shall be used within the XML option for MMTel
services. The value of the Service Indication shall be \"MMTEL-Services\".
Proprietary extensions shall use not standardized Service Indications. There
is no constraint for the data structure of the proprietary Service Data.

# 8 Mechanisms for transfer of Service Data between Application Server and the
HSS for AS interoperability
## 8.1 Sh procedures to transfer Service Data
Standardized procedures of the Sh interface described in 3GPP TS 29.328 [18]
are used between the AS and the HSS to access and update the Service Data
attached to a user.
To aid a proper interoperability between AS, a certain number of additional
recommendations are hereafter described:
  * After an AS has created or modified Service Data, it shall update the Service Data in the HSS with the Sh- Update procedure.
  * After an AS has downloaded Service Data from the HSS for a given user, it should subscribe to the notification of Service Data with the Sh-Subs-Notif
  * If the AS has subscribed to the notification of Service Data, the AS shall support the Sh-Notif procedure to be informed of the changes in the Service Data.
  * HSS and AS shall use Sequence Number information to ensure data synchronization
## 8.2 Base64 data encoding
As the Service Data for the binary option are in binary format, it shall be
transcoded in a character mode to be transferred over the Sh interface.
The standard used for this transcoding is the base64 encoding mechanism as
described in IETF RFC 2045 [19].
In reference to 3GPP TS 29.328 [18], Annex D, Tables D.1 and D.2, MMTEL
Service Data used for AS interoperability is defined according to Table 8.2-1
regarding the XML schema for the Sh user profile interface.

# 9 IMS user group
## 9.1 General
An IMS user group comprises a list of IMS users which are members of the group
and for which a certain service is offered specific to the group. Some generic
data with the same meaning may appear for any IMS user group, especially the
ones related to the relations between the IMS user group and its members, e.g.
the list of the users that are members of the group. This specification only
addresses the case when this generic data is stored in the HSS and transferred
to the HSS though Sh as transparent data.
This specification standardizes the coding of a set of generic IMS user group
data over the Sh interface within the repository data and the associated
service indications.
The generic IMS user group data is defined in clause 9.3
Data describing service or feature content supported by an IMS user group is
not considered as generic data associated to this IMS user group or to a
member of this IMS user group. Such data is outside the scope of this
specification.
## 9.2 Group identification and service indications
An IMS user group may be identified by
a Public Service Identity of which the form is described in 3GPP TS 23.003
[24] or
a Public User Identity when the group is identified by one of its user (e.g.
the group controller).
The group identifier is handled as part of an IMS subscription but is used
solely for Sh transparent data handling. The only intention of the IMS user
group identifier is to identify a data container into HSS. IMS subscription
management or traffic procedures of an IMS user group identifier do not apply
to the group as such or any of its members. E.g. if IMPU1 is used to identify
an IMS user group that consists of two users, identified by IMPU1 and IMPU2,
if IMPU1 is registered, it does not have any effect in the group as such, i.e.
IMPU2 registration status is not modified. The only intention of the usage of
IMPU1 as the group identifier is to identify IMPU1 as the subscriber in HSS
where the group transparent information (see 9.3.1) is stored.
The generic IMS user group data associated to an IMS user group shall be
contained in the Service Data of the Repository data with the Service
Indication having the value \"IMS-GROUP\".
The generic IMS group member data associated to an IMS user, identified by its
public user identity, that is member of one or more IMS user groups shall be
contained in the Service data of the Repository Data of this user with a
Service Indication having the value \"IMS-GROUP-MEMBER\".
When a user belongs to different IMS groups, the Service Data comprises
different subsets of IMS group member data, each associated to an IMS user
group.
## 9.3 Information elements
### 9.3.1 Information elements associated to a IMS user group
The generic IMS user group data associated to an IMS user group comprises:
\- the list of members of the IMS user group that comprises the public user
identity of each member
Specific IMS user group data in particular parameters depending of the service
content and attached to the group or to a member of the group is not
standardised in this specification. It is implementation dependent to describe
this data in repository data with specific AS dependent service indications.
### 9.3.2 Information elements associated to a IMS group member
The generic IMS user group member data of a user that is member of one or more
IMS user groups associated comprises:
\- the identities of the IMS groups to which the user belongs to
Specific group member data in particular parameters depending of the service
content of the group for this member is not standardised in this
specification. It is implementation dependent to describe this data in
repository data with specific AS dependent service indications.
## 9.4 XML schemas
### 9.4.1 XML schema of the IMS group data
The hereafter XML schema describes the structure and content of the IMS group
data. It will allow future extensions for adding new generic IMS group data.
