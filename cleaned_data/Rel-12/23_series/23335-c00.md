# Introduction
The UDC concept (3GPP TS 22.101 [3]) supports a layered architecture,
separating the data from the application logic in the 3GPP system, so that
user data is stored in a logically unique repository allowing access from core
and service layer entities, named Application Front Ends.
Network elements and functionalities should be designed to access user data
remotely and without storing them permanently locally, i.e. the Front Ends
shall work in a subscriber dateless configuration.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the procedures and signalling flows associated
to the technical realization of the 3GPP User Data Convergence (UDC). It
furthermore indicates some requirements for the stage 3 specifications.
Special consideration is put in the following areas:
\- reference architecture for the UDC concept
\- general description of procedures for the user data manipulation (e.g.
create, delete, update, etc.)
> \- identification of the requirements on the UDC for the applicability of
> the mechanisms described in this document.
User data convergence is an optional concept to ensure data consistency and
simplify creation of new services by providing easy access to the user data,
as well as to ensure the consistency of storage and data models and to have
minimum impact on traffic mechanisms, reference points and protocols of
network elements.
Standization of the Data Model for the Ud interface between Front-Ends and the
UDR is out of the scope of 3GPP.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**Front End:** a core network functional entity or service layer entity or
provisioning entity that can access user data stored in a unique repository.
**Front End Identifier** : A name that uniquely identifies an FE within the
set of all FEs accessing an UDR.
**Front End Cluster** : FEs handling the same application may be grouped in
clusters to differentiate between them e.g. with regard to geographical
location, feature support, vendor, or other characteristics. All FEs within a
cluster are treated equally for required purposes (e.g. authorization,
notifications, etc.).
**Application type:** The application handled by a FE (e.g. HLR) determines
the application type of the FE. The application type is derived from the name
indicated by a FE.
**Front End Cluster Identifier** : A name that identifies a cluster grouped
with FEs supporting the same application.
**User Data Repository:** facility where user data can be accessed stored and
managed in a common way.
**Transaction:** a transaction is a sequence of operations towards the User
Data Repository (one or several), performed as a single logical unit of work.
A logical unit of work must exhibit four properties, called the ACID
(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, to qualify as
a transaction.
A transaction usually consists of the following steps, start transaction,
making updates, and end of transaction; the transaction can finish
successfully, in that case it is said the updated data is committed, or
unsuccessfully, in that case the transaction is cancelled and the updates made
till that moment are rolled back so that the data remains as it were before
the transaction.
**Atomicity:** a transaction must be an atomic unit of work; either all of its
data modifications are performed or none of them is performed.
**Consistency:** when completed, a transaction must leave all data in a
consistent state. In the User Data Repository, all rules must be applied to
the transaction's modifications to maintain all data integrity. All internal
data structures must be correct at the end of the transaction.
**Isolation:** modifications made by concurrent transactions must be isolated
from the modifications made by any other concurrent transactions. A
transaction either sees data in the state it was in before another concurrent
transaction modified it, or it sees the data after the second transaction has
completed, but it does not see an intermediate state. This is referred to as
serialization because it results in the ability to reload the starting data
and replay a series of transactions to end up with the data in the same state
it was in after the original transactions were performed.
**Durability:** after a transaction has completed, its effects are permanently
in place in the User Data Repository. The modifications persist even in the
event of a system failure.

UDR User Data Repository
# 4 User Data Convergence architecture
## 4.1 UDC System architecture
Figure 4.1-1 presents the reference UDC architecture. UDC is the logical
representation of the layered architecture that separates the user data from
the application logic, so that user data is stored in a logically unique
repository allowing access from entities handling an application logic, hereby
named Application Front Ends.
In the architecture, the User Data Repository (UDR) is a functional entity
that acts as a single logical repository of user data and is unique from
Application Front End's perspective. Entities which do not store user data and
that need to access user data stored in the UDR are collectively known as
application front ends.
NOTE: Depending on the different network deployment, there may be more than
one UDC in an operator's network.
Application Front Ends connect to the UDR through the reference point named Ud
to access user data.
Reference points towards network elements are marked in discontinuous lines in
Figure 4.1-1, and are just shown for information purposes only. Details of the
roles of these functional entities are described in sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2,
4.2.3 and 4.2. 4.
Figure 4.1-1: UDC reference architecture
Figure 4.1-2 shows how the UDC reference architecture is related to the
overall network architecture by comparing a Non-UDC Network with an UDC
Network. In the non-UDC Network, the figure shows NEs with their own database
storing persistent user data and a NE accessing an external database; in both
cases, when UDC architecture is applied, the persistent user data are moved to
the UDR and concerned NEs are becoming Application-FEs (NE-FEs) according to
the UDC architecture. This figure also shows that network interfaces between
NEs are not impacted .A Network Element (NE), which in its original form
represents application logic with persistent data storage, when the UDC
architecture is applied, may become a NE Front End, since the related
persistent data storage is moved to the UDR.
Figure 4.1-2: Comparison Non-UDC Network to UDC Network
## 4.2 Functional Entities
### 4.2.1 Application Front Ends
Functional entities, such as the HLR/HSS/AUC, Application Servers, Access
Network Discovery and Selection Function in Home Network (H-ANDSF), any other
Core Network nodes, Provisioning system, etc., when the UDC architecture is
applied, keep the application logic, but they do not locally store user data
permanently. These data-less functional entities are collectively known in the
UDC architecture as Application Front Ends. The application that is handled by
an FE determines the type of FE. A HSS Front End may implement a full or a
part of the HSS functionalities as listed in 3GPP TS 23.002 [5], this choice
being implementation dependant. The reference points between the different
Front Ends and the core and service layers are not affected by the UDC
architecture.
### 4.2.2 Provisioning Front Ends
A Provisioning Front End is an Application Front End for the purpose of
provisioning the UDR. A Provisioning Front End provides means to create,
delete, modify and retrieve user data. However, the provisioning should not be
allowed to manipulate on the common baseline information model.
Provisioning may be associated to an application/implementation and may
comprise semantic control specific to this application. It may correspond to
different types of provisioning FEs corresponding to different applications
logics.
The UDC may support the following provisioning possibilities of user data via
Provisioning Front Ends:
\- Provisioning from self care systems interfacing subscribers or users that
should be allowed to initiate provisioning actions with a good response time.
\- Provisioning via Applications servers that often offer user service
configurations facilities (e.g. via the Ut interface) and that will control
the validity of user requests before storing the data in the UDC.
The interoperation between UDC and the provisioning system is out of the scope
of this specification.
### 4.2.3 User Data Repository
The User Data Repository (UDR) is a functional entity that acts as a single
logical repository that stores converged user data. The user-related data that
traditionally has been stored into the HSS /HLR/AuC, Application Servers,
etc., is now stored in the UDR according to a UDC information model. UDR
facilitates the share and the provisioning of user-related data throughout
services of 3GPP system.
UDR provides a unique reference point to one or more Applications Front Ends,
such as: one or more HSS/HLR/AuC-FEs, and one or more AS- FEs. The reference
point is named Ud. UDR shall provide support for multiple applications
simultaneously.
Application FEs should only be able to access the user data after proper
authentication and authorization taking into account security and privacy
requirements, i.e. it shall be possible to present different views on the data
to the parties which require access, dependent on the authorization. The UDR
shall take care of the authorization of the access to the user data. The
authorization shall be based on the requestor information, the requested data,
and the performed operation.
Ud reference point shall make use of Network Domain Security (3GPP TS 33.210
[7]) where applicable. For applications requiring sensitive data to be
transferred over Ud (e.g. permanent authentication keys), encryption shall be
required when storing these data in the UDR and transferring it over Ud.
The Application FEs managing these data shall support common algorithm(s) and
key(s) for encryption/decryption.
NOTE: Given that different FEs (e.g. HLR/AuC) belonging to the same cluster
can serve the same user, the encryption algorithm and key must be known by all
FEs serving a given user. The key is not subscriber-specific.
The UDR functional entity may be distributed over different locations or be
centralized; it may support replication mechanisms, back up functions and
geographical redundancy to secure the storage of data. These functions are out
of the scope of the present specification. They do not impact the functional
content of the reference point Ud.
The UDR shall be able to store the following types of data:
\- Permanent subscriber data: this is subscription data and relates to the
necessary information the system ought to know to perform the service. User
identities (e.g. MSISDN, IMSI, IMPU, IMPI), service data (e.g. service profile
in IMS) and authentication data are examples of the subscription data. This
kind of user data has a lifetime as long as the user is permitted to use the
service and may be modified by administration means.
\- Temporary subscriber data: this is data which may be changed as a result of
normal operation of the system or traffic conditions (e.g. transparent data
stored by Application Servers for service execution, SGSN number, user status,
etc.).
There are certain types of data, as specified in 3GPP TR 22.985 [2] that in
principle are not required to be stored in the UDR. However, it might be
beneficial to converge these data to the UDR due to, e.g., sharing of the data
within a cluster of Application Front Ends. It shall not be required that the
UDR stores the following types of data:
\- User-content data: content defined by the user and that may be quite large
in size (e.g. Photos, videos, SMS, voice mail).
\- User data that concerns event data records that can be generated on various
events in the usage of services by a user and that can be used not only for
charging or billing purposes but e.g. for user profiling regarding user
behavior and habits, and that can be valuable for marketing purposes.
\- User traffic data: this kind of user data contains call-related or session-
related dynamic data (e.g. MSRN, P-TMSI), which are typically stored in VLR,
SGSN or S-CSCF. These dynamic data are only used by their owner transitorily
and proprietarily, and hardly shared by other services in the short term.
The UDR shall offer a Provisioning Interface to the OSS which serves as a
single logical point for consistent provisioning of user data from the
operator\'s OSS system. This interface is out of scope of this specification.
### 4.2.4 Other Network Elements
Other Network Elements, which in their original form represent pure
application logic with no persistent data storage functionality but with user
data access towards an external database, when the UDC architecture is
applied, may be assumed to perform the functionality of an Application Front
End, i.e. access the user data via the Ud interface from the UDR.
## 4.3 Reference point Ud
This reference point shall allow the different FEs to create, read, modify and
delete user data stored in the UDR using the harmonized access interface.
This reference point shall support subscriptions/notifications functionality
which allows a relevant FE to be notified about specific events which may
occur on specific user data in the UDR. The events can be changes on existing
user data, addition of user data, and so on.
Through the reference point, an Application Front End shall only interface
with the UDR for the data relevant to its function, and not be impacted by
other data that UDR stores for other applications.
The user data that an Application Front End accesses in the UDR through the
reference point Ud shall comply with an agreed data structure between the
Application Front End and the UDR. Such data structure shall comply with the
Application Specific Data Model, specified in 3GPP TS 32.182 [6] and in 3GPP
TS 32.181 [8].
Reference point Ud shall support transactions. Operations and transactions
carried out over Ud shall support the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
and Durability) characteristics.
## 4.4 Front-End Session
The application logic in a Front End is performed during an FE-Session. An FE-
Session starts either with the receipt of a request message on one of the
supported interfaces from the UE, Core Network, service Layer or OSS, or with
receipt of a notification message on the Ud interface from the UDR.
Before an FE-Session starts, the FE does not have any user data stored.
During an FE-Session the FE
\- may (depending on the application logic) read user data from the UDR and
store them temporarily locally;
\- may (depending on the application logic) write user data to the UDR;
\- may (depending on the application logic) communicate with entities of the
Network or Service Layer or OSS on supported interfaces;
\- shall delete all temporarily locally stored user data when the FE-Session
is completed.
After completion of an FE-Session, the FE does not have any user data stored
and the FE does not maintain any state information. A subsequent FE-Session
for the same user triggered by a new request message on one of the supported
interfaces from the UE, Core Network, service Layer or OSS, or a new
notification message on the Ud interface from the UDR may be performed by a
different FE.
It must be noted that the FE-Session concept may have the following side
effects on the core network and service layer:
\- While in networks that do not support UDC, means are needed to route
messages destined for an HSS to the correct HSS (i.e. the HSS that serves the
user in question), networks that support UDC may deploy several HSS-FEs all of
which have access to the UDR and hence can serve any user. Instead of routing
towards the correct HSS, routing towards one of the available HSS-FE is
needed. HSS-FE selection may allow load sharing or failover; details of the
selection algorithm are operator specific and out of scope of this
specification.
\- While the FE session duration may vary (depending on the application
logic), means should be provided by the different FEs (e.g. storing temporary
data in the UDR to be shared by other FEs) so that any request may be handled
by any FE at any given time.
## 4.5 UDR Session
The UDR needs to process read accesses and write accesses received via the Ud
reference point.
When receiving a read-request the UDR shall check whether the requesting FE is
allowed to read the requested data. If it is not, the request shall be
rejected, otherwise the requested data value shall be returned to the FE
respecting the FEs data view.
When receiving a write-request the UDR shall check whether the requesting FE
is allowed to write the requested data. If it is not, the request shall be
rejected, otherwise the UDR shall
\- check whether a notification message needs to be sent via the Ud reference
point to a suitable and available FE. If so, the UDR shall send the
notification message;
\- perform the write-request and return a successful response to the FE.
# 5 User Data convergence information flows
## 5.1 General
This section documents the main procedures on the Ud reference point that are
used by the different Front Ends. These procedures are described using text
description as well as information flow diagrams. The procedures described in
this document are meant to provide a high level description and are not
intended to be exhaustive.
**In the following sections, the multiple network elements are depicted as a
single entity, since the procedures are common for all applications.**
These procedures assume that the existing network elements accept a request
message sent by any FE, e.g. a MSC/VLR accepts a MAP Cancel Location sent by
any HLR-FE, an AS accepts Sh-Notif from any HSS-FE and an S-CSCF accepts Cx-
Deregister from any HSS-FE. Figure 5.1-1 shows the general UDC information
flow. See Annex A for specific examples.
Figure 5.1-1: General UDC Information Flow
1\. The FE receives an initial request on one of the supported interfaces from
UE, Core Network, Service Layer or OSS.
2\. When receiving an initial request message, the FE may read user data from
the UDR.
3\. The FE shall store the read user data (if any) as a temporary local copy
and use it when performing its application logic. There may be applications
that do not need to retrieve and store user data from the UDR in order to
perform the application logic.
4\. The FE performs its application logic.
4a. As part of performing the application logic, the FE shall continue and
complete the communication with the UE, Core Network, Service Layer or OSS.
This may include sending messages to and receiving messages from entities
within the UE, Core Network, Service Layer or OSS other than the entity that
sent the initial request.
4b. As part of performing the application logic, the FE shall access user data
in the UDR if so required by the application. This may happen more often than
once. Steps 4a and 4b may be performed in any order of sequence.
5\. After application logic is completed, the FE shall delete its temporary
local copy of user data.
6\. The UDR shall send a notification message to an appropriate FE if the data
modified in step 4b are subscribed data for notification. The notification
message shall include user data. More than one notification messages are sent
if the modified data are subscribed more often than once.
7\. The FE shall store the received user data as a temporary local copy and
use it when performing its application logic.
8\. The FE performs its application logic.
8a. As part of performing the application logic, the FE shall communicate with
the UE, Core Network, Service Layer or OSS if so required by the application.
8b. As part of performing the application logic, the FE shall access user data
in the UDR if so required by the application. This may happen more often than
once. Steps 8a and 8b may be performed in any order of sequence.
NOTE: In the UDR step 8b may result in another notification message being sent
to an appropriate FE, which is not shown in the figure.
9\. After application logic is completed, the FE shall send a notify
acknowledgement to the UDR. Depending on the application the notify
acknowledgement may be sent earlier, e.g. immediately after step 6.
10\. After application logic is completed, the FE shall delete its temporary
local copy of user data.
## 5.2 Requirements
The following points are considered as requirements for the purpose of these
procedures.
1\. It shall be possible for an authorized Front End to read relevant user
data stored in the UDR.
2\. It shall be possible for an authorized Front End to modify (i.e. create,
update, and delete) relevant user data stored in the UDR.
3\. The UDR shall support notifications to the related Front Ends about
changes of user data which they have subscribed to. Specifically, the UDR
shall allow applications to subscribe to specific events on specific data of
specific users.
4\. The UDR shall support controlled access. Accordingly, UDR shall
authenticate and authorize Application Front Ends.
The authentication shall be based on the identity provided by the FE when
accessing the UDR.
The authorization/access control shall be based on the following criteria:
\- the requested user's network (e.g. PLMN identity)
\- identity provided by the FE
\- application type
\- the user data which are requested
\- the request type (e.g. query, modify)
> NOTE: The UDR derives the application type from the name indicated by the
> FE. If the FE provided the Front End Identifier the UDR can also derive the
> Front End Cluster Identifier(s).
5\. Access to the UDR shall be independent of the structure of the data
models, i.e. the changes in the data models shall not affect these procedures.
6\. It shall be possible to present different views on the user data to the
different FEs which require access.
7\. A group of Front Ends (or a single Front End) for a specific application
type shall be distinguished by a unique Front End cluster identifier.
8\. The UDR may store the current Front End identifier/Front End cluster
identifier(s) when certain user data (e.g. user\'s location, Sh AS
subscription data, service data settings, etc.) is changed as part of the user
data and may use this information to determine which Front Ends should be used
for notifications.
## 5.3 Querying data from the UDR
The Query data procedure is used by an FE to retrieve data from the UDR.
The information flow for the Query data procedure is shown in figure 5.3-1:
Figure 5.3-1: Query data procedure
1\. When an application FE - during processing of its application logic \-
needs to retrieve user data from the UDR it shall issue a Query data request
message and send it over the Ud reference point to the UDR. The message shall
contain:
\- the FE Identifier or the FE Cluster Identifier
\- the user identity\ an identity of the user, e.g. IMSI, MSISDN, IMS public
user identity, IMS private user identity
\- the requested data\ the identification of the data of which the value is
requested
> Data identification and structure shall comply with the requesting FE\'s
> data view.
2\. The UDR shall perform access control to check whether the FE/application
type is allowed to read the requested data. If it is not, an unsuccessful
response shall be returned to the FE and steps 3 and 4 shall be skipped.
3\. If the access control check is successful, the UDR shall fetch the value
of the requested data and format it according to the requesting FE\'s data
view.
4\. The UDR shall return a Query data answer message to the FE. The FE then
shall continue processing its application logic with the retrieved data.
## 5.4 Creating data within the UDR
Create data procedure is used by a FE to insert a new user data record into
the UDR, e.g. when a provisioning FE creates an account for a new user, or
creates a new service profile for an existing user.
The information flow for create data procedure is shown in figure 5.4-1.
Figure 5.4-1 Create Data flow
1\. When an application FE - during processing of its application logic \-
needs to insert new user data in the UDR, e.g. open a new user account in the
database, it shall issue a Create Data Request message and send it over the Ud
reference point to the UDR. The message shall contain:
\- the FE Identifier or the FE Cluster Identifier
\- the user identity\ an identity of the user, e.g. IMSI, MSISDN, IMS public
user identity, IMS private user identity
\- the identification of data to be inserted.
\- the new data value.
2\. The UDR shall perform access control to check whether the FE/application
type is allowed to create the requested data. If it is not, an unsuccessful
response shall be returned to the FE and steps 3 and 4 shall be skipped.
3\. If the access control check is successful, the UDR shall insert the user
data with the new data value.
4\. If the notification triggering conditions are met, the UDR shall perform
notification procedure. This procedure may run before, after or in parallel of
sending Create data answer (see step 5). See section 5.8.
5\. The UDR shall return a Create data answer to the FE. The FE then shall
continue processing its application logic.
## 5.5 Deleting data from the UDR
Delete Data procedure is used by a FE to delete user data stored in the UDR,
e.g. when a provisioning FE deletes a service profile for an existing user, or
removes the account of a user.
The information flow for Delete Data procedure is shown in figure 5.5-1.
Figure 5.5-1 Delete Data flow
1\. When an application FE - during processing of its application logic \-
needs to delete user data from the UDR, e.g. delete user service profile, it
shall issue a Delete Data Request message and send it over the Ud reference
point to the UDR. The message shall contain:
\- the FE Identifier or the FE Cluster Identifier
\- the user identity\ an identity of the user, e.g. IMSI, MSISDN, IMS public
user identity, IMS private user identity
\- the identification of data to be deleted.
The message may contain:
\- the delete condition, if supported by the UDR
2\. The UDR shall perform access control to check whether the FE/application
type is allowed to delete the requested data. If it is not, an unsuccessful
response shall be returned to the FE and steps 3-5 shall be skipped.
3\. If the message contains the delete condition, the UDR shall check if the
delete condition is satisfied. If it is not, an unsuccessful response shall be
returned to the FE and steps 4-6 shall be skipped
4\. If the access control check is successful and the delete condition is
satisfied, the UDR shall delete the requested user data.
5\. If the notification triggering conditions are met, the UDR shall perform
notification procedure. This procedure may run before, after or in parallel of
sending Delete data answer (see step 6). See section 5.8.
6\. The UDR shall return a Delete data answer to the FE. The FE then shall
continue processing its application logic.
## 5.6 Updating data within the UDR
The Update data procedure is used by an application FE to modify user data in
the UDR.
The information flow for the Update data procedure is shown in figure 5.6-1:
Figure 5.6-1: Update data procedure
1\. When an application FE - during processing of its application logic \-
needs to update user data in the UDR it shall issue an Update data request
message and send it over the Ud reference point to the UDR. The message shall
contain:
\- the FE Identifier or the FE Cluster Identifier
\- the user identity\ an identity of the user, e.g. IMSI, MSISDN, IMS public
user identity, IMS private user identity
\- the requested data\ the identification of the data of which the value is to
be updated.
\- the new data value\ value of the data that is to be written in the UDR
The message may contain:
\- the update condition, if supported by the UDR
> Data that is updated may have a complex structure with multiple attributes.
> So the data update achieved through the Update data procedure may comprise
> addition, modification or deletion of some attributes of this data.
>
> Data identification and structure shall comply with the Data view associated
> to the application FE.
2\. The UDR shall perform access control to check whether the FE/application
type is allowed to update the requested data. If it is not, an unsuccessful
response shall be returned to the FE and steps 3-5 shall be skipped.
3\. If the message contains the update condition, the UDR shall check if the
condition is satisfied. If it is not, an unsuccessful response shall be
returned to the FE and steps 4-5 shall be skipped.
4\. If the access control check is successful and the update condition is
satisfied, the UDR shall update the requested data with the new data value. If
the notification triggering conditions are met, the UDR shall perform the
Notification Procedure. This procedure may run before, after or in parallel of
sending Update data answer (see step 5). See section 5.8.
5\. The UDR shall return an Update data answer message to the FE. The FE then
shall continue processing its application logic.
## 5.7 Subscription to Notifications
This procedure is used by FE to perform the subscription/un-subscription to
notification to specific events which occurs on specific user data stored in
the UDR. The events can be changes on existing user data, addition of user
data, and so on. The information flow for the Subscription to Notifications
procedure is shown in figure 5.7-1.
Figure 5.7-1: Subscription procedure
1\. When an FE wants to receive notifications of specific events on specific
user data stored in the UDR, it shall construct a Subscription Request message
and send it over the Ud reference point to the UDR. The message may consist of
the following information:
\- the FE Identifier or the FE Cluster Identifier
\- User identity, e.g. IMSI, MSISDN, IMS public user identity or IMS private
user identity. The User Identity may not be present indicating that the
subscription is applicable to all users in the UDR.
\- Subscription Type
> The Subscription Type indicates whether this request is to subscribe or to
> unsubscribe.
\- Notification Type. It indicates whether this subscription request should
result in a notification to any FE of the application type or cluster
identifier, or in a notification to the FE requesting the notification.
\- Subscription to Notifications information, which consists of:
\- Identification of the requested data
> The Identification of the requested data indicates the data to which
> notifications are subscribed.
\- The notification condition(s)
> The notification condition indicates the specific events on which the
> notification shall be triggered. It shall consist of the addition of the
> requested data, the deletion of the requested data or the changes of the
> requested data.
\- The expiry time
> If the subscription is not permanent, the expiry time indicates the point in
> time when the subscription to notifications expires.
\- The original entity identity
> If the subscription request is related to a UDC external entity (e.g. AS)
> subscription request, this item indicates the original entity which sent the
> subscription request message to the FE in order to subscribe to the
> notification of the specific events of the requested data. The item shall
> contain the address or the name of the original entity.
2\. When receiving a Subscription Request from a specific FE, the UDR shall
perform access control to check whether the FE is allowed to perform the
subscription to the UDR on the requested data. If not, an unsuccessful
response shall be returned to the FE, and steps 3 and 4 are skipped.
3\. The UDR shall store the subscription to notifications information.
4\. The UDR shall return a successful response message to the FE.
NOTE 1: Since Subscription to Notifications information cannot be shared among
different FEs (i.e. a FE cannot read from the UDR subscription information
related to another FE), and for interoperability purposes, careful
consideration is to be taken into account when using subscriptions over Ud.
For example, an application FE could subscribe to notifications about certain
data changes without being aware that another FE was already subscribed for
the purpose of performing the same operations towards the external UDC
entities.
NOTE 2: Applications that require subscribe/unsubscribe to notifications about
many data changes on a per user basis and for common conditions (e.g. HLR/HSS)
can make use of UDR pre-configured subscriptions in order to decrease the
signalling over Ud. See information flows (annex A).
## 5.8 Notification of data modification
### 5.8.1 Description
The Notification procedure shall be used by the UDR to notify an FE about
modification of data, when data in the UDR is added, modified or deleted, and
an FE needs to be informed about this, due to a previous subscription to
notifications procedure (as defined within section 5.7) or due to local
configuration policy in the UDR. No notification should be done towards the FE
at the origin of a data modification or to a FE belonging to the cluster of
the FE at the origin of a data modification.
The information flow for the Notification procedure is shown in figure 5.8-1:
Figure 5.8-1: Notification procedure
1\. The Notification procedure in the UDR is started by the Update data
procedure, the Create procedure, or the Delete procedure; see section 5.6, 5.4
and 5.5 respectively.\ The UDR shall check whether the relevant notification
condition(s) are met. If not met, the following steps shall be skipped and the
procedure terminates.
> NOTE: The conditions based on local configuration policy in the UDR (e.g.
> application type of the FE which performs the create, delete or update
> procedure, presence or absence of other user data) are operator specific and
> out of scope of this specification.
2\. If the notification condition(s) are met the UDR shall select an available
FE that supports the relevant application. If the notification is the result
of a Subscription to Notification procedure, the FE selection shall take into
account the value of the Notification Type information element:
\- If the Notification Type indicates that the notification is to be sent to
the FE requesting the subscription, the UDR shall select the FE that requested
the notification.
\- If the Notification Type indicates that the notification is to be sent to
any FE of the application type or cluster identifier, the UDR shall select an
appropriate FE of the application type or cluster identifier as applicable.
NOTE: Details of the FE selection algorithm can be operator specific and are
out of scope of this specification.
3\. The UDR shall fetch the data that are needed by the FE to perform the
relevant application logic, such as the value of updated data, and may fetch
other additional data based on local configuration policy in the UDR, such as
the previous value of updated data, the original subscribing entity identity,
etc. to construct a notification request message that includes data (in FE
data view).
4\. The UDR shall send the notification request message to the selected FE.
The FE shall perform the relevant application logic.
5\. The FE shall return a response message to the UDR to indicate success or
failure. If no response is received or a failure is indicated, the UDR shall
repeat the procedure starting with step 2 and selecting a different FE.
### 5.8.2 Notifications and transactions
An optional feature allows grouping of notifications associated to the data
changes occurring within a transaction. When this optional feature is
supported, the notifications of data changes associated to a transaction shall
be grouped into one notification procedure to each relevant FE or cluster of
FEs, taking into account the subscriptions to notifications or the local
configuration policies that requested the notifications of the data changes.
The grouping of notifications shall apply independently of those subscriptions
to notifications or local configuration policies that requested the
notifications of the data changes.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Information flows
# A.0 Introduction
The following information flows examples show the possible use of Ud
procedures by application front-ends such as HLR, HSS front-ends when
executing some of their own procedures with the network
# A.1 Information flows with Query data procedure over Ud
## A.1.1 General
When user data (temporary or permanent) has to be fetched, the application
front-end shall perform a query towards the UDR.
The following flows show an example of a terminating call in CS network and an
example of a re-registration procedure in an IMS network. These scenarios do
not address the mechanisms for access authorisation in the UDR. These
scenarios only address the specific actions of traffic events that are
currently in effect.
## A.1.2 CS terminating call information flow example
Figure A.1.2-1: CS terminating call example with Ud Query from HLR-FE
1\. The GMSC initiates MAP Send Routing Info towards the HLR
2\. Upon reception of SRI, the application specific front-end (HLR-FE) fetches
all the user data it needs to perform its application logic (e.g. VLR number,
barring indicators, call forwarding data) from the UDR through a Ud Query
procedure.
3\. After applying the proper access control (i.e. the front-end is allowed to
read that type of data), the UDR responds with the requested user data.
4\. The HLR-FE sends MAP Provide Roaming Number to get a MSRN from the VLR.
NOTE: For simplicity, this example does not show any other procedures that the
HLR-FE can possibly do
5\. If the user is reachable, the VLR provides a MSRN in the response. This
MSRN is not stored in the UDR, since it is temporarily reserved and consumed
in the VLR,
6\. The HLR-FE responds to GMSC with the provided roaming number. No user data
is kept in the front-end after the procedure is ended.
## A.1.3 IMS re-registration information flow example
Figure A.1.3-1: IMS re-registration flow example with Ud Query from HSS-FE
1\. I-CSCF receives an incoming REGISTER request.
2\. The Iâ€‘CSCF sends the Cx-Query/Cx-Select-Pull to the HSS with the Public
User Identity.
3\. Upon reception of Cx-Query, the application specific front-end (HSS-FE)
fetches all the user data it needs to perform its application logic (e.g.
capabilities associated to the user subscription, list of visited networks
allowed, S-CSCF name, etc.) in the UDR through a Ud Query procedure.
4\. After applying the proper access control (i.e. the front-end is allowed to
read the type of data), the UDR responds with data requested (user location,
required capabilities, etc.).
5\. The HSS-FE includes the S-CSCF name in the response. No user data is kept
in the HSS FE.
6\. The I-CSCF sends the REGISTER request to the received S-CSCF.
7\. The S-CSCF sends to HSS Cx-Put/Pull. This request, in this example, is
received by a different HSS-FE.
8\. Upon reception of Cx-Put/Pull, the HSS-FE fetches the user profile, S-CSCF
name, etc. from the UDR through a Ud Query procedure .
9\. After applying the proper access control, the UDR responds with data
requested (e.g. user profile).
10\. The HSS- FE detects that this is a re-registration, so it sends Cx-
Put/Pull Resp to S-CSCF. No user data is kept in the front-end after the
procedure is ended.
11\. The S-CSCF returns 200 OK to I-CSCF
12\. The I-CSCF forwards the response to P-CSCF.
# A.2 Information flows with Updating data procedure over Ud
## A.2.1 General
When user data (temporary or permanent) has to be modified, the application
front-end shall perform an update procedure towards the UDR.
The following flows show an example of a location update in CS network and an
example of a service data update in an IMS network. These scenarios do not
address the mechanisms for access authorisation in the UDR. These scenarios
only address the specific actions of traffic events that are currently in
effect.
## A.2.2 CS location update information flow example
Figure A.2.2-1: CS location update with Ud Update from HLR-FE
1\. The VLR initiates MAP Update Location message towards HLR.
2\. Upon reception of UL, the application specific front-end (HLR-FE) fetches
all the user data it needs to perform its application logic (e.g. barrings,
VLR number, etc.) from the UDR through a Ud query procedure.
3\. After applying the proper access control (i.e. the front-end is allowed to
read that type of data), the UDR responds with the user data requested.
4\. If the request is allowed (e.g. no barring is to be applied), the HLR-FE
sends MAP Insert Subscriber Data to provide the user data to VLR.
5\. The VLR acknowledges the request. _HLR-FE receives the information about
services supported by the new VLR. This can lead to certain additional
modifications on user data._
> 6\. If the previous and new VLR are not the same, the HLR-FE updates the new
> user data (e.g. VLR number) in the UDR through a Ud Update procedure.
NOTE: Step 6 can be done immediately after step 3
7\. If the front-end is allowed to modify the type of data, the UDR updates
the new VLR number.
8\. The HLR-FE sends MAP CANCEL LOCATION to cancel the location in the old
VLR.
9\. The old VLR acknowledges the request and remove all data related.
10\. The HLR-FE informs the new VLR about the result of the Update Location
procedure. No user data is kept in the front-end after the procedure is ended.
NOTE: In this example, by updating the VLR-Number in the UDR after receiving
MAP-Update-Location, the HLR-FE implicitly activates a pre-configured
subscription to notification of relevant Subscriber Data changes. By deleting
the VLR-Number in the UDR after receiving MAP-PurgeMS, a HLR-FE implicitly
deactivates the pre-configured subscription to notification. The presence of a
VLR-Number in the UDR is equivalent to a HLR-FE subscription over Ud for
sending Notification Messages at modification of any relevant Subscriber Data.
## A.2.3 IMS service data change information flow example
Figure A.2.3-1: IMS service data change information flow example with Ud
Update from HSS-FE
1\. UE initiates a service data configuration update (e.g. activates call
waiting) via Ut interface towards the AS.
2\. AS performs Sh-update to store the new service data (i.e. transparent
data) in the HSS.
3\. Upon reception of Sh-Update, the application specific front-end (HSS-FE)
checks the AS permission list. If AS is allowed, the HSS-FE fetches the
service data for the user from the UDR through a Ud Query procedure. These
data include the sequence number to synchronize the writing of data among
different ASs.
4\. If the front-end is allowed to read the type of data, the UDR responds
with service data.
NOTE 1: At this step the HSS-FE can also receive the subscription information
stored for data requested (i.e. list of ASs subscribed to transparent data
changes)
5\. If sequence number is correct, the application specific front-end (HSS-FE)
updates the service data for the user in the UDR through a Ud Update
procedure. The update data request message contains an update condition to
ensure that the data is to be updated if the sequence number was not updated
by other FEs.
6\. If the front-end is allowed to update the type of data and the update
condition is satisfied, the UDR stores the new service data configuration and
the new sequence number
NOTE 2: If the HSS-FE knows from step 4 that no other AS has subscribed to be
notified when transparent data change, the HSS-FE does not send Sh-PNR to any
other AS. If no other AS subscribed to transparent data changes and no other
notifications are required (based on local configuration policy in the UDR),
no Ud Notify is sent.
NOTE 3: It is assumed that the UDR has not allowed to write the transparent
data and sequence number by a HSS-FE during steps 3-6.
7\. The HSS-FE sends the response to Sh-Update to AS. No user data is kept in
the front-end after the procedure is ended.
# A.3 Example Information flows for subscriptions to notifications
## A.3.1 General
When an UDC-external entity subscribes/un-subscribes to notifications of
specific events which occurs on specific user data stored in the UDR, the
application front-end should perform a subscription procedure towards the UDR.
The following flows show examples of an application server subscription to
notification and un-subscription to notification in IMS network. These
scenarios do not address the mechanisms for access authorisation in the UDR.
## A.3.2 Application Server Subscription information flow example
Figure A.3.2-1 Subscription over Sh with Ud subscription from HSS-FE
1\. AS sends the Sh-Subs-Notif request to the HSS-FE to subscribe or un-
subscribe to the notifications of changes on the Repository Data with the
related Public User Identity, the Service Indication, the Application Server
Identity, the Expiry Time (not for un-subscribing) and other information.
2\. Upon reception of the Sh-Subs-Notif request, the HSS-FE checks the AS-
permission list to see whether the AS is allowed to contact the HSS. If so,
the HSS-FE sends the Query Request to the UDR to fetch the user data needed to
process the Sh-Subs-Notify request from the UDR.
3\. After applying the access control, the UDR responds to the HSS-FE with the
requested data.
4\. The FE sends a Subscription Request to the UDR.
The Subscription Request message includes:
\- The Application type of the FE
\- Application FE identity
\- Public User Identity
\- Subscription Type: indicates whether this request is to subscribe or to un-
subscribe.
\- Notification Type
\- the following Subscription-to-Notifications information:
\- Identification of the requested data: Repository Data with Service
Indication.
\- The notification condition: change on user data.
\- The original entity identity: Application Server Identity which issues the
Sh-Subs-Notif request.
\- The expiry time: the Expiry Time in the Sh-Subs-Notif Request, if any
(possibly modified by the HSS-FE); expiry time is not applicable for un-
subscriptions.
  1. The UDR checks whether the subscription/un-subscription is allowed. If it is permitted, the UDR shall store/delete the Subscription-to-Notification information. The UDR responds with the Success Indication.
  2. Upon reception the Subscription Response, the HSS-FE sends the Sh-Subs-Notif Resp to the AS with the value of the requested data and with the result code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
# A.4 Information flows with notification procedure over Ud
## A.4.1 General
When user data (temporary or permanent) has been modified, the application
front-end may require a notification.
When an UDC-external entity modifies subscribable data in the UDR via an
application FE, this application FE shall send notifications to other UDC-
external entities on supported UDC-external interfaces as part of its
application logic (if so required). Notifications to other UDC-external
entities to which this FE is not connected, or to other AS which subscribed to
notifications, require notification on the Ud-Interface.
The following flows show examples of IMS capability change for a user, an
application server subscription to notification and un-subscription to
notification in IMS network. These scenarios do not address the mechanisms for
access authorisation in the UDR. These scenarios only address the specific
actions of traffic events that are currently in effect.
## A.4.2 IMS user capability change with notification information flow example
Figure A.4.2-1: IMS service data change information flow example with Ud
notification towards HSS-FE
1\. The operator changes the capabilities to move the user to a new S-CSCF,
the user is administratively de-registered and S-CSCF is cleared (via
Provisioning FE).
2\. After applying the proper access control (i.e. the front-end is allowed to
write that type of data), the UDR updates the requested data (e.g.
registration status, user capabilities, etc.)
3\. The UDR checks if a FE is required to be notified upon these modified
data. If so, it selects a FE supporting the HSS application and sends a
notification which contains the user data needed by the FE to perform its
application logic (old/new user status, S-CSCF name, etc.)
NOTE 1: The conditions to trigger the notification can be common for all users
and can be based on local configuration policy in the UDR, e.g. a Provisioning
FE modifies user data that is relevant for another application type (HSS) and
other related user data is present (S-CSCF name).
NOTE 2: The FE selection mechanism performed by the UDR (e.g. FE cluster
identity if it was stored at user's registration, application supported, load
balancing, etc.) is out of scope of this specification.
4\. HSS-FE acknowledges the notification.
5\. The user is de-registered from S-CSCF1 by HSS-FE.
6\. S-CSCF1 acknowledges the Cx command.
## A.4.3 Application Server Notification information flow example without Ud-
Notify
Figure A.4.3-1 Notification over Sh without Ud notification
1\. AS1 sends the Sh-Update request to the HSS-FE to update the Repository
Data with the related Public User Identity, the Service Indication, the
Application Server Identity, and other information.
2\. Upon reception of the Sh-Update request, the HSS-FE checks the AS-
permission list to see whether the AS is allowed to contact the HSS. If so the
HSS-FE sends the Query Request to the UDR to fetch the user data needed to
process the Sh-Update request from the UDR.
3\. After applying the access control, the UDR responds to the HSS-FE with the
requested data.
4\. The HSS-FE sends an Update Data Request to the UDR.
  1. The UDR checks whether the update is allowed. If it is permitted, the UDR shall update the repository data. The UDR responds with the Success Indication. Since the update data request was sent by an FE which can contact AS2 and there is no other AS which subscribed to changes in repository data, the UDR does not send Ud-notify.
NOTE: The UDR knows that the FE can contact AS2 based on local configuration
policy
  1. Upon reception the Update Data Response, the HSS-FE sends the Sh-Update Resp to the AS with the result code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
  2. The HSS-FE checks data received in step 3 to see whether an AS has subscribed to notifications (i.e. whether a HSS-FE has previously added/stored an AS in the Application Server Identity List for the Repository Data of the user upon receiving a previous Sh-Subs-Notif). If so the HSS-FE checks the notification conditions. In this example the conditions are met (i.e. AS expiry time stored in the Application Server Identity list has not elapsed) and the HSS-FE sends Sh-Notif to AS2.
  3. AS2 sends Sh-Notif Resp to the HSS FE.
## A.4.4 Application Server Notification information flow example with Ud-
Notify
Figure A.4.4-1 Notification over Sh with Ud notification
1\. OSS sends the Update request to the Provisioning-FE to update the Charging
Information with the related Public User Identity.
2\. Upon reception of the Update request, the Provisioning-FE sends the Query
Request to the UDR to fetch user data from the UDR.
3\. After applying the access control, the UDR responds to the Provisioning-FE
with the requested data.
4\. The Provisioning-FE sends Update Data Request to the UDR to update the
Charging Information.
5\. The UDR checks whether the update is allowed. If it is permitted, the UDR
shall update the charging information. The UDR responds with the Success
Indication.
6\. Upon reception the Update Data Response, the Provisioning-FE sends the
Update Resp to the OSS.
7\. Since an AS has subscribed to notification of update of Charging
Information (i.e. a HSS-FE has previously added/stored an AS in the
Application Server Identity List for the Charging Information of the user upon
receiving Sh-Subs-Notif) and the update data request was sent by an non HSS-FE
(that is, a FE which cannot contact the AS), the UDR selects an HSS-FE and
sends Notify Request to the selected FE.
> The Notify Request includes the following items:
\- Public User Identity.
\- Identification of the requested data: Charging Information.
\- Original data: Original value of the Charging Information before update.
\- Updated data: updated value of the Charging Information.
\- Additional data: the additional information needed by the FE to perform the
Notification procedure in addition to the requested data.
\- The original entity identity: the identity of the Application Server which
issues the Sh-Subs-Notif request.
NOTE: In this example, it is assumed that a pre-configured subscription exists
in the UDR and that a modification to the Charging Information is done by a
non HSS-FE, which results in a notification to an HSS-FE.
> 8\. The HSS-FE checks data received in step 7 to see whether an AS has
> subscribed to notifications on modification on charging information (i.e.
> whether a HSS-FE has previously added/stored an AS in the Application Server
> Identity List for the Charging Information of the user upon receiving a

> FE sends Sh-Notif to the AS.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Applicability of the UDC concept to network
nodes
# B.1 Introduction
**This informative annex outlines a step by step approach which aims to help
clarifying whether a given network node is applicable to the UDC concept.**
# B.2 Basic Prerequisite
**A fundamental concept of UDC is to separate a network node\'s user data from
a network node\'s application logic.**
**It is understood that a network node\'s application logic is running in
sessions, which last for a limited duration. During a session the application
logic makes use of user data, i.e. user data cannot be separated from the
application logic while a session is ongoing. Only when no session is ongoing
user data can be separated from the application logic.**
NOTE: The terms \"session\" and \"application\" in this context have special
meaning which must not be mixed up with a user\'s communication session or
service application.
**Consequently, Network Nodes that (in non-UDC networks) do not store user
data (while no session is ongoing), are not applicable to the UDC concept.**
**Furthermore, Network Nodes that (in non-UDC networks) do not perform
application logic (i.e. pure data bases), are not applicable to the UDC
concept.**
# B.3 Step 1 -- Separating User Data from Application Logic
**In principle, any network node (in non-UDC networks) that stores user data
while no session is ongoing and that performs application logic is a candidate
for separation of user data and application logic:**
{width="6.874305555555556in" height="2.4520833333333334in"}
Figure B.3.1/1: Separating User Data from Application Logic
**However, separating user data from application logic without any additional
steps does not provide much benefit (if any).**
# B.4 Step 2 -- Introducing Provisioning FEs
**If part of the candidate node\'s user data is permanent data which is
applicable to provisioning at that node, provisioning-application logic could
also be separated from the node\'s application logic.**
{width="5.391666666666667in" height="1.5291666666666666in"}
Figure B.4.1/1: Introducing Provisioning FEs
**Again, this step alone does not provide much benefit.**
# B.5 Step 3 - Storing outsourced user data in a logically single UDR
**This step is an essential part of the UDC concept. The outsourced user data
are stored in a logically unique UDR:**
{width="6.129166666666666in" height="2.7909722222222224in"}
Figure B.5.1/1: Storing outsourced user data in a logically single UDR
**One of the benefits of this step is that e.g. Provisioning FE 2 could not
only access via Ud those user data which were separated from the application
logic in Node-FE 2, but also those user data that were separated from the
application logic in Node-FE 1.**
{width="5.391666666666667in" height="2.7909722222222224in"}
Figure B.5.1/2: Storing outsourced user data in a logically single UDR
# B.6 Step 4 --Full Load Sharing and Failover functionality
**What is said for the provisioning FEs in step 3, in theory also holds for
other node-FEs: Node-FE 2 could access via Ud not only its own outsourced
data, but also data sourced out by Node-FE 1. However, careful analysis is
needed before deciding the cases in which \"cross data accessibility\" should
be allowed. The main point to consider is whether or not parallel sessions in
different FEs result in problems.**
**If routing mechanisms used on the network interfaces allow configuration of
alternative routes to address e.g. load sharing, link loss or node outage, and
parallel sessions in different FEs are not regarded a problem, FEs of the same
application type could share load or could take over in cases of node-FE
outage.**
{width="5.391666666666667in" height="3.0284722222222222in"}
Figure B.6.1/1: Full Load Sharing and Failover functionality
**This step does not impact FE or UDR implementation but is a routing
configuration issue outside the UDC. Furthermore, this step -- although it
provides great advantages - is believed not to be essential to the UDC
concept. Deployments may or may not take advantage of this step if applicable.
Non-applicability of this step is not a knock-out criterion for the decision
on applicability of the UDC concept for a given node.**
# B.7 Step 5 -- Converging user data in the UDR
**It is believed to be beneficial when the user data outsourced by several
nodes are not stored separated within the UDR but are somehow converged:**
{width="6.360416666666667in" height="3.2423611111111112in"}
Figure B.7.1/1: Converging user data in the UDR
**This step is purely UDR internal and therefore out of scope of CT4
standards, and not further looked at in this annex.**
# B.8 Example analysis for HLR
> 1\. An HLR (in non-UDC Networks) stores user data (while no session is
> ongoing) and performs application logic, therefore step 1 is applicable.
>
> 2\. An HLR (in non-UDC Networks) stores permanent user data provisioned at
> the HLR, therefore step 2 is applicable.
>
> 3\. Outsourced HLR user data may be stored in a common UDR to allow access
> from any Provisioning-FE connected to the UDR. Step 3 is applicable.
>
> 4\. Parallel sessions in two different HLR-FEs: It is believed that e.g. one
> HLR-FE could process a MAP-SendRoutingInfoForSM message while another HLR-FE
> processes a MAP-AnyTimeInterrogation message for the same user at the same
> time. This in general holds for all HLR-FE session initiating messages.
> Furthermore the duration of an HLR-FE session in general is in the range of
> seconds or minutes rather than hours or days. The transaction mechanism
> supported on the Ud interface is suitable to address data synchronization.
**Step 4 is applicable.**
**In summary all steps are applicable and provide the full benefits of the UDC
concept.**
# B.9 Example analysis for S-CSCF

**Step 4 is not applicable.**
**In summary the applicable steps (1 and 3) do not provide any benefit.**
# B.10 Example analysis for PCRF and SPR
1\. A PCRF (in non-UDC Networks) does not store user data (while no session is
ongoing); on the other hand an SPR does not perform application logic. It
seems that the concept of separating application logic from user data (see
step 1) is already in place.
2\. Also step 2 (direct provisioning of user data in the SPR rather than via
PCRF) seems to be already in place.
3\. Also step 3 (combining several SPRs to a logically unique database) is
applicable.
4\. Parallel sessions in two different PCRFs needs further study.
**Step 4 may not applicable.**
**In summary steps 1, 2, and 3 are applicable and provide some benefits.
Applicability of step 4 may provide further benefits but it is for further
study.**
# B.11 Summary
**Any network entity that performs application logic (in sessions which are
limited in duration) and that stores user data (during the time where no
session is running) is in principle applicable to the UDC concept. However
some nodes may not fully benefit from the UDC concept, especially if**
  * **permanent user data stored at the node - in a non UDC network - is not provisioned at that node**
  * parallel sessions for the same user at the same time cannot run independently
