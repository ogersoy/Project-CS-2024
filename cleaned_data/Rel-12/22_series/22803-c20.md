operator network controlled discovery and communications between UEs that are
in proximity, under continuous network control, and are under 3GPP network
coverage, for:
  1. Commercial/social use
  2. Network offloading
  3. Public Safety
  4. Integration of current infrastructure services, to assure the consistency of the user experience including reachability and mobility aspects
Additionally, the study item will study use cases and identify potential

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Data paths for ProSe Communications
### 4.1.1 Default data path scenario
As currently specified, when two UEs in close proximity communicate with each
other, their data path (user plane) goes via the operator network. The typical
data path for this type of communication is shown in Figure 1, where eNB(s)
and/or GW(s) are involved.
Figure 1: Default data path scenario in the EPS for communication between two
UEs.
### 4.1.2 ProSe Communication scenario
If UEs are in proximity to each other, they may be able to use a \"direct
mode\" or \"locally-routed\" path.
For example, in 3GPP LTE spectrum, the operator can move the data path (user
plane) off the access and core networks onto direct links between the UEs.
This direct data path is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: The \"direct mode\" data path in the EPS for communication between
two UEs.
Note: Two eNBs are shown here for illustration.
Another example is when the data path is locally-routed via the eNB(s). This
locally-routed data path is shown in Figure 3:
Figure 3: A \"locally-routed\" data path in the EPS for communication between
two UEs when UEs are served by the same eNBs.
## 4.2 Control paths for ProSe Communication
For the ProSe Communication scenarios depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 3 in
clause 4.1, several control path scenarios may apply. The following text and
figures provide examples of potential control paths for different situations,
understanding that other 3GPP Working Groups are responsible for defining the
specific control paths associated with ProSe.
When the UEs involved in the ProSe Communication are served by the same eNB
and network coverage is available, the system can decide to perform ProSe
Communication using control information exchanged between the UE, eNB and the
EPC (e.g., session management, authorization, security) as shown by the solid
arrows in Figure 4. For charging, signalling modifications should be minimized
with respect to the existing architecture. The UEs can in addition exchange
control signalling via the ProSe Communication path as shown by the dashed
arrow in Figure 4.
Figure 4: Example control path for network-supported ProSe communication for
UEs served by the same eNB.
When the UEs involved in the ProSe Communication are served by different eNBs
and network coverage is available, the system can decide to perform ProSe
Communication using control information exchanged between the UE, eNB and the
EPC (e.g., session management, authorization, security) as shown by the solid
arrows in Figure 5. In this configuration, the eNBs may coordinate with each
other through the EPC or communicate directly for radio resource management as
shown by the dashed arrow between the eNBs in Figure 5. For charging,
signalling modifications should be minimized with respect to the existing
architecture. The UEs can in addition exchange control signalling via the
ProSe Communication path as shown by the dashed arrow between UE1 and UE2 in
Figure 5.
Figure 5: Example control path for network-supported ProSe Communication for
UEs served by different eNBs.
If network coverage is available to a subset of the UEs, one or more Public
Safety UEs may relay the radio resource management control information for
other UEs that do not have network coverage.
If network coverage is not available, the control path can exist directly
between Public Safety UEs, as shown with the solid arrow in Figure 6. In this
configuration, the Public Safety UEs can rely on pre-configured radio
resources to establish and maintain the ProSe Communication. Alternatively, a
Public Safety **_Radio Resource Management Function, which can reside in a
Public Safety UE,_** can manage the allocation of radio resources for Public
Safety ProSe Communication as shown with the dashed arrows in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Example control path for Public Safety ProSe Communication for UEs
without network support.
## 4.3 Public Safety use of ProSe
In the United States, LTE has been selected by the FCC as the technology
[2][3][4] for the Public Safety Network. In Europe, there is an ongoing
discussion on spectrum to be chosen for broadband Public Safety held by CEPT
ECC WG FM PT 49 [8]. Additionally, a variety of Public Safety over ProSe
requirements have been defined [5][6][7]. The requirements raise the following
points for consideration in developing the ProSe requirements for Public
Safety use.
A Public Safety UE can operate in Public Safety spectrum for Public Safety
service and in MNO commercial spectrum, for general service (e.g. voice call),
however, only Public Safety spectrum is used for Public Safety ProSe.
Public Safety UEs using ProSe communicate with each other even though they
belong to different HPLMNs.
A Public Safety UE can automatically use ProSe when E-UTRAN coverage is not
available, or the user can manually set the UE to use direct discovery and
communication even when E-UTRAN coverage is available.
In addition, the following assumptions are made for Public Safety ProSe:
  * All Public Safety users utilize ProSe-enabled UEs
  * ProSe supports both UE discovery and UE Communication
If and when other regional and/or regulatory requirements are raised, they
will be taken into account.
# 5 Use Cases and Scenarios
## 5.1 General Use Cases
### 5.1.1 Restricted ProSe Discovery Use Case
#### 5.1.1.1 Description
This use case describes a basic scenario for ProSe Discovery that can be used
for any application. A social networking application is used as an example to
illustrate this use case.
#### 5.1.1.2 Pre-Conditions
An operator offers a service which makes use of the ProSe feature, in which:
\- A ProSe-enabled UE of a given user is able to discover and be discoverable
by the ProSe-enabled UEs of his/her friends;
\- A social networking application is enabled to use this ProSe feature.
Mary, Peter and John use a given social networking application. In the context
of this application, the following relationships are established:
\- Mary and John are friends;
\- John and Peter are friends;
\- Mary and Peter are _not_ friends;
\- There might be hundreds of other ProSe-enabled UEs in the vicinity of Mary
using the same or other applications.
In addition, the following assumptions are made:
\- Mary, Peter and John use ProSe-enabled UEs;
\- Mary, Peter and John are subscribed to the same cellular operator;
\- Mary, Peter and John are currently residing on their HPLMN;
\- Mary, Peter and John are subscribed to an operator service that allows them
to use ProSe;
\- Mary has given permission to John to discover her and vice versa;
\- John has given permission to Peter to discover him and vice versa.
The social networking application used by Mary, Peter and John is enabled by
the operator to benefit from ProSe.
#### 5.1.1.3 Service Flows
Mary decides to look for a friend via her application, and so do John and
Peter. Thus (e.g. following interaction with her application), as Mary's UE
comes into proximity of John's and Peter's UEs, the user experience is such
that, without any further user interaction with the device:
\- Mary's UE detects (for example using direct radio signals or via the
operator's network) that John's UE is in its proximity;
\- John's UE detects that Mary's UE is in its proximity;
\- Mary's social networking application learns that John is in or out of her
proximity;
\- John's social networking application learns that Mary and Peter are in or
out of his proximity;
\- Mary's UE does not detect that Peter's UE is in its proximity;
\- Peter's UE does not detect that Mary's UE is in its proximity;
\- Mary's social networking application does not detect that Peter is in or
out of her proximity;
\- Peter's social networking application does not detect that Mary is in or
out of his proximity.
As the social network application of Mary detects that John is in her
proximity, Mary may decide to transfer data to John via the social networking
application.
ProSe Discovery is achievable without any location information.

third-party application developers for application development. Benefiting
from the cooperation between the operator and third-party application
developers, the user can download and use a rich variety of new ProSe
applications created by third-party application developers.
If the third-party application developer wants to use Prose capability
features to develop a new application, the third-party application developer
may need to sign a contract with the operator at first. The contract may
include a third-party application developer ID, the application ID and so on.
The operator will store the contracted information of this third-party
application developer in their network. The third-party application developer
develops new ProSe applications using the ProSe APIs.
Users receive the ProSe applications created by the third-party application
developers from various application distribution channels, e.g. an Operator
application distributor or App Store.
When the user activates the application, the application will request access
to ProSe capability features. At operator defined intervals, the operator's
network interacts with the ProSe-enabled UE to identify, authenticate,
authorize, charge and enable ProSe capability features.
In order to reduce the interaction frequency between the operator'network and
the ProSe-enabled UE, the frequency of this interaction should be considered
and may be per operator-configuration of the UE.

# 7 Conclusion and recommendations
The Feasibility Study for Proximity Services (ProSe) Technical Report analyses
several use cases of ProSe for both general and public safety use. The use
cases address two key aspects of ProSe:
  * Discovery, and
  * Communication via an optimized path.
Taking into consideration the Use Cases and Scenarios defined in Clause 5, new
potential requirements related to UE operations, network operations, charging
and security for ProSe have been identified in Clause 5 with additional
potential requirements in Clauses 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.
It is recommended to proceed with normative work.
Some aspects in this feasibility study have led to normative specification in
TS 22.278 [10] and TS 22.115 [11]. The text of the present document will not
be updated to align with normative specifications.
###### ### Annex A: WLAN handling in ProSe
**Discovery:**
Discovery of ProSe-enabled UEs is only based on E-UTRA radio.
**Communication:**
a) UEs may use E-UTRA for communication
b) UEs may also use WLAN for communication
The WLAN communication has no impact on specifications under responsibility of
RAN WGs. The 3GPP EPC may provide configuration that includes parameters to be
used for setting up WLAN communication.
Use cases that include EPC management of the WLAN session and those that cover
use of WLAN without EPC management can be considered.
