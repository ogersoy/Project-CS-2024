# 6 E-UTRA RF requirements for UE
## 6.1 Transmitter Characteristics
CA_2-2 operates at 1850-1910 MHz for UL and 1930-1990 MHz for DL. Assuming UE
transmitting in the whole range of 1850-1910 MHz, the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order of
harmonics, 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 5^th^, and 7^th^ order IMD are calculated and shown
in the Table 6.1.1-1.
Table 6.1.1-1: CA_2-2 UL harmonics and IMD
* * *
Harmonics and IMD Frequency range in MHz Falling into RX band? 2^nd^ harmonics
3700 \~ 3820 No 3^rd^ harmonics 5550 \~ 5730 No 2^nd^ order IMD (f1-f2) -60 \~
60 No 3^rd^ order IMD (2f1-f2) 1790 \~ 1970 Yes 5^th^ order IMD (3f1-2f2) 1730
\~ 2030 Yes 5^th^ order IMD (4f1-f2) 5490 \~ 5790 No 7^th^ order IMD (4f1-3f2)
1670 \~ 2090 Yes 7^th^ order IMD (5f1-2f2) 5430 \~ 5850 No
* * *
The UE RX band is 1930\~1990 MHz. From the above table, it can be seen that
the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics do not fall into the UE receive band.
However, the 3^rd^, 5^th^, and 7^th^ order IMD components overlap with the UE
RX band. So, there are certain IMD issues for intra-band non-contiguous CA_2
UE. However, note that, for CA specific intermodulation products, more than
one aggregated carrier is required.
There is no harmonics and IMD issue for intra-band non-contiguous CA_2 UE
which supports 1UL.
## 6.2 Receiver Characteristics
### 6.2.1 PCC and SCC arrangements in intra-band NC CA
In Figure 6.2.1-1, we present two different possible options for PCC and SCC
allocations for 2DL intra-band NC CA. In case (a), PCC is allocated on the
lower part of the spectrum. In this case, the DL SCC is located even further
compared to DL PCC with respect to UL PCC, thus, no additional REFSENS
requirements apply here, and REFENS requirements on both DL SCC and DL PCC
follow the specifications as described in Table 7.3.1-1 of TS36.101.
In case (b), the frequency separation between UL PCC and DL SCC is lower than
specified UL-DL frequency separation as of Table 5.7.4-1 of TS36.101, thus,
additional REFSENS requirement apply for DL SCC in this case, which are
discussed in Table 1 of this contribution for CA_2A-2A. Note that, REFSENS
requirements for DL PCC are similar to single UL case, i.e. the REFSENS
requirement follows Table 7.3.1-1 of TS36.101.

contiguous CA
### 6.2.2 UL PCC allocations and REFSENS relaxations
Duplex gap for band 2 is 20 MHz which is also the smallest separation distance
of own PCC UL and SCC DL in Case(b) from Figure 6.2.1-1.
Following intra-band non-contiguous CA uplink configuration for reference
sensitivity for CA_2A-2A when one UL is being configured is proposed to be
specified.

# 7 E-UTRA RF requirements for BS
## 7.1 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/2 DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 2 non-contiguous DL carriers can be calculated as shown
in Table 7.1-1 below:
Table 7.1-1: Band 2 non-contiguous DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 1930 1990
2^nd^ harmonics frequency limits (MHz) 3860 3980 3^rd^ harmonics frequency
limits (MHz) 5790 5970
2^nd^ order IMD products (f-low -- f-high) (f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) -60 60
3^rd^ order IMD products (2*f-low --f-high) (2*f-high --f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) 1870 2050
* * *
It can be seen from Table 7.1-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics as well as
the 2^nd^ IMD products of BS transmitting non-contiguous carriers in Band 2 do
not fall into the BS receive band of any operating band, while the 3^rd^ IMD
products of BS supporting non-contiguous carrier aggregation of Band 2 may
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and
39. Note that the calculation in Table 7.1-1 assumes the BS is transmitting
with the whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band 2.
Assume that the 2 non-contiguous CC transmitted by the Band 2 BS are _a_ and
_b_ MHz channel bandwidth and _c_ and _d_ MHz from the edges of Band 2 DL
frequency band as shown in Figure 7.1-1 below:
{width="6.690277777777778in" height="1.1215277777777777in"}
Figure 7.1-1: Non-contiguous CC transmitted by the Band 2 BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 7.1-2 below:
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="1.1006944444444444in"}
Figure 7.1-2: Non-contiguous CC received by the Band 2 BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 2 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 7.1-2 below:
Table 7.1-2: Band 2 BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
3^rd^ order IMD products IMD frequency limits (MHz) (2*f1-low -- f2-high) 1870
+ 2*_c_ \+ _d_ (2*f1-high -- f2-low) 1870 + 2*_c_ \+ _d_ \+ 2*_a_ \+ _b_
(2*f2-low -- f1-high) 2050 -- 2*_d_ \-- _c_ \-- 2*_b_ \-- _a_ (2*f2-high --
f1-low) 2050 -- 2*_d_ \-- _c_ (f1-low -- f2-high + f2-low) 1930 + _c_ \-- _b_
(f1-high + f2-high -- f2-low) 1930 + _c_ \+ _b_ \+ _a_ (f2-low -- f1-high +
f1-low) 1990 -- _d_ \-- _a_ \-- _b_ (f2-high + f1-high -- f1-low) 1990 -- _d_
\+ _a_
* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 7.1-2 with the BS receive blocks
in Figure 7.1-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in
the BS by transmitting of the 2 CC will only fall into the BS own receive
blocks of Band 2 under one of the transmit configurations shown in Table 7.1-3
below (note that _a_ and _b_ can only be 5, 10, 15 or 20 as stated in the
WIDS):
Table 7.1-3: Band 2 BS transmit configurations with 3^rd^ IMD within Band 2 BS
own receive blocks

_c_ \+ _d_ \< 20 10 5 5 \< _c_ \+ _d_ \< 20 5 15 0 \< _c_ \+ _d_ \< 20 10 10 0

_c_ \+ _d_ \< 20 20 20 _c_ \+ _d_ \< 20
* * *
Note that Bands 1, 33, 34 and 39 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Band 2. Moreover, co-location of Band 2 transmitter and
Band 35, 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-location on adjacent
frequencies which requires the use of certain site-engineering solutions to
avoid mutual interference. Consequently, the focus here will be on the 3^rd^
order IMD products falling into Bands 2, 23 and 25.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the Band 2 BS transmit filter and the Band 2, 23 or 25 BS
receive filter would not be able to provide substantial attenuation to reduce
the IMD interference generated within the Band 2, 23 or 25 BS receive band to
well below the receiver noise floor to prevent receiver desensitization, as
there is not a large frequency gap between Band 2 DL and Band 2, 23 or 25 UL.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band 2 BS transmitters supporting non-
contiguous CA should not share the same antenna with other Band 2, 23 or 25 BS
receiver, or the own Band 2 BS receiver if the BS transmit configurations
shown in Table 8.1-3 are used, in order to not to cause Band 2, 23 or 25 BS
receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
