# 4 Study of E-UTRA requirements
## 4.1 Operating bands and channel bandwidths
### 4.1.1 Operating bands for CA
E-UTRA CA for Band 3 is defined to operate in the entire Band 3 range, as
defined in Table 4.1.1-1.

### 4.1.2 Channel bandwidths for CA
Table 4.1.2-1 defines the supported E-UTRA bandwidths for intra-band non-
contiguous CA in Band 3. As shown, only 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz component
carrier channel bandwidths are proposed to be supported in Band 3 carrier
aggregation.

### 4.1.3 UL harmonics and IMD
CA_3 operates at 1710\~1785 MHz for UL and 1805\~1880 MHz for DL. Assuming UE
transmitting in the whole range of 1710\~1785 MHz, the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order
of harmonics, 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 5^th^, and 7^th^ order IMD are calculated and
shown in table 4.1.3-1.
Table 4.1.3-1: CA_3 UL harmonics and IMD
* * *
Harmonics and IMD Frequency range in MHz Falling into RX band? 2^nd^ harmonics
3420\~ 3570 No 3^rd^ harmonics 5130\~ 5355 No 2^nd^ order IMD -75\~ 75 No
3^rd^ order IMD 1635\~ 1860 Yes 5^th^ order IMD 1560\~ 1935 Yes 7^th^ order
IMD 1485\~ 2010 Yes
* * *
The UE RX band is 1805\~1880 MHz. From the above table it can be seen that the
2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and the 2^nd^ order IMD do not overlap with
the UE RX band, but the 3^rd^ order IMD in 1635\~1860 MHz, the 5^th^ order IMD
in 1560\~1935 MHz, and the 7^th^ order IMD in 1485\~2010 MHz overlap with the
UE RX band.
The two CC can be 5, 10, 15, or 20 MHz, and they are located within 1805\~1880
MHz in TX. The following two figures are copied from [4] and used in this
study. It is assumed that the 1^st^ CC and 2^nd^ CC bandwidths are _a_ MHz and
_b_ MHz, respectively. The distance from the 1^st^ CC to the lower band edge
is _c_ MHz, and the distance from the 2^nd^ CC to the higher band edge is _d_
MHz. In this study, not only the IMD caused by two tones is considered, but
also the IMD caused by more than two tones.

**[The 3^rd^ order IMD]{.underline}**
The 3^rd^ order IMD, which are caused by the CA_3 UE transmitting these two
CCs and may overlap with the RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz, are calculated and
captured in table 4.1.3-2.

Whenever the 3^rd^ order IMD falls into its own RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz, it
causes interference to RF front-end. It may or may not fall into its own RX
channels, the 1^st^ CC and the 2^nd^ CC. The following table provides the _c_
and _d_ values, corresponding to the 1^st^ CC and the 2^nd^ CC locations,
which generate IMD falling into its own RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz.

its RX band, 1805\~1880 MHz

* * *
From the above results, it can be seen that whenever _c_ and _d_ meet "_c_
+2*_d_ \< 55 MHz", the 3^rd^ order IMD falls into its own RX band of
1805\~1880 MHz.
Whenever the 3^rd^ order IMD falls into its own RX channels, the 1^st^ CC
and/or the 2^nd^ CC, it is the worst case scenario. The following table
provides the _c_ and _d_ values, corresponding to the 1^st^ CC and 2^nd^ CC
locations, which generate IMD falling into its own RX channel of the 1^st^ CC
(27.5-_a_ -_b_ \<_c_ +_d_ \<27.5). The 3^rd^ order IMD does not falls into its
own RX channel of the 2^nd^ CC.
Table 4.1.3-4: CA_3 UL configurations with the 3^rd^ order IMD falling into
its RX channel -- the 1^st^ CC in 1805\~1880 MHz

The 1^st^ CC bandwidth (_a_ in MHz) The 2^nd^ CC bandwidth (_b_ in MHz) CC
positions (_c_ and _d_ in MHz) 5 5 17.5 \< _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 5 10 12.5 \< _c_
+_d_ \< 27.5 5 15 7.5 \< _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 5 20 2.5 \< _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 10 5
12.5 \< _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 10 10 7.5 \< _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 10 15 2.5 \< _c_ +_d_
\< 27.5 10 20 _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 15 5 7.5 \< _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 15 10 2.5 \< _c_
+_d_ \< 27.5 15 15 _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 15 20 _c_ +_d_ \< 27.5 20 5 2.5 \< _c_

27.5
* * *
From the above results, it can be seen that whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the
condition of 27.5-_a_ -_b_ \<_c_ +_d_ \<27.5, which detail is listed in Table
4.1.3-4, the 3^rd^ order IMD falls into its own RX channel of the 1^st^ CC in
1805\~1880 MHz. The 3^rd^ order IMD does not fall into its own RX channel of
the 2^nd^ CC.
**[The 5^th^ order IMD]{.underline}**
The 5^th^ order IMD, which are caused by the CA_3 UE transmitting these two
CCs in Figure 4.1.3-1 and may overlap with the RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz, are
calculated and captured in the following table.

causes interference to RF front-end. It may or may not fall into its own RX
channels, the 1^st^ CC and the 2^nd^ CC. The following table provides the _c_

which generate the 5^th^ order IMD falling into its own RX band of 1805\~1880
MHz.

From the above results, it can be seen that whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the
conditions listed in Table 4.1.3-6, the 5^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX
band of 1805\~1880 MHz.
Whenever the 5^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX channels, the 1^st^ CC
and/or the 2^nd^ CC, it not only generates interference to its RF front-end,
but also to its own RX channels. The following two tables provide the _c_ and
_d_ values, corresponding to the 1^st^ CC and 2^nd^ CC locations, which
generate IMD falling into its own RX channel of the 1^st^ CC and the 2^nd^ CC,
respectively.

From the above results, it can be seen that whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the
conditions listed in Table 4.1.3-7, the 5^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX
channel of the 1^st^ CC in 1805\~1880 MHz. Whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the
conditions listed in Table 4.1.3-8, the 5^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX
channel of the 2^nd^ CC in 1805\~1880 MHz.
**[The 7^th^ order IMD]{.underline}**
The 7^th^ order IMD, which are caused by the CA_3 UE transmitting these two

Whenever the 7^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz, it
causes interference to RF front-end. It may or may not fall into its own RX
channels, the 1^st^ CC and the 2^nd^ CC. The following table provides the _c_
and _d_ values, corresponding to the 1^st^ CC and the 2^nd^ CC locations,
which generate the 7^th^ order IMD falling into its own RX band of 1805\~1880
MHz.

From the above results, it can be seen that whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the
conditions listed in Table 4.1.3-10, the 7^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX
band of 1805\~1880 MHz.
Whenever the 7^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX channels, the 1^st^ CC
and/or the 2^nd^ CC, it not only generates interference to its RF front-end,
but also to its own RX channels. The following two tables provide the _c_ and
_d_ values, corresponding to the 1^st^ CC and 2^nd^ CC locations, which
generate IMD falling into its own RX channel of the 1^st^ CC and the 2^nd^ CC,
respectively.

From the above results, it can be seen that whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the
conditions listed in Table 4.1.3-11, the 7^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX
channel of the 1^st^ CC in 1805\~1880 MHz. Whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the
conditions listed in Table 4.1.3-12, the 7^th^ order IMD falls into its own RX
channel of the 2^nd^ CC in 1805\~1880 MHz.
Based on the above study, the following conclusions are reached.
1\. The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics, and the 2^nd^ order IMD of a UE which
supports 2CC do not fall into its own RX band range in 1805\~1880 MHz. The
3^rd^, 5^th^, and 7^th^ order IMD may fall into its own RX band range
depending on the locations of the 1^st^ CC and 2^nd^ CC.
2\. Whenever _c_ and _d_ meet "**_c_ +2*_d_ \< 55 MHz**", the 3^rd^ order IMD
falls into its own RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz.
3\. Whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the conditions listed in **Table 4.1.3-4** , the
3^rd^ order IMD falls into its own RX channel of the 1^st^ CC in 1805\~1880
MHz. The 3^rd^ order IMD does not fall into its own RX channel of the 2^nd^
CC.
4\. Whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the conditions listed in **Table 4.1.3-6** ,
**Table 4.1.3-7** , and **Table 4.1.3-8** the 5^th^ order IMD falls into its
own RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz, into its own RX channel of the 1^st^ CC in
1805\~1880 MHz, and into its own RX channel of the 2^nd^ CC in 1805\~1880 MHz,
respectively.
5\. Whenever _c_ and _d_ meet the conditions listed in **Table 4.1.3-10** ,
**Table 4.1.3-11** , and **Table 4.1.3-12** the 7^th^ order IMD falls into its
own RX band of 1805\~1880 MHz, into its own RX channel of the 1^st^ CC in
1805\~1880 MHz, and into its own RX channel of the 2^nd^ CC in 1805\~1880 MHz,
respectively.
## 4.2 Supporting intra-band CA with 1 CC UL
It is proposed to support the case of a UE capable of 2 CC on the DL and 1 CC
on the UL
### 4.2.1 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/2 DL
The 2nd and 3rd order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Operating band 3 non-contiguous DL carriers can be calculated
as shown in Table 4.2.2-1 below:
Table 4.2.2-1: Operating band 3 non-contiguous DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 1805 1880 2nd harmonics
frequency limits (MHz) 3610 3760 3rd harmonics frequency limits (MHz) 5415
5640 2nd order IMD products (f-low -- f-high) (f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) -75 75 3rd order IMD products (2*f-low --f-high) (2*f-high
--f-low) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 1730 1955
* * *
It can be seen from table 4.2.2-1 that the second order harmonics and inter-
modulation products from Operating band 3 DL transmit will fall inside
Operating band 43. It can also be seen that no other Operating band is
affected by these products. No Operating band is affected by the third order
harmonics, whereas the third order inter-modulation products from a BS
supporting NC_CA in operating band 3 may fall inside the receive part of
Operating bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 25, 33, 35, 36 37, and 39\. Note that the
limits in table 4.2.2-1 are calculated assuming maximum possible spacing
between the aggregated carriers in the Operating band.
