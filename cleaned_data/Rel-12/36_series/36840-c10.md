# 4 Background
In June 2012 Brazil released licenses in the bands 2.6 GHz and 450 MHz. In
particular, at 450 MHz the band plan allocation is the following: uplink
451-458 MHz and downlink 461-468 MHz. The entire block (7+7 MHz) has been
assigned to a single operator, while different operators have been assigned
the band in different states (differentiation on geographical area).
Currently, 3GPP specifications does not cover 450 MHz band. It was approved in
RAN#57 to open a new WI in RAN4 to specify LTE to operate in the 450 MHz band
taking into account the band plan indicated above.
As part of the work item, suitable band arrangement such as duplex gap and
Rx/Tx separation assumptions need to be identified for this new band and
requirements will be developed based on the findings of this activity.
## 4.1 Work item objective
The objective of the present work item is to specify technical requirements
for deploying LTE operation in 450 MHz band in Brazil. It is composed of the
following work tasks:
a) Core RF requirements for RAN4 specifications
b) Performance requirements for RAN4 specifications
c) Conformance testing in RAN5 specifications (to follow)
# 5 Band plan allocation and regulatory background
The Brazilian Agency of Telecommunications, ANATEL, approved Resolution 558
[3] on December 20, 2010 defining the Regulation of Channelization and
Conditions of Use of Spectrum in the 450 -- 470 MHz band. Under this
regulation, the 450 -- 470 MHz band will be cleared and allocated to deliver
fixed and mobile services, including the full range of IMT services nationwide
in Brazil. Incumbent users of the 450 -- 470 MHz frequency bands will be
migrated to an alternative spectrum band, to avoid interference and to
facilitate Brazil's goal in providing coverage to its low population density
areas. The 7+7 MHz spectrum 451 -- 458 / 461 -- 468 MHz is allocated on a
primary, non-exclusive basis for personal mobile service (SMP), fixed switched
telephony service (STFC), as well as multimedia communication services (SCM).
The frequency plan pre-and post-restructuring are shown below in Figure 5-1.
{width="6.631944444444445in" height="4.186111111111111in"}
Figure 5-1: 450 - 470 MHz spectrum plan in Brazil
It can be seen that there are a number of services operating in adjacent
spectrum as well as within the spectrum under consideration.
Current regulatory rules at Brazil provide the basis for establishing the
requirements for coexistence analysis within 450-470 MHz band, with focus on
adjacent services to 451-458/461-468 MHz sub-bands. The rules are defined in
terms of channel characteristics, such as width, spacing, nominal center
frequency, output or effective radiated power and some antenna issues, are
defined in the Frequency Band Channelization and Usage Conditions regulations,
as shown in table Table 5-1.
Table 5-1: Frequency band channelization and usage conditions regulations
related to the 450-470 MHz band

NOTE: The SARC service frequency allocation changes are established in [3],
but the complete frequency usage and power limits are specified in [4].
The out-of-band interference characteristics, such as transmission mask, out-
of-band spurious emissions and maximum output power, are defined in the
Product Certification Requirements regulations, in clause 5.5.
## 5.1 In-band services
According to current regulation [3], 451-458 MHz / 461-468 MHz sub-bands are
allotted for SMP, STFC and SCM services. Any antenna polarization and azimuth
pattern for sector coverage can be applied, as well any arrangement of them.
When a sectorized system is adopted in locations with more than 100,000
inhabitants the sector shall be limited to 120 degrees.
Within the band are Private Limited Service (SLP) from 451.5875 -- 454 MHz and
456.5875 -- 459 MHz for use in airports as primary service without
exclusivity. For the protection of these services, the regulations require an
exclusion zone of 10 km within the location of the airport. However, in
accordance with [3], it is possible to establish coordination agreements.
Within the band are also Maritime Mobile Services (SMM) occupying sub-bands
457.5 -- 457.6 MHz and 467.5 \-- 467.6 MHz. The regulations require that new
operations within the band engage in prior coordination with operators of
these SMM services to address coexistence. Thus, in all of these cases of in-
band services, the regulations require that coexistence is achieved by
deployment and coordination methods rather than by establishing emission
limits. STFC and SCM are normally licensed to the same operator as SMP with
differences related to services provided to public or private regime with
differnig levels of obligations, fees, and rates. The usage and coordination
of these three classes of service are controlled by the operator itself.
_Thus, coexistence with in-band services will not be treated by 3GPP
specifications_.
## 5.2 Broadcast auxiliary service (SARC)
As described in Article 5 and Article 8 of [3], the sub-bands 450 -- 451 MHz
and 460 -- 461 MHz are allocated to Broadcast Auxiliary Service (SARC). These
services are governed by [4], [5], and [6], and apply to Electronic news
gathering, internal dispatch, studio-transmitter link, remote-control and
telemetering at Brazil.
According to [3] and [4], these services are operated in 12.5 or 25 kHz
channels, with frequency modulation. The channel spacing and nominal carrier
frequencies are defined by equations below
> f~N~ (MHz) = [(N x 0.025) + 450], N = 1 to 40
>
> f~N~ (MHz) = [(N x 0.025) + 460], N = 1 to 40
The maximum output power is summarized in table 5.2-1
Table 5.2-1: Maximum output power allowed for SARC transmitter
* * *
Frequency Range Maximum transmitted power (W) Maximum e.i.r.p. (dBm)  
Fixed station Mobile station Fixed station Mobile station Subrange E (450 --
451 MHz) 20 20 61 54 Subrange F (460 -- 461 MHz) 20 20 61 54
* * *
Note that [5] refers to subrange F as 455 -- 456 MHz, but this has been
subsequently reallocated to 460 -- 461 MHz. Duplex direction is not specified
so it can be assumed that either direction (uplink or downlink) is permitted
in either of these frequency ranges. The modulation characteristics of the
transmitter, applicable to both fixed and mobile stations, are required as
follows
a) audio response (with pre-emphasis of 75 or 50 us)
a.1) when using a 25 KHz channel: + 2 dB between 300 and 3000 Hz (reference
1000 Hz);
a.2) when using two channels of 25 kHz: + 1.5 dB between 30 Hz and 10 000
(reference 1000 Hz);
b) level of harmonics and spurious: attenuated at least 60 dB relative to the
fundamental;
c) harmonic distortion:
c.1) when using a 25 KHz channel: less than 10%;
c.2) when using two channels of 25 KHz: less than 2%;
d) FM noise output below 100% modulation across the audio frequency range;
d.1) when using a 25 KHz channel: a minimum of 40 dB (reference 400 Hz);
d.2) when using two channels of 25 kHz: 50 dB minimum (reference 400 Hz);
e) Frequency tolerance: 0.002%.
Aside from FM de-emphasis, no receiver requirements such as blocking or
adjacent channel rejection requirements are mandated.
## 5.3 Private mobile limited service (SLMP) and Private Limited service
(SLP/SLE)
As described in Article 4 in the resolution of [3], the sub-bands 458 \-- 459
MHz for uplink (mobile transmit) and 468 -- 469 MHz downlink (basestation
transmit) are allocated to Private Mobile Limited Service (SLMP), consisting
of channel numbers 1 -- 80.
As described in Article 6 in the resolution of [3], the sub-band 459 \-- 460
MHz for uplink (mobile transmit) and 469 -- 470 MHz downlink (basestation
transmit) are allocated to Private Limited Service (SLP) and Specialized
Limited Service (SLE), consisting of channel numbers 81 \-- 160.
The channels can be aggregated or not, and in any case the transmission
carrier must be positioned at the center of the aggregated channel. There is
no constraint on the number of aggregated channels. There is no mention in the
regulation about changes on spurious specifications when channels are
aggregated. Thus, we assume that the same emission attenuation and frequency
offset requirements of Table 5.3-2 apply regardless of aggregation.
The private limited services (SLMP, SLP, SLE) operating in the 458 -- 460 MHz
and 468 -- 470 MHz should limit their input power to the antenna according to
the following
Table 5.3-1: Maximum output power allowed for SLMP, SLP, SLE transmitter
* * *
Station Power at antenna (Watts) Basestation 250 Fixed or mobile terminal 25
* * *
These services are operated in 12.5 kHz channels, which can be aggregated. The
emission mask for 12.5 kHz systems for both basestation and mobile operating
in 400 MHz band is given in [7] as

* * *
P is the transmitter power in Watt.
No receiver requirements such as blocking or adjacent channel rejection
requirements are mandated. Furthermore, no constraints on antenna polarization
and azimuth pattern are specified.
## 5.4 Adjacent services to 450-470 MHz band
In current Brazilian regulatory scenario, adjacent services to 450-470 MHz
band are also recommended to be in the scope of coexistence analysis. Indeed,
TS 36141 considers in-band blocking in a frequency range up to 20 MHz around
the channels.
The 470-490 MHz sub-band is the first 20 MHz of the 470-806 MHz band, which is
currently designated by ANATEL to UHF TV service. The coexistence between LTE
broadband service in 450 MHz band and the UHF TV service can be evaluated
taking into account the requirements specified in Resolutions 498 [10] and 284
[11].
Even though the 430-450 MHz band should be considered for coexistence
analysis, the 430-440 MHz band is allotted by ANATEL for Amateur Radio
Service. However, the occupation of the 430-440 MHz band is quite sparse at
Brazil and the interference probability of this service on 450 MHz band is
very low. Thus, the proposal is to focus on the coexistence analysis of
440-450 MHz band, considering adjacent services STFC, SMP, SME and SMC, as per
table 5.4-1, based on the requirements already detailed in previous clauses.

{width="5.839583333333334in" height="2.4555555555555557in"}
## 5.5 Product Certification Requirements regulations
Regulations are established for product certification without regard to
specific band usage, for example in 361/2004. Such regulations typically
include spurious emissions, frequency stability, and other equipment
characteristics. There is also an output power limitation in the case that the
specific frequency band regulation does not define it. Both the product
certification requirements as well as the frequency specific requirements, for
example in 558/2010. If the requirements conflict, it is expected that the
certification authority (OCD - \"Designated Certification Body\") would make a
decision possibly consulting ANATEL.
Table 5.5-1 shows the regulation documents to be considered for evaluating
potential interference among services, based on currently Product
Certification Requirements for services related to 450-470 MHz band, as per
ANATEL. Table 5.5-2 describes the most relevant requirements defined in such
regulations, for the purpose of coexistence analysis.

Figure7.1-1 shows the LTE 450 spectrum and other system spectrum around 450
MHz in Brazil. When considering the LTE deployment it is needed to study the
interference issues from adjacent systems, such as SARC, SLMP, SLP/SLE and
analog TV (ATV) or digital TV (DTV) system.

### 7.1.1 UE
To evaluate the coexistence requirements for UE\'s operating in the proposed
LTE 450 MHz band, we consider the impact of adjacent systems to receiver
performance and transmitter performance. For the receiver, we consider
transmitters in adjacent bands whose power may cause receiver blocking and
whose out-of-band emissions may fall into the receive band increasing the
noise floor. For the transmitter, we consider the out-of-band emissions
generated which may fall in-band into the adjacent band\'s receiver. One
method to evaluate these conditions is to observe the regulatory requirements
for systems operating in adjacent bands. The regulatory requirements provide a
worst-case bound on the adjacent systems transmitter power, out-of-band
emissions, as well as provide limits on the allowable transmission power and
out-of-band emissions from the device operating in the 450 MHz band. This
method is useful for worst case analysis when studied in conjunction with a
deterministic approach on minimum coupling loss between aggressor and
transmitter. However, such a method is often overly pessimistic with respect
to actual operation.
In this case, we take a glance at the coexistence requirement implied by such
a method. The regulatory requirements of greatest consequence are those for
the system operating immediately adjacent to the proposed LTE 450 band. For
this case, the UE filter is not able to provide any attenuation. As summarized
in [1] and [2] the regulations in Brazil allow a broadcast auxiliary service
(SARC) to operate in sub-bands 450 - 451 MHz and 460 - 461 MHz, immediately
adjacent to the 451 - 458 MHz / 461 - 468 MHz band authorized for mobile
broadband. There is no guardband and since the duplex direction is not
specified, either of the sub-bands can be transmit or receive.
#### 7.1.1.1 Transmitter
In the case that the lower sub-band at 450 - 451 MHz is used for receive by
portable or mobile devices, there is potential interference from UE\'s
transmitting in the LTE 450 band. We note, however, that there is no
regulatory requirement specified for out-of-band transmissions from the LTE
450 band. Therefore, as a working assumption, we propose that the standard
3GPP requirements on UE emissions (ACLR and general SEM) are sufficient for
the UE operating in the LTE 450 band. We further propose that power class 3 is
appropriate for such a UE.
**Proposal 1: The LTE 450 UE should be a power class 3 device with 23 dBm
maximum output power.\ The tolerance is [+2]/[-2] pending investigation of the
UE PA and duplexer.**
**Proposal 2: The conventional 3GPP requirements on UE emissions (ACLR,
general SEM, and spurious emissions) are suitable for the UE operating in the
LTE 450 band. No additional requirements are imposed to offer protection to
services operating in adjacent or nearby spectrum.**
#### 7.1.1.2 Receiver
The UE receive side is potentially more challenging. In the case that there is
SARC operation in the upper sub-band at 460 - 461 MHz with portable or mobile
device transmission, the impact to the UE receiver at 460 - 461 MHz must be
considered. We first consider the out-of-band emissions from the SARC mobile
station transmitter. The regulations indicate that the level of harmonics and
spurious emissions must be attenuated by at least 60 dB compared to the
fundamental. The maximum output power of the mobile SARC transmitter is no
higher than 20 watts as limited by the regulations. Conducting the MCL
analysis with this upper bound, the emissions due to the ACLR from the SARC
mobile station can greatly increase the noise floor of the UE receiver
operating in the LTE 450 MHz band depending on the physical separation between
devices. For example, at a physical separation of 100 meters, the noise rise
in the receiver in the adjacent channel can still be as high as 14.5 dB
assuming free space path loss.
However, since the bandwidth of the SARC transmission signal is narrow (25
kHz), it can be expected that the emissions will decay quickly as the
frequency separation is increased. That is, if the LTE channel is shifted to
provide offset to the SARC transmit channel, the impact due to emissions
falling in-band can be reduced. The amount of offset needed for a given MCL
and in-band noise rise requires further study and understanding of the
emission characteristics of the SARC transmitter beyond that which is
available in the regulations. This would require a non-trivial study of
emission characteristics for these systems. Furthermore, increasing the
frequency separation by shifting the location of the LTE450 channel may have
other detrimental impacts, such as self-desense, which may make this
possibility undesirable from a deployment perspective.
The other aspect to consider is the UE receiver blocking. The 3GPP ACS and in-
band blocking specifications provide guidance to the minimum guaranteed
performance from the UE. For both of these specifications, a certain
degradation to reference sensitivity is allowed in the presence of a jammer;
for example, 14 dB reference sensitivity degradation is allowed for ACS case 1
and 6 dB degradation is allowed for in-band blocking. Even with the allowed
degradation, the MCL is required to be very large to comply with standard UE
receiver blocking requirements. The dominant interference cases appear to be
ACS case 1 and in-band blocking. For example, at a physical separation of 100
meters, an additional 28 to 33 dB of coupling loss is required to meet the
minimum performance requirement. For these cases, further frequency separation
between the SARC transmitter and the LTE 450 UE receiver may not be as
beneficial since the range of available frequency separation is limited by the
7 MHz passband and further limited by the objective to place a 5 MHz channel
in the band. Thus, receiver blocking may be the dominant factor even if the
ACLR noise from the SARC transmitter can be mitigated by frequency separation.
In addition to the blocking effect of the SARC transmitter located at 460 -
461 MHz, there is an impact due to intermodulation between the LTE 450
transmission and this jammer in the duplex gap. The 3rd order intermodulation
term between the two is likely to fall within the receive band and desense the
receiver. Note that the power levels which may be possibly observed here are
much higher than those specified for the intermodulation requirement in the UE
specification.
From the above discussion, it is apparent that a conventional worst-case
deterministic analysis leads to results which are not able to be met by the UE
and are therefore of limited value. An alternative approach could be to
consider a statistical analysis where the characteristics of the aggressor and
victim systems are taken into account. For example, the SARC system is
predominantly used for electronic news gathering (ENG) type services where it
is expected that the setup and usage of the system in any particular area is
temporary. Furthermore, the ENG mobile transmitters are generally mounted on
vans with a telescoping antenna aimed to a distant receiver and may not
necessarily be transmitting at the maximum power allowed by the regulations.
Thus, the probability of interference is greatly reduced since the events
occur infrequently on a temporary basis in a localized area, the antenna is
mounted on a tall mast, and the pattern is highly directional. Furthermore, in
the case that there is severe interference, the network may be able handoff
the UE to another frequency band if it is available, or may simply be able to
accept the risk of outage to a subset of UE\'s in adverse radio conditions. If
such considerations were to be taken into account, it is easy to see that the
overall impact to the LTE network is much less severe than the deterministic
worst-case analysis might suggest. The challenge in conducting such a
statistical analysis, however, is to ability to gather the appropriate
information regarding the operational parameters to construct a network
simulation. In any event, it is expected that the receiver noise rise,
intermod, and blocking challenges cannot be resolved by adjusting the receiver
specifications, but rather by network deployment, handoff when available,
and/or by accepting the risk of temporary outage for a subset of UE\'s
subjected to strong interference.
**Proposal 3: 3GPP UE receiver specifications will not be adjusted to
specifically address the receiver coexistence with services in adjacent bands
(SARC, SLP/SLE, SLMP).**
#### 7.1.1.3 UE coexistence with UHF TV broadcast
UE coexistence with UHF broadcast TV merits consideration due to the close
frequency proximity between the two services. As indicated in [12], there are
four possible interference scenarios to evaluate associated with TV
interfering with LTE service and vice versa, with respect to the basestation
and to the UE. This can be visualized in Figure 7.1.1.3-1 from [12], which is
copied below for convenience.

separated from the upper edge of the downlink band for LTE 450. The next
channel is separated by 8 MHz.
We consider three aspects in this analysis. First, we consider the emissions
from the UE transmitting in the uplink for the LTE 450 band falling into the
TV band and potentially disrupting TV reception. Second, we consider the out-
of-band emissions from the TV broadcast falling into the downlink of the LTE
450 band. Lastly, we consider the blocking effect of the TV broadcast on the
LTE 450 receiver.
##### 7.1.1.3.1 UE emissions
The first aspect to consider is the UE unwanted emissions falling into the TV
band. To determine this value, there are many methods of analyses which can be
performed. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we instead refer to the
extensive studies which were performed to address a similar concern of
interference to TV reception at 700 MHz for Band 28 and Band 44\. In that
case, the studies were done within the Asia Pacific Telecommunity in the APT
Wireless Group with participation from device vendors, infra-structure
vendors, TV receiver manufacturers, government regulators, network operators,
and others. The conclusion of this study [13], by consensus, was a
recommendation that the UE emissions should be limited to -34 dBm/MHz over the
TV band, scaled to the TV bandwidth. This level of protection was concluded to
be appropriate to protect TV reception also considering the technical and
economic factors associated with UE equipment. Subsequently, 3GPP adopted this
recommendation in setting the UE emission requirements to -26.2 dBm/6 MHz and
-25 dBm/8 MHz for Band 28 and Band 44, respectively.
However, we note that the propogation characteristics at 700 MHz differ from
those at 450 MHz by approximately 3.8dB. Therefore, we revise the limit in
order to maintain the same level of interference at the TV receiver as derived
from the APT study for the same separation distance. Performing this
adjustment, the emission level becomes -30 dBm/6 MHz.
Having established the target emission level required to protect broadcast TV
reception, we must ensure that the LTE 450 UE is able to comply and define
restrictions in transmit power and/or uplink allocation if needed. For the LTE
450 band, we are considering channel bandwidths of up to 5 MHz with uplink in
the range from 451 -- 458 MHz. While the exact frequencies for the band have
not yet been agreed, it can be seen that there is at least 12 MHz separation
from the edge of the uplink channel to the closest TV channel. For a 5 MHz
channel bandwidth, at this separation, the emissions are governed by the
spurious domain where the limit in accordance with the ITU-R recommendation is
-36 dBm/100 kHz. Scaling this value yields an emission limit of -18 dBm/6 MHz.
Thus, in order to comply with the target emission limit of -30 dBm/6 MHz, the
UE duplexing filter must provide at least 12 dB rejection at this offset.
Fortunately, we expect that the UE filter can readily provide this level of
rejection.
##### 7.1.1.3.2 TV broadcast emissions
The second aspect to consider is the out-of-band emissions from the TV
broadcast falling into the LTE 450 UE receive band. The regulatory limits for
digital broadcast TV are summarized in Table 3 of [12] and illustrated in
Figure 7.1.1.3.2-1, copied here for convenience, for the worst case scenario
of non-critical mask with class A transmission power (8 kW ERP) located in the
nearest TV channel. Interpreting the points on this curve as ERP levels per 6
MHz, the noise profile is estimated pointwise from the curve as shown in the
table 7.1.1.3.2-1.
Table 7.1.1.3.2-1: Noise profile
* * *
Frequency (MHz) TV OOBE ERP (dBm/6 MHz) 467.5 9 466.5 1 465.5 -8 464.5 -12
463.5 -14
* * *
The averaged value of noise within the downlink from 463 -- 468 MHz is
approximately -5 dBm/MHz at the TV broadcast antenna.
{width="4.874305555555556in" height="3.154166666666667in"}
Figure 7.1.1.3.2-1: Class A DTV station transmission mask
To limit the degradation of reference sensitivity to 3dB, the required
isolation is approximately 100 dB, disregarding antenna gain and hand and head
loss. According to the path loss propogation model presented in [12] derived
from ITU-R recommendation P-1546-1, the required separation distance from the
UE to the TV broadcast tower is approximately 1 km.
In practice, emissions from TV broadcasters can be much better than the
regulations require. Specifically, it may be possible to install sharper
transmit filters at the broadcast station to further reduce the out-of-band
emissions. In such a case, the minimum separation distance can be reduced.
##### 7.1.1.3.3 UE blocking
The last aspect to consider is the impact of UE blocking due to the high power
TV broadcast in the adjacent channel. It can be seen in Figure 7.1.1.3.3-1
that the pertinent parameters to consider are the ACS and in-band blocking
when evaluating the impact of the two nearest TV channels.
Figure 7.1.1.3.3-1: Relationship of TV channels to LTE 450 Rx band
For the same scenario as described above, with 100 dB isolation, the power
received at the UE is approximately -31 dBm. According to the UE minimum
performance specification for adjacent channel selectivity, the UE will be
highly desensed in the presence of such a strong interfering signal. Thus, it
is the UE ACS and blocking rather than the TV broadcast out-of-band emissions
that is likely to be the limiting factor in determining UE performance in the
presence of Channel 14 broadcast. This is especially true if the out-of-band
emissions from the TV broadcast outperform the regulatory mask. The case 2 ACS
specification indicates that a UE which receives an adjacent interfering
signal as high as -25 dBm requires the desired LTE signal to be received at
-56.5 dBm, which is approximately 40 dB above reference sensitivity. For case
1 ACS, the interfering signal may be tolerated at a level of approximately -51
dBm with a desense of 14 dB. In this case, the additional isolation required
is 20 dB resulting in a path of 6.6 km.
For the blocking interference from Channel 15 broadcast, it is anticipated
that the UE Rx filter will be able to provide rejection. Initial feedback from
a filter vendor suggests that 15 - 25 dB rejection is available when averaged
over Channel 15. Furthermore, the Channel 15 broadcast is in the region
between case 1 and case 2 in-band blocking where the tolerance to interference
is much higher than ACS. In this case, the separation can be reduced to less
than 1 km depending on the filter performance. Greater than 40 dB filter
attenuation is expected for Channel 16, so this channel can be disregarded.
For specific installations such as CPE with rooftop-mounted antennas, the
minimum separation distance may be larger as shown in [12]. For those cases,
the rooftop mounted antenna may be able to provide significant antenna gain (8
dBi) and if evaluated against the in-band blocking case 1 requirement of -56
dBm, the required separation was reported to be 27.4 km. However, in these
cases, the antenna is in a fixed location and is directional, so interference
mitigation can be more easily achieved by exploiting directionality.
Additional filtering may also be possible on an external rooftop mount.
The problem of UE blocking can be partially mitigated by several methods. The
first is to assume that actual UE devices will have better ACS and blocking
performance than dictated by the minimum performance specification. Indeed,
this may be the case, especially under nominal conditions, though it cannot be
guaranteed. However, these are implementation-specific aspects which are
outside of the scope of 3GPP. A second approach is to rely on attenuation from
the Rx filter in the UE. In the worst case, the filter can not guarantee any
attenuation at 2 MHz offset. Thus, attenuation of a TV signal on Channel 14
cannot be guaranteed. However, meaningful attenuation can be achieved in
Channel 15 and beyond. Lastly, exclusion zones and increased basestation
deployment in locations of strong Channel 14 interference may be an option in
specific deployment scenarios to improve the signal-to-inteference ratio.
We note that the situation described here bears similarity to other scenarios
previously considered in 3GPP. For example, in the US 700 MHz bands a high
power DTV broadcast centered at 725 MHz is potentially an interfering signal
to the downlink of Bands 12 and 17. For the case of Band 12, the edge-to-edge
separation is 1 MHz which is similar to the situation here. The solution for
Band 12 was to rely upon deployment techniques, exclusion zones, and to accept
the risk of interference and outage under worst case conditions rather than to
specify an ACS requirement on the UE. Such a requirement would have been
inconsistent with the Rx linearity requirement for any other band and so it
was concluded that other deployment techniques to address the problem would be
preferable. For Band 17, an increased separation is available so that the UE
filter can provide attenuation. This is similar to the Channel 15 scenario
described here. As another example, in Europe, the uppermost TV broadcast
channel extends to 790 MHz, which is also only 1 MHz separated from the
downlink of Band 20, yet there is no explicit additional UE blocking
requirement since the problem is addressed otherwise in deployment.
##### 7.1.1.3.4 Proposal
We propose that no supplementary specifications for emissions, ACS, or
blocking be defined for the LTE 450 UE to address coexistence with UHF TV
broadcast. The analysis in this paper has shown that UE emissions into the TV
band will be well controlled and that out-of-band and blocking interference
from adjacent TV channel 14 may require specific site deployment solutions
and/or that the operator accept an increased risk of outage in worst case
conditions. Adding requirements to the specification that can be met with
existing state-of-the-art technology will not change this situation since the
worst case can be quite severe. On the other hand, adding new requirements
which do not fully address the coexistence condition in the worst case may
also imply that additional site solutions or other techniques are not needed.
We note that a similar approach has been adopted for other bands with similar
circumstances. Therefore, in light of the timeline and obligation for
deployment of this Band for LTE in Brazil, the limited value that additional
requirements would provide, and the possibility of misinterpretation of adding
new requirements which do not fully resolve the worst case coexistence
condition, we propose that no new requirements be specified by 3GPP for the
purpose of UE coexistence with TV and that in the case that problems are
experienced, that they be resolved by site specific deployment solutions.
### 7.1.2 BS aspects
#### 7.1.2.1 BS Coexistence with TV system
The lower edge of UHF-TV band is 2MHz above the DL band and 12 MHz above the
UL band. The following interference scenarios which may impact BS requirements
are considered:
● ATV Transmitter  LTE BS Receiver (Blocking)
● DTV Transmitter  LTE BS Receiver (Blocking)
● LTE BS OOBE  TV Receiver
The analysis on LTE450 BS coexistence with TV system is presented in Annex
A.1. From the investigation we can find that:
The rejection from LTE450 towards its own DL, may help for co-existence
between UHF-TV and LTE450, assuming a large rejection (about 90dB) from LTE450
UL to LTE450 DL. No additional blocking requirement is proposed for BS
receiver.
Physical separation is required between the BS and the TV receiver to avoid
interference. The distance is dependent on the attenuation from the BS
duplexer. Since currently there is no regulatory requirement on OOBE for LTE
BS coexistence with TV system, it is proposed not to define additional
emission requirements for BS transmitter in 3GPP specification.
#### 7.1.2.2 BS Coexistence with SARC system
Within 450\~470 MHz, SARC service can work in the range of 450\~451 MHz or
460\~461 MHz, which is adjacent to the low edge of LTE 450 band, and duplexer
direction is not specified. The following interference scenarios need to be
considered:
● SARC OOBE  LTE BS Receiver
● SARC TX Power  LTE BS Receiver (Blocking)
● LTE BS OOBE  SARC receiver
According to Clause 5.2, no receiver requirements such as blocking or adjacent
channel rejection requirements are mandated for SARC systems. To perform the
interference analysis from LTE BS to SARC systems receiver, some assumptions
for SARC systems such as noise figure and allowed desensitization are made.
##### 7.1.2.2.1 SARC OOBE  LTE BS Receiver
The interference analysis for SARC OOBE to LTE450 BS receiver is shown in
table 7.1.2.2.1-1. The allowed interference power in LTE RX channel is -108
dBm/5MHz with 1 dB desense. According to clause 5.2 in, the spurious
attenuation of SARC service is 60 dBc, using 25 kHz channel as example, the
accumulated emission power in 5 MHz is 6 dBm. Hence required connector to
connector coupling loss is 114 dB.

The blocking analysis for SARC transmit power to LTE450 BS is shown in table
7.1.2.2.2-1. The narrow-band blocking requirement for LTE is -49 dBm for 6 dB
desense and -60 dBm for 1 dB desense. The maximum SARC transmit power is 43
dBm. Hence the required coupling loss is 103 dB for protection of BS blocking.

##### 7.1.2.2.3 LTE OOBE  SARC receiver
The interference analysis for LTE OOBE to SARC receiver is shown in table

interference power is -131 dBm/25kHz for 1 dB desense. Using LTE ACLR = 45
dBc, the LTE BS emission within 25 kHz is -25 dBm. Then the rrequired
connector to connector coupling loss is 106 dB.

##### 7.1.2.2.3 Conclusion
For SARC operated in the frequency range of 450-451MHz, thanks to the
isolation of LTE BS duplexer, the LTE OOBE to SARC receiver can be reduced
significantly and the coexistence is achievable for practical deployment.
While the sub-band is just adjacent to LTE450 UL band and there is no guard
band, the interference from SARC transmitter to LTE450 BS receiver needs
further consideration in deployment.
For SARC operated in the frequency range of 460-461MHz, which is at least 2
MHz from LTE450 BS receiver, the BS may provide some additional attenuation
and reduce the blocking power from SARC service. While the sub-band is just
adjacent to LTE450 DL band and there is no guard band, some mitigation
techniques such as distance separation and site engineering are needed to
provide needed isolation for the case LTE BS interference to SARC service.
Due to the SARC systems are point-to-point services with highly directional
antenna and are distributed rarely, it is expected that the co-existence
between SARC systems and LTE450 can be achieved by deployment and coordination
methods. Therefore, it is proposed that no additional requirement to be
defined for BS transmitter and BS receiver to address the coexistence with
SARC service.
#### 7.1.2.3 BS Coexistence with the limited services (SLMP, SLP, SLE)
The limited services (SLMP, SLP, SLE) are operating in 458 -- 460 MHz for
downlink and 468 -- 470 MHz for uplink, which is adjacent to LTE450 band. The
following interference scenarios need to be considered:
● Limited service BS OOBE  LTE BS Receiver
● Limited service BS transmitter  LTE BS Receiver (Blocking)
● LTE BS OOBE  Limited service BS Receiver
● Limited service terminal OOBE  LTE BS Receiver
● Limited service terminal transmitter  LTE BS Receiver (Blocking)
● LTE OOBE  Limited service terminal Receiver
According to Clause 5.3 in [5], no receiver requirements such as blocking or
adjacent channel rejection requirements are mandated for the limited service.
To perform the interference analysis from LTE BS to the limited service
receiver, some assumptions for the limited service such as noise figure and
allowed desensitization are made.
##### 7.1.2.3.1 Limited service BS OOBE  LTE BS Receiver
The BS emission interference from the limited services to LTE BS receiver is
shown in Table 7.1.2.3.1-1. The allowed interference power in LTE RX channel
is -108 dBm/5MHz with 1 dB desense. According to ANATEL regulation 554, the

5 MHz is 10 dBm. The required connector to connector coupling loss is 118 dB.

-49 dBm for 6 dB desense and -60 dBm for 1 dB desense. The maximum transmit
power of the limited service is 54 dBm. If the BS duplexer rejects its own
transmitted signal by 90dB, 114-90=24 dB coupling loss is needed.

equal to 5 dB (we assume the same as for LTE BS), the allowed interference
power is -134 dBm/12.5kHz for 1 dB desense. Using LTE ACLR = 45 dBc, the LTE
BS emission within 12.5 kHz is -28 dBm, and then required connector to
connector coupling loss is 106 dB. The uplink frequency of the limited service
is in the region of transition between LTE450 TX and RX, the duplexer can
provide some attenuation which will help for co-existence in some degree for
LTE450 BS OOBE to limited service receiver.

##### 7.1.2.3.7 Conclusion
From the investigation above, for LTE BS transmitter, the uplink frequency of
the limited service is in the region of transition between LTE TX and RX, and
the duplexer may provide some attenuation. While the downlink band of LTE450
is just adjacent to the downlink band of the limited service, the BS
transmitter may cause potential interference to the terminal receiver of the
limited service. However, since there is no regulatory requirement on unwanted
emission for LTE BS coexistence with the limited service, it is proposed not
to define additional emission requirements for BS transmitter in 3GPP
specification. For LTE BS receiver, the attenuation of duplexer may help for
co-existence. While the uplink band of LTE450 is just adjacent to the uplink
band of the limited service, the terminal of the limited service may cause
potential interference to the LTE450 BS receiver. Some mitigation techniques
such as site engineering may be used to alleviate coexistence.
## 7.2 Frequency band arrangement
### 7.2.1 Consideration on BS implementation
#### 7.2.1.1 Inter-modulation
According the band allocation in Brazil, TX--RX frequency separation is 10MHz,
which may be the smallest one among the current 3GPP bands. And it is
important to consider the inter-modulation impact to the receiver from own TX.
It is found that when the bandwidth of transmitted carrier(s) is 5MHz, 5^th^
order inter-modulation other than 3^rd^ order inter-modulation product will
fallen into own receiver channel. To avoid IM3 interference, it is proposed
that the bandwidth of transmitted carrier(s) is not larger than 5 MHz, i.e.
some multi-carrier cases which may cause IM3 interference are not recommended,
such as 3MHz+3MHz, 5MHz+1.4MHz.
Figure 7.2.1.1-1: 3^rd^ order and 5^th^ order inter-modulation
#### 7.2.1.2 BS duplexer
The narrow gap and high rejection are the main issues. All the filter
characteristics shown are examples only and do not preclude other
implementations.
A possible filter is shown in Figure 7.2.1.2-1, considering a 9 order cavity
filter with 3000 un-loaded Q value, The BS TX filter is larger than 105 dB
attenuation at the RX band.
{width="6.3909722222222225in" height="2.91875in"}
Figure 7.2.1.2-1: 9 order BS TX filter evaluation
Taking into account the temperature and manufacturing margin, the insertion
loss at 461 MHz is about 3.3 dB, and the insertion loss at 468 MHz is about
2.7 dB. The large insertion loss in the edge will cause heat sink problem and
need larger size.
For the Rx to Tx rejection, considering the output power is 43 dBm, and the
blocking requirement for LTE is -43 dBm, then the rejection requirement for
the Rx filter is at least 86 dB. In the simulation, 90dB limit is assumed.
Considering a 9 order cavity filter with 3000 un-loaded Q value, Figure
7.2.1.2-2 gives the evaluation of the BS RX filter.

Figure 7.2.1.2-2: 9 order BS Rx filter evaluation
Taking into account the temperature and manufacturing margin, the insertion
loss at 451 MHz is about 2.2 dB, and the insertion loss at 458 MHz is about
2.7 dB. The large insertion loss in the edge will cause sensitivity
degradation.
### 7.2.2 Band arrangement
ITU has identified 10 recommended frequency arrangements to implement the IMT
systems in the frequency range 450-470 MHz as shown in Table 7.2.2-1.
Following the ITU and CITEL recommendations [15], the arrangement of D10 is

frequency range of 451\~468 MHz, there are 4 sub-bands defined in the CDMA
band class 5 which are sub-band A, B, H, and I [14]. Among those 4 sub-bands,
sub-band A is currently being widely deployed in the world and more than 80%
of CDMA450 networks worldwide adopted the CDMA450 sub-band A. CDMA450 sub-band
A is consistent with ITU frequency arrangement D4 as described above.
The 450MHz bands offer the significant advantages of reduced propagation loss
and improved indoor penetration due to its low frequency nature, which are
highly valued by the spectrum owner and administrators. In order to maximize
ecosystem for 450MHz band in Brazil, the band arrangement for LTE450 is
proposed to be compatible with the existing CDMA450 sub-band A.
The 450-470 MHz would be a challengeable band comparing with existing bands. .
From UE performance perspective, it is highly beneficial to restrict the
transmit bandwidth as 5MHz or smaller. It was also shown in [16] that at least
5MHz duplex gap is desired. Band arrangement was also discussed in other
contributions, such as [17]. Alternatives increasing the 10 MHz Tx/Rx duplex
spacing can reduce the required Tx-Rx isolation and allow an increase in
uplink RB allocation. However, it is incompatible with the CDMA450 sub-band A
and inconsistent with the channelization provided in current regulations for
this band in Brazil [3].
Based on the analysis above, the band arrangement in Table 7.2.2-2 is adopted
for LTE450 band in Brazil:

## 8.1 UE duplexer
From [R12-WP5D-C-0290!!-E], following ITU and CITEL recommendations, the D10
frequency arrangement of Recommendation ITU-R M.1036-4 (451-458 MHz uplink,
461-468 MHz downlink) is being considered in Brazil as shown in Table 8.1-1.

{width="6.85in" height="0.5770833333333333in"}
From [R4-132021], however, a modified D4 arrangement was proposed as a
starting point for LTE450 operation in Brazil in order to specify the BS and
UE requirements as shown below in Table 8.1-2

This proposed LTE450 band is similar but not identical to CDMA band class 5
sub-bands A which is based on ITU D4 band arrangements. Therefore, in our
analysis, we have evaluated the performance of a CDMA band class 5 sub-band
duplexer(s) in order to determine the expected duplexer performance which can
be used to determine the RX and TX performance for LTE450 UE. Duplexer
simulation results for LTE band [31] are also provided.
### 8.1.1 CDMA band class 5 sub-band duplexer Performance Summary
In order to determine reasonable SAW duplexer performance parameters for use
in further analysis data sheets from two 450MHz sub-band A SAW vendors were
examined. The vendors are labelled A and B

## 8.2 UE transmitter requirements
### 8.2.1 Maximum output power
We anticipate that the LTE 450 UE will be a class 3 device with maximum output
power +23 dBm ± 2dB. Maximum output power is a critical parameter considering
the intended use of this band for rural coverage. A higher power CPE device is
out-of-scope of this work item. For UL-MIMO, we assume the same output power
requirements as for other bands can also be met in this band if UL-MIMO is
supported in the device.
## 8.3 UE receiver requirements
### 8.3.1 Self interference only aspects
The ITU/CITEL D10 frequency arrangement will be extremely challenging to
provide the necessary TX-RX duplexer isolation so as to avoid receiver self
interference **due to the small duplex gap and reduced TX-RX spacing
(10MHz).**
**In this clause we look at the impact of full RB and partial RB allocated to
UL transmitter** assuming the D10 frequency arrangement with two values of TX
--RX isolation. In our analysis we considered the Tx /Rx configuration as
shown in Figure 8.3.1-1.
{width="3.7805555555555554in" height="2.717361111111111in"}
Figure 8.3.1-1: Tx -- Rx configuration
Assumptions;

\- Full resource block (RB) allocation is being received in the DL as per RAN4

\- TX RB allocation starting from worst channel edge in the UL as per RAN4

10-15dB (CPE/ WLL)
\- Desense is referenced to RX main antenna port only
a) **Full RB allocation for 3MHz (maximum 15 RB) and 5MHz (maximum 25 RB)
channel bandwidth**
Figure 8.3.1-2 shows the TX--RX duplexer isolation needed for main receiver
for the allowed maximum UL transmission configuration for 3/5MHz channel
bandwidth.

Figure 8.3.1-2: channel bandwidth / Duplex TX-RX isolation / Rx self desense
These results for the required TX -RX duplex isolation are summarized in Table
8.3.1-1 for the receiver 1dB and 3dB desense case
Table 8.3.1-1: TX -RX Duplex isolation
{width="6.508333333333334in" height="0.8659722222222223in"}
This analysis only considers the impact on the main RX~1~ port. Results,
taking into account the RX~2~ diversity port, will be expected to be better,
however, the improvement in a real deployment may be limited by the smaller
isolation (6dB) for TX --RX~2~ (diversity port) due to hand and body coupling.
In the case of a fixed device or CPE/WLL deployment we could expect to see
much larger isolation for the TX --RX~2~ (diversity port) due to the larger
form factor and lack of hand/body coupling effects.
Our studies have considered both a CDMA 450MHz sub-band A duplexer filter
which can provide a 45-50dB of TX-RX isolation and a CDMA 450MHz ceramic
duplexer filter which is able to offer an 80dB+ value of TX-RX isolation. The
ceramic filter due to its larger size would be more applicable for a large
size fixed CPE/ WLL type terminal implementation but has the benefit meeting
the required TX-RX isolation needed to minimize self interference for full RB
allocation.
Figure 8.3.1-3 shows the typical noise ingress assuming A CDMA sub-band A SAW
duplex filter (50dB TX-RX isolation) and a ceramic duplexer (80dB of TX-RX
isolation) for 3/5MHz channel bandwidth operation. The TX operation band is
452.5-457.5MHz and the RX band is 462.5-467.5MHz is shown below
{width="6.291666666666667in" height="2.0833333333333335in"}
Figure 8.3.1-3: Example CMA 450 sub-band-A SAW and a Ceramic duplexer for 5MHz
b) **Partial UL RB allocation for 3MHz and 5 MHz channel bandwidth operation**
In the case of a SAW filter implementation, if the transmitted configuration
is reduced by limiting the number of UL resource blocks (RB) then the TX noise
and OOBE into the RX band will be expected to decrease.
Table 8.3.1-2 shows the large reduction in RB allocation needed to meet a 1dB
desense criteria for the RX sensitivity assuming 50 dB of TX -- RX duplex
isolation for a TX- RX spacing of 10 MHz
Table 8.3.1-2: UL configuration for RFSENS with TX- RX spacing of 10 MHz
* * *
Channel bandwidth Maximum UL (RB) Partial UL RB allocation (RB) for 1 dB
desense 3MHz 15 [6] RB 5MHz 25 [5] RB
* * *
This indicates that partial [5/6] RB allocation can be used to mitigate the
effect of sub-optimum TX-RX isolation to limit the desense impact on the
receiver sensitivity but would mean a reduction in the UL peak throughput at
the cell edge for a SAW duplexer implementation
The above analysis is only focused on the self interference due to duplexer
performance limitation. However, it is worth noting that there are other UE
impairments such as IP2, phase noise reciprocal mixing, etc which need to be
considered in deriving the UE receiver sensitivity.
To minimize the impact of Tx noise on reference sensitivity, the uplink
configuration is reduced when the duplex separation is small. Furthermore, the
location of uplink allocation for reference sensitivity may be adjusted to
avoid CIM5 spurious terms corrupting the reference sensitivity measurement. We
estimate that the uplink configuration as shown in Table 8.3.1-3 below.
Table 8.3.1-3: Restricted uplink size to minimize spectral regrowth
* * *
            Uplink RB restriction
1.4 MHz 6.4 → 6 RB 3 MHz 5.2 → 5 RB 5 MHz 3.9 → 3 RB
* * *
We observe that the resulting uplink allocations are very small due to the
small duplex separation for this band. In fact, we believe that such small
allocations as small as 3 RB are not well modeled. For example, it was
indicated in previous discussions that reducing the uplink allocation beyond a
certain point may not achieve the expected decrease in emissions. Thus, even
with the uplink allocations as shown above, the Tx spectral leakage may play a
non-trivial role in reference sensitivity. Moreover, we note that there are no
bands today with reference sensitivity uplink allocations smaller than 10 RB,
even in the case of CA_25A-25A. We therefore propose that the uplink
allocation for reference sensitivity be fixed to 5 RB (rather than 3 RB) for
the 5 MHz channel bandwidth.
As we have seen, due to the small Tx-Rx separation for this band, particular
attention must be paid to spurious products from the transmitter leaking into
the receiver. Tx PA spectral regrowth is largely controlled by reducing the
size of the uplink allocation, but CIM5 and other baseband harmonic
interference terms must also be controlled since these will also corrupt the
reference sensitivity measurement. We therefore propose the uplink
configuration for reference sensitivity in Table 8.3.1-4.
Table 8.3.1-4: Uplink configuration for reference sensitivity
* * *
            Uplink L\_CRB   Uplink RBstart
1.4 MHz 6 0 3 MHz 5 9 5 MHz 5 10
* * *
As usual for reference sensitivity, all downlink RB\'s will be allocated and
the uplink will be transmitted at P~UMAX~. One additional challenge this
brings is that the uplink will be transmitted without MPR due to the small
size of the allocation. Thus, the noise may be higher and this should be taken
into consideration.
### 8.3.2 Other contributing factors
Besides Tx spectral regrowth and Tx baseband harmonics and spurious products,
other factors also contribute to reference sensitivity degradation for bands
with closely spaced Tx and Rx such as this one. As was discovered during
CA_25A-25A studies, the LO phase noise, reciprocal mixing, and receiver second
order linearity also play significant roles. Of course, as with any other
band, but even more important for this one, the duplexer performance is
critical. A reference sensitivity analysis was conducted with the assumptions
in Table 8.3.2-1.

Based on this analysis, it is estimated that the value of reference
sensitivity in Table 8.3.2-2 can be achieved

###### ## Annex A (Informative): Analysis on BS Coexistence
# A.1 Analysis on BS Coexistence with TV system
The lower edge of UHF-TV band is 2MHz above the DL band and 12 MHz above the
UL band. According to current Brazilian channel allocation planning from
ANATEL, Class C (ERP 1.6 kW) for analog stations and Class A (ERP 8 kW) for
digital stations are considered as example scenarios in the blocking analysis.
## A.1.1 ATV Transmitter  LTE BS Receiver (Blocking)
The blocking analysis for Class C ATV transmitter to LTE450 BS is shown in
table A.1.1-1. Class C ATV transmit power (EIRP) is about 62+2.15 = 64.15
dBm/6MHz = 63.4 dBm/5MHz. The blocking requirement for LTE is -54 dBm for 1 dB
desense. Due to UHF-TV band is above the LTE450 down link band, normally the
rejection to DL band for RX filter is about 90 dB. Then the required antenna
to antenna coupling loss between LTE BS and ATV station is about 33.15 dB,
which can be easily achieved.

dBm/6MHz = 80.4 dBm/5MHz. The blocking requirement for LTE is -54 dBm for 1 dB
desense. Due to UHF-TV band is above the LTE450 down link band, normally the

which can be achieved in real deployment.

## A.1.3 LTE BS OOBE  DTV Receiver
The interference analysis for LTE450 BS OOBE to DTV receiver is shown in Table
A.1.3-1. The allowed interference level in TV receiver is -77-18=-95 dBm/6MHz
when analog TV transmitter is the interference source and -77-24=-101 dBm/6MHz
when DTV transmitter is the interference source. Using -101 dBm/6MHz as the
allowed interference level, the required antenna to antenna coupling loss
between LTE BS and DTV receiver is 115 dB. The distance separation estimation
for LTE BS interference to DTV receiver is shown in Table A.1.3-2.
Recommendation ITU-R P.1546 was used to estimate the distance separation. It
can be found that with 20 dB attenuation from the filter placed in the BS, the
distance separation between LTE BS and DTV receivers can be less than 1 km.
