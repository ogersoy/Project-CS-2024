# 4 Background
## 4.0 Overview
The present document is a technical report for Inter-band Carrier Aggregation
under Rel-12 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The document is
divided in two different parts:
\- Common part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs. Annex A contains a list of all CA combinations covered in
the present document as well as the status of each WI. The content of each
specific combination part can be considered as finalized when the current
status of the WI under Annex A is indicated as \"Closed\".
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the rapporteur of
each WI to ensure that the TPs related to the WI have been implemented.

carrier aggregation, the UE should support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [4] when
operating in single carrier mode.
##### 6.1.1.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_23-29
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 23 and Band 29 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.1.1.1.2-1 below:
Table 6.1.1.1.2-1: Band 23 and Band 29 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.1.1.1.2-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of Band 29
carriers may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 11 and 21, while the 2^nd^
IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 23 and Band
29 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 21, and the 3^rd^ IMD products
may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 12, 17, 28, 43 and 44. Note that
the calculation in table 6.1.1.1.2-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is
transmitting with the whole 20 MHz DL frequency of Band 23 and the whole 11
MHz DL frequency of Band 29\. But even if the BS is only transmitting an up to
10 MHz DL in Band 29 as stated in the WIDS, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 12, 17, 28, 43 and 44 as shown in
the last row in table 6.1.1.1.2-1.
It should be noted that Bands 11, 21, 28 and 44 are not intended for use in
the same geographical area as Bands 23 and 29. Therefore, the focus here will
be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 12, 17 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 43 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 23 and 29 BS transmitters do not share
the same antenna with Band 43 BS receiver. However, the 3^rd^ IMD products may
still fall into the BS receive band of Bands 12 and 17, which is only 1 MHz
away from Band 29 transmit band, and desensitize the receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 23 and 29 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 12 or 17 BS receiver to prevent Band 12 or 17
BS receiver desensitization, or with Band 43 BS receiver unless the antenna
path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 43 BS receiver desensitization.
##### 6.1.1.1.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For two simultaneous DL and one UL the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown in
table 6.1.1.1.3-1, and in table 6.1.1.1.3-2:

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE should support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [4] when
operating in single carrier mode.
##### 6.1.2.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_3-26 (1 UL/2 DL)
##### 6.1.2.1.2.0 Impact of harmonic interference
Table 6.1.2.1.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to
Band 3 or Band 26 for both UL and DL. It can be seen that UL harmonic
frequencies of Band 3 and Band 26 does not locate within the receive bands of
interest in the DL.

receive band of Bands 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 33,
35, 37, 39, 42, 43 and 44. Note that the calculation in table 6.1.2.1.2.1-1
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 75 MHz DL
frequency of Band 3 and the whole 35 MHz DL frequency of Band 26. If the BS is
only transmitting up to 20 MHz DL in Band 3 and up to 15 MHz DL in Band 26 as
stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 3, 9, 13, 14,18, 27, 33, 37 or 44 as shown in the last
row in table 6.1.2.1.2.1-1, and may only fall into the BS receive band of
certain frequency range within Bands 5 and 26 under the transmit
configurations shown in table 6.1.2.1.2.1-2 below.
Table 6.1.2.1.2.1-2: Band (3 + 26) BS transmit configurations with 3^rd^ IMD

-- 848,9
* * *
On the other hand, if the BS is only transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in Band 3,
i.e. 15 MHz and 20 MHz are not used, then there could not be 3^rd^ IMD
products within the BS receive band of Band 5 or 26. Moreover, only the
highest 10 MHz frequency spectrum in Band 8 (905 -- 915 MHz for UL and 950 --
960 MHz for DL) is allocated for mobile services in South Korea, thus the
2^nd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of Band 8 frequency
spectrum used in South Korea (905 -- 915 MHz) under the transmit
configurations shown in table 6.1.2.1.2.1-3 below.

-- 915
* * *
And the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of Band 8
frequency spectrum used in South Korea (905 -- 915 MHz) under the transmit
configurations (with a 15 or 20 MHz DL in Band 3) shown in table 6.1.2.1.2.1-4
below.

It should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 19, 20, 25, 35, 38, 39, 41, 42
and 43 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 3 and
26. Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD products
falling into Bands 3, 5, 8 and 26.
As shown above, the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 26 may fall
into the BS receive band of Band 3, while the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused
by mixing of Bands 3 and 26 DL carriers may fall within Bands 5, 8 and 26 UL
used in South Korea if certain BS transmit configurations are used, and hence
BS receiver desensitization may be an issue
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3 and 26 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 5, 8 or 26 BS receiver for the affected
frequency ranges if the aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used,
unless the antenna path meets very stringent 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 5, 8 or 26 BS receiver
desensitization.

It can be seen from table 6.1.4.1.2-2 that the upper edge of the 2^nd^
harmonics of BS transmit band of f1 (band 8) is on the lower edge of BS
receive band of f2 (band 1). It can also be seen that the 3^rd^ IMD falls into
BS receive band of band 8. However, as noted in subclause 5.1, these issues
can be regarded as covered in co-located BS scenarios and there is no need to
address in Inter-band carrier aggregation context.

It can be seen that the 3^rd^ IMD falls into BS receive band of band 3 and 28.
However, these products will not fall into the BS own receive block if the
frequency range as defined with the channel bandwidths given in table

##### 6.1.7.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_2-12
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 2 and Band 12 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.1.7.1.2-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.1.7.1.2-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of Band 12
carriers may fall into the BS receive band of Band 21, while the 2^nd^ IMD
products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 2 and Band 12 may
fall into the BS receive band of Band 41, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 28, 31, 33,
36, 37, 39, 42 and 44. Note that the calculation in table 6.1.7.1.2-1 (except
the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 60 MHz DL
frequency of Band 2 and the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band 12. If the BS is
only transmitting an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 2 and Band 12 as stated in the
WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of
Band 12, 13, 14, 17, 23, 25, 33 or 39 as shown in the last row in table
6.1.7.1.2-1.
It should be noted that Bands 1, 21, 28, 31, 39 and 44 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 2 and 12. Moreover, co-location of
Band (2 + 12) transmitter and Band 33, 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD
co-location on adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-
engineering solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus here
will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 22, 41 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 22, 41 or 42
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 2 and 12 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 22, 41 or 42 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 2 and 12 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 22, 41 or 42 BS receiver, unless the antenna
path meets very stringent 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the
PIM will not cause Band 22, 41 or 42 BS receiver desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.

It can be seen from table 6.1.8.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of
Band 2 and Band 13 carriers will not fall into the BS receive band of any
frequency band currently defined in 3GPP, but the 2^nd^ IMD products caused by
BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 2 and Band 13 may fall into the BS
receive band of Band 41, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22, 26, 27, 28, 31, 36, 37, 42
and 44. Note that the calculation in table 6.1.8.1.2.1-1 (except the last row)
assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band 2
and the whole 10 MHz DL frequency of Band 13. If the BS is only transmitting
an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 2 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 13 as stated in
the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band
of the Bands 1, 22, 28, 31, 36, 37, 42 and 44 as shown in the last row in
table 6.1.8.1.2.1-1.
It should be noted that that Bands 1, 18, 28, 31 and 44 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 2 and 13. Moreover, co-location of
Band (2 +13) transmitter and Band 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-
location on adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-
engineering solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus here
will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 12, 14, 17, 22, 26, 27, 41
and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive

expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 22, 41 or 42
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the

transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12, 14, 17, 22, 26, 27,
41 or 42 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 2 and 13 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with 12, 14, 17, 22, 26, 27, 41 or 42 BS receiver to
prevent Band 12, 14, 17, 22, 26, 27, 41 or 42 BS receiver desensitization,
unless the antenna path meets very stringent 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 12, 14, 17, 22, 26, 27, 41

It can be seen from Table 6.1.9.1.2-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of Band 12

The 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 5 may fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 3, 4, 9 and 10, and the 3^rd^ harmonics may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 38 and 41, while the 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 2 and Band 5 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 39 and 43. Note that the calculation in Table 6.1.10.1.2.1-1 (except
the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 60 MHz DL
frequency of Band 2 and the whole 25 MHz DL frequency of Band 5. If the BS is
only transmitting an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 2 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band
5 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS
receive band of the Bands 1, 8, 20, 36, 37 and 43 as shown in the last row in
Table 6.1.10.1.2.1-1.
It should be noted that that Bands 1, 3, 8, 9, 20 and 38 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 2 and 5. Moreover, co-location of
Band (2 + 5) transmitter and Band 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-
location on adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-
engineering solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus here
will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 4, 10, 41 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 4, 10, 41 or 43
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 2 and 5 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 4, 10, 41 or 43 BS
receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 2 and 5 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 4, 10, 41 or 43 BS receiver to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 2^nd^
and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 4, 10,
41 or 43 BS receiver desensitization.

It can be seen from Table 6.1.11.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 18 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9 and
10, and the 3^rd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 18 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 38 and 41, while the 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting CA of Band 1 and Band 18 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands
5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 42 and 44. Note that the calculation in Table
6.1.11.1.2.1-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the
whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band 1 and the whole 15 MHz DL frequency of Band
18. If the BS is only transmitting an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 1 and an up to
15 MHz DL in Band 18 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may
only fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 8, 19, 20, 22, 26 and 42 as
shown in the last row in Table 6.1.11.1.2.1-1, and the 3^rd^ IMD products will
not fall into the BS receive frequency range within Band 8 (900 -- 915 MHz)
that is allocated in Japan. Also the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the
BS receive band of certain frequency range within Band 19 under the transmit
configurations shown in Table 6.1.11.1.2.1-2 below.

It should be noted that Bands 4, 5, 10, 20, 26 and 38 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as Bands 1 and 18, and the 3^rd^ IMD products
caused by BS supporting CA of Band 1 and Band 18 will not fall into the BS
receive frequency range within Band 8 that is allocated in Japan. Therefore,
the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 3, 9, 19,
22, 41 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive

expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 3,

eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 1
and 18 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 3, 9, 22, 41 or
42 BS receiver.
On the other hand, it is recommended that Bands 1 and 18 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna with Band 3, 9, 22, 41 or 42 BS receiver, or
Band 19 BS receiver for the affected frequency ranges if the aforementioned BS
transmit configurations are used, in order to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent harmonics and
3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the harmonics and PIM will not cause
Band 3, 9, 19, 22, 41 or 42 BS receiver desensitization.

It can be seen that the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive band of
band 28. However, as described in subclause 5.1 of TR 36.850, due to the low-
high band combinations use separate antennas, this issue can be regarded as
covered in co-located BS scenarios and there is no need to address in inter-
band carrier aggregation context.

It can be seen from Table 6.1.13.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 5 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9 and
10, and the 3^rd^ harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 38 and
41, while the 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation
of Band 5 and Band 25 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 5, 6,
8, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37\. 39 and 43. Note that the
calculation in Table 6.1.13.1.2.1-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is
transmitting with the whole 25 MHz DL frequency of Band 5 and the whole 65 MHz
DL frequency of Band 25. If the BS is only transmitting an up to 10 MHz DL in
Band 5 and an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 25 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^
IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 8, 20, 23, 36,
37 and 43 as shown in the last row in Table 6.1.13.1.2.1-1.
It should be noted that Bands 1, 3, 8, 9, 20 and 38 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as Bands 5 and 25. Moreover, co-location of Band
(5 + 25) transmitter and Band 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-location
on adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-engineering
solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus here will be on
the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 4, 10, 23, 41 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 4, 10, 41 or 43
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 5 and 25 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 4, 10, 41 or 43 BS
receiver. But there is not a large frequency gap between Band 25 DL and Band
23 UL, and hence Band 23 BS receiver desensitization may still be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 5 and 25 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 4, 10, 23, 41 or 43 BS receiver to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 2^nd^
and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 4, 10,
23, 41 or 43 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by

It can be seen that the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive band of
band 5. However, as described in subclause 5.1 of TR 36.850, due to the low-
high band combinations use separate antennas, this issue can be regarded as
covered in co-located BS scenarios and there is no need to address in inter-
band carrier aggregation context.

is only transmitting an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 29 and an up to 10 MHz DL in
Band 30 as stated in the WIDS, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 8, 12, 17, 28, 40, 43 and 44 as shown in the last row
in Table 6.1.16.1.2.1-1.
It should be noted that Bands 6, 11, 21, 28, 40 and 44 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 29 and 30. Therefore, the focus
here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 12, 17, 24 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 24 or 43 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 29 and 30 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Band 24 or 43 BS receiver. However, the 3^rd^ IMD
products may still fall into the BS receive band of Bands 12 and 17, which is
only 1 MHz away from Band 29 transmit band, and desensitize the receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 29 and 30 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 12, or 17 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, or with Band 24 or 43 BS receiver unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM
will not cause Band 24 or 43 BS receiver desensitization.

Band 4 and Band 27 are a High-Low band combination. The UL harmonic
frequencies can be seen in table 6.1.17.1.2‑1. It can be seen that the UL
harmonics do not fall into the DL of either band. Therefore it can be
concludedthat there is no issue with UL harmonic interference to the DL.

It can also be seen from table 6.1.17.1.2-2 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics
of BS transmitting in Band 27 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4,
7, 10, 38 and 41, and the 3^rd^ IMD products into the BS receive band of Bands
5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27 and 42. Note that the calculation in table
6.1.17.1.2-2 (except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the
entire 45 MHz DL frequency of Band 4 and the entire 17 MHz DL frequency of
Band 27. If the BS is only transmitting in 20 MHz DL in Band 4 as stated in
the WIDs, the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of
Band 18 or 27 as shown in the last row in table 6.1.17.1.2-2. Also, in
countries where Band 27 and Band 8 can be deployed, only part of Band 8 that
is above the Band 5 downlink is deployed because of the overlap between Band 5
and Band 8. When the actual carrier bandwidths are factored in, the 3^Rd^ IMD
does not overlap with the part of Band 8 BS receive band that is deployed in
Korea, Brazil Australia or other countries where Band 27 and Band 8 will be
deployed.
It should be noted that Band 4 is not meant to be deployed in the same
geographic area as Bands 3, 6, 18, 19, 20. Therefore the focus here will be on
the harmonics of Band 27 falling into Bands 4, 7, 10, 38 and 41, and IMD
falling into Bands 5, 22, 26 and 42.
In order to avoid BS receiver desensitization due to the second and third
harmonics of Band 27, it is recommended that Band 27 BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with a receiver for Bands 4, 7, 10, 38 or 41.
With the performance of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 22, 26 and 42
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 4 and 27 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Bands 5, 22, 26 and 42 BS
receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause receiver desensitization.

It can be seen in table 6.1.18.1.2-2 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 27 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 7,
10, 38 and 41 and the second harmonics of Band 3 could fall into the receive
band of Band 43.
It can be seen that the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive band of
band 2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 35, 39, 42, 43 and 44\. Note
that the calculation in table 6.1.18.1.2-2 (except the last row) assumes the
BS is transmitting with the entire 75 MHz DL frequency of Band 3 and the
entire 17 MHz DL frequency of Band 27. If the BS is only transmitting an up to
20 MHz DL in Band 3 and 10 MHz in Band 27 as stated in the WIDs, the 3^rd^ IMD
products will not fall into the BS receive band of the Band 13, 14 18, 27, or
44 as shown in the last row in table 6.1.18.1.2-2. Also, in countries where
Band 27 and Band 8 can be deployed, only part of Band 8 that is above the Band
5 downlink is deployed because of the overlap between Band 5 and Band 8. When
the actual carrier bandwidths are factored in, the 3^rd^ IMD does not overlap
with the part of Band 8 BS receive band that is deployed in Korea, Brazil
Australia or other countries where Band 27 and Band 8 will be deployed.
It should be noted that Band 3 and Band 27 are not meant to be deployed
together in the same geographic area as Bands 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19,
20, 25, 39, 43. Therefore the focus here will be on the harmonics of Band 27
falling into Bands 3, 7, 38 and 41, and IMD products falling into Bands 5, 26,
35 and 42.
However, as described in subclause 5.1 of TR 36.850, due to the low and high
bands use separate antennas, these issues can be regarded as covered in co-
located BS scenarios and there is no need to address in inter-band carrier
aggregation context.

Table 6.1.19.1.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to

frequencies of Band 1 and Band 5 in DL are away from the BS receive bands of

It can be seen from table 6.1.19.1.2-2 that the 3^rd^ IMD products caused by
BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 1 and Band 5 may fall into the BS
receive bands of Band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27 and 42. However, when
the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3^rd^ order IMD products do
not fall into the BS receive of Band 5, 6, 18, 19, 26 and 27.
It should be noted that Bands 4, 9, 10, 20, and 22 are not intended for use in
the same geographical area as Band 1 and 5. Consequently, the focus here will
be on the harmonics and IMD products falling into Bands 3, 8, 38, 41 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Bands 3,
8, 38, 41 and 42 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band 1 and 5 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 3, 8, 38, 41 or 42 BS receivers for the
affected frequency ranges.

transmitting of Band 12 and Band 30 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.1.20.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Bands 12 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 21, while
the 2^nd^ IMD products of BS transmitting in Bands 12 and 30 may fall into the
BS receive band of Band 24, and the 3^rd^ IMD products supporting CA of Band
12 and Band 30 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 8, 20, 28, 40 and
44. Note that the calculation in table 6.1.20.1.2.1-1 (except the last row)
assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band 12
and the whole 10 MHz DL frequency of Band 30. However, even if the BS is only
transmitting an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 12 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 30
as stated in the WIDS, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 8, 20, 28, 40 and 44 as shown in the last row in table
6.1.20.1.2.1-1.
It should be noted that Bands 8, 20, 21, 28, 40 and 44 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 12 and 30. Therefore, the focus
here will be on the IMD falling into Band 24.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 24 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 12 and 30 BS transmitters do not share
the same antenna with Band 24 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 12 and 30 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 24 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 2^nd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 24 BS receiver
desensitization.

As it can be seen from table 6.1.21.1.2-1, the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics
from BS transmitting in Band 20 may fall in the BS receive band of Bands 24,
40. 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6,
13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43, 44.
Note that the calculation in table 6.1.21.1.2-1 (except the last row) assumes
the BS is transmitting with the whole 30 MHz DL frequency of Band 20 and the
whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band 1. If the BS is only transmitting up to 10
MHz DL in Band 20 and up to 15 MHz DL in Band 1 as stated in the WID, then the
3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of certain frequency
range within Bands 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, of which only Band 20 is
intended to be used in the same geographical area.
The transmit configurations of the BS transmitting in Bands 1+20 with 3^rd^
IMD products into Band 20 receive band are:

As it can be seen from table 6.1.21.1.2-2 only when Band 1 uses 15MHz or 20MHz
there may be IMD products falling into Band 20 receive band. In such cases, it
could be necessary to avoid sharing the same RF path for both transmitter and
receiver side, or avoid such configurations in the BS.
In table 6.1.21.1.2-3 the harmonic interference study is provided from UL
perspective for Band 1 and 20. It can be seen that the harmonic frequencies do
not fall into the frequency ranges of both bands as observed in table
6.1.21.1.2-3. Therefore it can be concluded that there is no issue on harmonic
interference.

As shown in Table 6.1.22.1.2-2, second order intermodulation products may fall
to UL frequencies of Band 38 or 41.
Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 2, 5-6,
13-14, 18-20, 22, 25-27, 35, 39, 42 or 44. It should be noted intermodulation
products may fall to own receive block of Band 20 (highlighted in Table
6.1.22.1.2-2). As this combination is Low-High frequency combination, it is
assumed there will be no issue as separate antennas will be used for Band 3
and Band 20.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 3 and Band 20 should not
share the same antenna with Band 2, 5-6, 13-14, 18-20, 22, 24-27, 35 or 38-44
BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM

As shown in Table 6.1.23.1.2-2, second order intermodulation products may fall
to UL frequencies of Band 2, 22, 25, 35, 39 or 42.
Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 5-6, 13-14,
18-20, 26-27, 38, 41 or 44. It should be noted intermodulation products may
fall to own receive block of Band 20 (highlighted in Table 6.1.23.1.2-2). As
this combination is Low-High frequency combination, it is assumed there will
be no issue as separate antennas will be used for Band 7 and Band 20.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 7 and Band 20 should not
share the same antenna with Band 2, 5-6, 13-14, 18-20, 22, 24-27, 35, 38-42 or
44 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 2, 5-6, 13-14, 18-20, 22,

It can be seen from Table 6.1.24.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 12 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 21, while
the 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting CA of Band 4 and Band 12 may
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 28, 42, 43 and 44.
Note that the calculation in Table 6.1.24.1.2.1-1 (except the last row)
assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 45 MHz DL frequency of Band 4
and the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band 12. If the BS is only transmitting
an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 4 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 1 as stated in the
WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of
the Bands 12, 17, 22, 28, 42, 43 and 44 as shown in the last row in Table
6.1.24.1.2.1-1, and the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS own (up
to 10 MHz) receive block within Band 12, and may only fall into the BS receive
band of certain frequency range within Band 12 and Band 17 under the transmit
configurations shown in Table 6.1.24.1.2.1-2 below.

* * *
It should be noted that Bands 21, 28 and 44 are not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Bands 4 and 12. Therefore, the focus here will be on
the IMD falling into Bands 12, 17, 22, 42 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 22, 42 or 43
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 4 and 12 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 22, 42 or 43 BS receiver.
On the other hand, it is recommended that Bands 4 and 12 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna with Band 22, 42 or 43 BS receiver, or Band
12 or 17 BS receiver for the affected frequency ranges if the aforementioned
BS transmit configurations are used, in order to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 12, 17, 22, 42 or 43BS
receiver desensitization.

It can be seen from Table 6.1.25.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 12 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 21, while
the 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting CA of Band 7 and Band 12 may

14, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28, 38, 41 and 44. Note that the calculation in Table
6.1.25.1.2.1-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the
whole 70 MHz DL frequency of Band 7 and the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band
12. If the BS is only transmitting up to 20 MHz DL in Band 7 and an up to 10
MHz DL in Band 12 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may only
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 12, 17, 28, 38, 41 and 44 as shown
in the last row in Table 6.1.25.1.2.1-1, and the 3^rd^ IMD products will not
fall into the BS own (up to 10 MHz) receive block within Band 12, and may only
fall into the BS receive band of certain frequency range within Band 12 under
the transmit configurations shown in Table 6.1.25.1.2.1-2 below.

It should be noted that Bands 1, 28 and 44 are not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Bands 7 and 12. Also, bands 33, 35, 36, 37, 38 and
39 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as band 7 and 12.
Therefore, the focus here will be on the IMD falling into Bands 2, 12, 17, 22

With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive

In addition to this, it is recommended that Bands 7 and 12 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna with Band 26 BS receiver, or Band 12 BS

It can be seen from table 6.2.1.1.2-1 that that the 3^rd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Bands 28 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40,
while the 3^rd^ IMD products supporting CA of Band 1 and Band 28 may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28,
42, 43 and 44. Note that the calculation in table 6.2.1.1.2-1 (except the last
row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band
1 and the whole 45 MHz DL frequency of Band 28. If the BS is only transmitting
an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 1 and an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 28 as stated in
the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band
of the Bands 13, 14, 18, 22, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43 and 44 as shown in the last
row in table 6.2.1.1.2-1. Moreover, the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into
the BS receive band of certain frequency range within Bands 18, 26, 27 and 28
under the transmit configurations shown, respectively, in tables 6.2.1.1.2-2,
6.2.1.1.2-3, 6.2.1.1.2-4 and 6.2.1.1.2-5 below. Note that the available
frequency range for mobile cellular communications in Japan is 718 -- 748 MHz
for UL and 773 -- 803 MHz for DL.

It should be noted that Bands 13, 14, 30, 40 and 43 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as Bands 1 and 28. Moreover, co-location of Band
(1 + 28) transmitter and Band 44 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-location on
adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-engineering
solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus here will be on
the IMD falling into Bands 18, 22, 26, 27, 28 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 22 or 42 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 1 and 28 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Band 22 or 42 BS receiver.
On the other hand, it is recommended that Bands 1 and 28 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna with Band 22 or 42 BS receiver, or Band 18,
26, 27 or 28 BS receiver for the affected frequency ranges if the
aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used, in order to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^
order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 18, 22, 26, 27, 28
or 42 BS receiver desensitization.

##### 6.2.1.1.4 Maximum sensitivity reduction for Band 1
When Band 1 DL is operated simultaneously with Band 28 UL there is a potential
self-interference situation as the third harmonic of Band 28 UL will be on the
same frequency range as the Band 1 DL. It is agreed that 3GPP will set the
limit for this interference by specifying maximum sensitivity degradation
(MSD) in TS 36.101 [4]. After intensive discussion in RAN4, required MSDs are
specified in Table 6.2.1.1.4-1.

##### 6.3.1.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1UL/2DL
Table 6.3.1.1.2-1 gives the intermodulation products for band 1 + band 7 CA
with 2DLs. For the 3-tone IMD analysis the maximum transmission as defined in
table 6.3.1.1.1-1 is considered. Three-tone third order IMD products will not
fall into the BS own receive block if the frequency range as defined with the
channel bandwidths given in table 6.3.1.1.1-1 are used for the more detailed
IMD calculation.
Considering bands in the same geographical area it is observed that the BS
distortion could fall into the BS receive bands of band 3. With the
performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive path
components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters the IMDs
generated within the band 3 receiver should be well below the receiver noise
floor eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization. Provided that
the bands 1 and 7 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with band

##### 6.3.2.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1UL/2DL
Table 6.3.2.1.2-1 gives the intermodulation products for band 39 + band 41 CA
with 2 DLs. For the 3-tone IMD analysis the maximum transmission as defined in
table 6.3.2.1.1-1 is considered. None of the harmonics of one band fall into
the receive band of the other. The intermodulation products generated by two
operating bands do not impact the own receiver since TDD BS cannot transmit
and receive simultaneously in a single band.
All the possible interference to other operating bands is listed in table
6.3.2.1.2-2. It can be seen in the table that 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall
into BS receive band of band 43, two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall
into BS receive band of band 12, 13, 14,17, 27, 28, 44, two-tone 3^rd^ order
IMD products may fall into BS receive band of band 22 and band 42, and three-
tone 3^rd^ order IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of
band 39 and band 41 may fall into the BS receive band of band 1, 2, 7, 25, 33,
35, 36, 37, 38.
Currently Bands 1, 42 and 44 are used in the same geographical area as Bands
39 and 41. With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit
and receive path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and
filters, it is expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 1,
42 or 44 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor, in order to
avoid the possibility of receiver desensitization. Thus it is recommended that
Bands 39 and 41 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 1, 42
or 44 BS receivers, unless the antenna path meets more stringent 2^nd^ and
3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 1, 42 or 44
BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.

Table 6.3.2.1.2-3 gives the harmonic products for band 39 + band 41 CA with 1
UL. None of the harmonic products fall into the own receive bands. For the UE,
the distortion of band 39 could fall into the UE receive bands for band 43. As
currently there is no deployment for band 39&41 and band 43 in the same
geographical area, and a UE does not operate simultaneously in B39 + B41 and
band 43, this should be not a problem in case the UE supports this band.

##### 6.3.2.1.3 UEs supporting or not supporting simultaneous reception and
transmission
According to TS 36.331 [5], for inter-band TDD CA, there is an element
simultaneous Rx-Tx in the IE UE-EUTRA-Capability described as following.
**_simultaneousRx-Tx_**
_Indicates whether the UE supports simultaneous reception and transmission on
different bands for each band combination listed in supportedBandCombination.
This field is only applicable for inter-band TDD carrier aggregation._
According to this capability, two kinds of UEs can be considered for inter-
band TDD carrier aggregation, i.e. the UE supporting simultaneous reception
and transmission on different bands and the UE not supporting simultaneous
reception and transmission on different bands. Accordingly, different UE
reference architecture may be considered for UE requirement development
depending on the need.
The focus of current TDD inter-band CA is 2DL+1UL not supporting simultaneous
Tx/Rx. In this regard, the following reference UE architecture will be used as
baseline for UE requirement development. The benefits of this architecture is
that there would be no relaxation necessary for maximum output power which is
critical for operation uplink coverage.

to the Reference UE architecture in Figure 6.3.2.1.3-1.

It can be seen from Table 6.3.3.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 8 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33,
35,37 and 39 and none of 3^rd^ harmonics may fall into the any E-UTRA
operating BS receive band. In addition 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in
Band 27 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 10 and 3^rd^
harmonics may fall into BS receive band of Bands 7, 38 and 41.
Meanwhile the 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation
of Band 8 and Band 27 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 3, 9 and 3^rd^
IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Band 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 18,
19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 41 and 44. Note that the calculation in Table
6.3.3.1.2.1-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the
whole 35 MHz DL frequency of Band 8 and the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band
27.
If the BS is only transmitting an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 8 and 10 MHz in Band
27 as stated in the WIDs, the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of the Band 6, 8, or 18
It should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 25, 33, 35, 37, 38
and 39 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 8 and
27. Therefore, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into
Bands 3, 5, 7, 9, 26, 27, 28, 41 and 44. With the performances of the current
BS antenna system, transmit and receive path components, amplifiers, pre-
distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected that the IMD interference
generated within the Band 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26, 27, 28, 41 or 44 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 8 and 27 BS transmitters do not share the
same antenna with Band 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26, 27, 28, 41 or 44 BS receiver.

##### 6.3.4.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_1-3
Table 6.3.4.1.2-1 gives the harmonics and IMD products for band 1 + band 3 CA
with 2DLs. It shows that the second harmonics may fall into BS receive band of
Band 43, and no third harmonics will fall into any BS receive band specified
by 3GPP. In addition, no second order intermodulation products will fall into
any BS receive band. The third order intermodulation products may fall into
the BS receive band of Band 2, 7, 11, 21, 24, 25, 35, 39, 40 and 41.
Note that Band 2, 25 and 35 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Band 1 and Band 3. It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of
Band 1 and Band 3 should not share the same antenna with Band 7, 11, 21, 24,
39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent
third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 7, 11, 21,
24, 39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver desensitization. Specific analysis on the
harmonics and IMD products with consideration on the adopted bandwidth and the
carrier places are needed if considering the shared antenna.

As it can be seen from table 6.3.5.1.2-1, the 2^nd^ order harmonics from BS
transmitting in Band 8 may fall in the BS receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33, 35,
37, 39. Additionally 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10, 24, 42 and 43. While 3^rd^ order IMD products may
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26,
27, 28, 38, 41 and 44.
Note that the calculation in table 6.3.5.1.2-1 (except the last row) assumes
the BS is transmitting with the whole 70 MHz DL frequency of Band 7 and the
whole 35 MHz DL frequency of Band 8. If the BS is only transmitting up to 20
MHz DL in Band 7 and up to 10 MHz DL in Band 8 as stated in the WID, then the
3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of certain frequency
range within Bands 8, 38 and 41.
The transmit configurations of the BS transmitting in Bands 7+8 with 3^rd^ IMD
products into Band 8 receive band are:
Table 6.3.5.1.2-2: Band (7 + 8) BS transmit configurations with 3^rd^ IMD
within Bands 8 BS receive band (880-915MHz)
* * *
Band 8 DL channel bandwidth (MHz) lower edge of Band 8 DL frequency block

20 905 - 815
* * *
As it can be seen from table 6.3.5.1.2-2 when Band 7 uses 15/20MHz there may
be IMD products falling into Band 8 receive band. In such cases, it could be
necessary to avoid sharing the same RF path for both transmitter and receiver
side, or avoid such configurations in the BS.
In table 6.3.5.1.2-3 the harmonic interference study is provided from UL
perspective for Band 7 and 8. It can be seen that the harmonic frequencies
fall in the UL and DL bands of Band 3. This scenario is already covered by
current specifications and hence no further relaxation is required for that.
It can also be seen that 3^rd^ harmonic interference from UL Band 8 falls into
Band 7 receiver band in a general case. However it is under discussion if
current spectrum holdings can be taken into account, and be verified if there
is no harmonic impact.

##### 6.3.5.1.4 MSD
A part of the uplink of Band 8, specifically 880-897 MHz (only first 17 MHz)
may create third order harmonics into part of Band 7 downlink, specifically 2
640-2 690 MHz (only last 50 MHz).
The specification of this band into TS 36.101 will consider the additional
insertion losses of a low-high combination plus the additional trap filter to
attenuate the harmonic distortion. Additionally for those frequencies that can
create harmonic interference an exception to reference sensitivity (as derived
through MSD) is created.
The uplink configuration is limited in such a way that the 3^rd^ harmonic
overlap is maximized on the SCC in the high band. However, at the same time,
the uplink configuration should respect the limitations needed for reference
sensitivity on the PCC since both PCC and SCC are tested simultaneously. In
the case of Band 8, the uplink configuration is limited to 25 RB in Table
7.3.1-2 of TS 36.101. Thus, the upper limit for MSD testing should also be
limited to 25 RB so that the conditions for reference sensitivity on the PCC
can be maintained.

NOTE: These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within
the transmission bandwidth of the low band for which the 3^rd^ harmonic is
within transmission bandwidth of the high band. And this is applicable when
Band 8 UL is confined between 880MHz and 897MHz and simultaneously Band 7 DL
is confined within 2 640MHz and 2 690MHz. Otherwise this requirement does not
apply. The requirements is verified for UL EARFCN of the low band (superscript
LB) such that $f_{\text{UL}}^{\text{LB}} = \left\lfloor
f_{\text{DL}}^{\text{HB}}/0\text{.}3 \right\rfloor\ 0\text{.}1$in MHz and

It can be seen from Table 6.3.6.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics as
well as the 2^nd^ IMD products of BS transmitting in Bands 2 and 30 will not
fall into the BS receive band of any frequency band currently defined in 3GPP,
but the 3^rd^ IMD products supporting CA of Band 2 and Band 30 may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 1, 24, 30, 36, 37 and 40. Note that the
calculation in Table 6.3.6.1.2.1-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is
transmitting with the whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band 2 and the whole 10 MHz
DL frequency of Band 30. If the BS is only transmitting an up to 20 MHz DL in
Band 2 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 30 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^
IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 24, 36, 37 and
40 as shown in the last row in Table 6.3.6.1.2.1-1.
It should be noted that Bands 1 and 40 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 2 and 30. Moreover, co-location of Band (2 + 30)
transmitter and Band 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-location on
adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-engineering
solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus here will be on
the harmonics and IMD falling into Band 24.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 24 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 2 and 30 BS transmitters do not share the
same antenna with Band 24 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 2 and 30 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 24 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 24 BS receiver
desensitization.
##### 6.3.6.1.3 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB (1 UL)
The transmitter and receiver requirements for CA_2A-30A are based on a front-
end reference architecture supporting multiplexing of Band 2, Band 4 and Band
30 (\"hexplexer\") that in turn enables support of the band combinations Band
2 + Band 4, Band 2 + Band 30 and Band 4 + Band 30 in the same device. More
details can be found in clause 6.3.2 of [8].

transmitting of Band 4 and Band 30 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.3.7.1.2.1-1 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.3.7.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics as
well as the 2^nd^ IMD products of BS transmitting in Bands 4 and 30 will not
fall into the BS receive band of any frequency band currently defined in 3GPP,
but the 3^rd^ IMD products supporting CA of Band 4 and Band 30 may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 7, 25, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and
41. Note that the calculation in Table 6.3.7.1.2.1-1 (except the last row)
assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 45 MHz DL frequency of Band 4
and the whole 10 MHz DL frequency of Band 30. If the BS is only transmitting
an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 4 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 30 as stated in
the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band
of Bands 1, 2, 7, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 as shown in the last
row in Table 6.3.7.1.2.1-1.
It should be noted that Bands 1, 7, 33, 38, 39 and 40 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as Bands 4 and 30. Therefore, the focus here
will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 2, 25, 35, 36, 37 and 41.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 2, 25, 35, 36, 37
or 41 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 4 and 30 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 2, 25, 35, 36, 37 or 41
receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 4 and 30 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 2, 25, 35, 36, 37 or 41 BS receiver to
prevent BS receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 2,
25, 35, 36, 37 or 41 BS receiver desensitization.
##### 6.3.7.1.3 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB (1 UL)
Just as for CA_2A-30A (clause 6.3.6.1.3), the transmitter and receiver
requirements for CA_4A-30A are based on a front-end reference architecture
supporting multiplexing of Band 2, Band 4 and Band 30 (\"hexplexer\") that in
turn enables support of the band combinations Band 2 + Band 4, Band 2 + Band
30 and Band 4 + Band 30 in the same device. More details can be found in

##### 6.3.8.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1UL/2DL
Table 6.3.8.1.2-1 gives the intermodulation products for Band 41 + Band 42 CA
with 2 DLs. None of the harmonics of one band fall into the receive band of
the other. The intermodulation products generated by two operating bands do
not impact the own receiver since TDD BS cannot transmit and receive
simultaneously in a single band.
IMD products of Bands 41 and 42 could fall into RX frequency range of some
operating bands. However, it could be hard for those low bands less than 1GHz
to share the same antenna with Band 41 and Band 42. IMD products could fall
into Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 43 and 44, while Bands 1, 3,
5, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28, 39, 43 or 44 could be used in the same
geographical area (Region 3) as Bands 41 and 42. With the performances of the
current BS antenna system, transmit and receive path components, amplifiers,
pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected that the IMD
interference generated within the Band 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28,
39, 43 or 44 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor, in order
to avoid the possibility of receiver desensitization. Thus it is recommended
that Bands 41 and 42 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band
1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28, 39, 43 or 44 BS receivers, unless the
antenna path meets more stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the
PIM will not cause Band 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 21, 27, 28, 39, 43 or 44 BS
receivers desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.

##### 6.3.9.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_5-13
Table 6.3.9.1.2-1 shows harmonics frequency limits intermodulation products
frequency limits for CA of Band 5 and Band 13.
As shown in table 6.3.9.1.2-1, 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 5
may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9 and 10; and the 3^rd^
harmonics of Band 5 could fall into the BS receive band of Band 38, 41.

It also can be seen that 2^nd^ order intermodulation products may fall into BS
receive band of Band 24. 3^rd^ intermodulation products may fall to UL
frequencies of Bands 7, 8, 20, 28, 40, 41 and 44.
It should be noted that Band 5 and Band 13 are not meant to be deployed
together in the same geographic area as Bands 3, 8, 9, 20, 28, 38, 40 and 44.
Therefore the focus here will be on the harmonics of Band 5 falling into Bands
4, 10 and 41, and IMD products falling into Band 7, 24 and 41.
It is recommended that Band 5 and Band 13 BS transmitters not share an antenna
with Band 4, 7, 10, 24 or 41 BS receivers. However Band 4, 7, 10, 24 and 41
would use separate antennas from Band 5 and Band 13, due to that high/low
bands use separate antennas at BS side. There is no need to address above
issue in inter-band carrier aggregation context.

It can be seen from Table 6.3.10.1.2.1-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 18 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9 and
10, and the 3^rd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 18 and restricted Band
28 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 30, 38, 40 and 41, while the
2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting CA of Band 18 and restricted Band
28 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 24, and the 3^rd^ IMD products
may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20,
26, 28, 40, 41 and 44. Note that the calculation in Table 6.3.10.1.2.1-1
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 15 MHz DL
frequency of Band 18 and the whole 30 MHz DL frequency of restricted Band 28.
If the BS is only transmitting an up to 15 MHz DL in Band 18 and an up to 10
MHz DL in restricted Band 28 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD
products may only fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 7, 8, 12, 13, 14,
17, 20, 28, 40, 41 and 44 as shown in the last row in Table 6.3.10.1.2.1-1.
Note that the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS receive frequency
range within restricted Band 28, or the BS receive frequency range within Band
8 (900 -- 915 MHz) that is allocated in Japan. Also the 3^rd^ IMD products may
only fall into the BS receive band of certain frequency range within Band 28
under the transmit configurations shown in Table 6.3.10.1.2.1-2 below.
Table 6.3.10.1.2.1-2: Band (18 + 28) BS transmit configurations with 3^rd^ IMD
within Band 28 BS receive band
* * *
Band 18 DL channel bandwidth (MHz) Band 28 DL channel bandwidth (MHz) Lower
edge of Band 28 DL frequency block (MHz) Lower edge of IMD frequency limits
(MHz) 15 5 or 10 758 -- 762,9 743 -- 747,9
* * *
It should be noted that Bands 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 24, 30, 38, 40 and
44 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 18 and 28,
and the 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band
18 and Band 28 will not fall into the BS receive frequency range within Band 8
that is allocated in Japan. Therefore, the focus here will be on the harmonics
and IMD falling into Bands 3, 9, 28 and 41.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 3,
9 or 41 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 18 and 28 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 3, 9 or 41 BS receiver.
On the other hand, it is recommended that Bands 18 and 28 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna with Band 3, 9 or 41 BS receiver, or Band 28
BS receiver for the affected frequency ranges if the aforementioned BS
transmit configurations are used, in order to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent harmonics and
3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the harmonics and PIM will not cause
Band 3, 9, 28 or 41BS receiver desensitization.
##### 6.3.10.1.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Given that CA_B18-B28 is low-low band combination, appropriate UE architecture
would be quadplexer basis. As one can see in Figure 6.3.10.1.3-1, separation
between Band 18 UL and Band 28 DL is only 12 MHz. In addition, Band 18 filter
cannot provide steep attenuation toward lower frequency side. Therefore, it is
expected that Band 28 UE would suffer from noise of Band 18 UL and it was
considered that inter-band CA of this combination is almost impossible to keep
commercial service of quality.

Figure 6.3.10.1.3-1: Frequency range of Band 18 and Band 28
However, it is expected that Lower Duplexer of Band 28 DL can provide good
blocking characteristic from unwanted signal of Band 18 UL because separation
between them is more than twice (27 MHz) of upper duplexer. Operator A in the
figure can fortunately use both Lower and Higher Duplexer from perspective of
frequency assignment. Therefore, quadplexer to perform CA_B18-B28 is much
preferable to be implemented by [Band 18] + [Band 28 Lower DUP] as indicated
by red line in Figure 6.3.10.1.3-1. Values of ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ would be
standardized on the basis of such architecture of quadplexer.
For the reported IL values, additional IL values compared to single band
operation could be assumed as shown in table 6.3.10.1.3-1:

By convoluting above all of studies, values for ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ are
specified as in Table 6.3.10.1.3-3 and 6.3.10.1.3-4.:

##### 6.3.10.1.4 Maximum sensitivity reduction for Band 28
When Band 28 DL is operated simultaneously with Band 18 UL there is a
potential self-interference situation as Band 18 UL will become aggressor on
Band 28 DL due to narrow frequency separation. Requirements like MSD should be
specified for this interference. After intensive discussion in RAN4, required
MSDs are specified in Table 6.3.10.1.4-1.

Table 6.4.1.2-1 shows harmonics frequency limits and table 6.4.1.2-2
intermodulation products frequency limits for CA of Band 2 and Band 4,
respectively.

As shown in table 6.4.1.2-2, no second order intermodulation products will
fall to any 3GPP UL frequencies. Third intermodulation products may fall to UL
frequencies of Bands 1-4, 9-10, 23, 25, 30, 33, 35-37, 39 or 40\. As third
intermodulation products may fall to own receive block (both for Band 2 and
Band 4, highlighted in table 6.4.1.2-2), the desensitization may be an issue.
Analysis in table 6.4.1.2-2 assumes BS is transmitting the whole DL frequency
for both Band 2 and Band 4. Further analysis were made when two-tone third
order intermodulation product will fall to own receive block for CC bandwidths
agreed in the Work Item Description (WID): 5MHz, 10MHz and 15MHz for both
operating bands plus 1,4 and 3MHz for Band 2. Two-tone third order
intermodulation products were summarized in table 6.4.1-3 with assumptions
shown in figure 6.4.1.2-1.

Taking into account CC bandwidths agreed in the WID, two-tone third order
intermodulation product will fall to own receive block for CC1 and CC2
positions summarized in table 6.4.1.2-4. Considered scenarios are very
pessimistic as studies are taking into account channel bandwidths. Taking into
account transmission bandwidths (1,08; 2,7; 4,5; ... MHz) the region where IMD
would fall to receive band would be further reduced.

It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 2 and Band 4 should not
share the same antenna with Band 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23, 25, 30, 33, 35-37, 39
or 40 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23,
25, 30, 33, 35-37, 39 or 40 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.4.1.3 UE Co-existence studies for CA_2-4
The scope of the WID states that the specifications are done for 1 UL
operation. Because of that IMD studies between the UL bands are not required
for now. Study of UL 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics frequencies is needed.
Results of the harmonic study are presented in table 6.4.1.3-1. It can be
observed that none of the 2^nd^ or 3^rd^ harmonic products fall into own DL
bands. It can be noted that band 4 second harmonic extends to 3 510 MHz which
is the start frequency for band 22 and some harmonic power might land on band
22. Band 4 second harmonic also falls to band 42. Band 2 second harmonic falls
to band 43.

#### 6.4.1.4 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB values
The following additional ILs for combining band 2+4 were reported by three
filter manufacturers. Simulations were performed for typical performance but
as the duplex-filter baseline performance and quadplexer performance were both
simulated it can be assumed that performance difference stays constant under
ETC conditions.

As band 19 and band 21 are a low-middle band combination the harmonic
frequencies are far away from the receive and transmit bands of interest in
the DL and UL (see table 6.5.1.1.2-1). Therefore it can be concludedthat there
is no issue on harmonic interference.

From table 6.5.2.1.2-2, it is observed that:
\- 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics don't fall into any 3GPP defined BS receive
frequencies.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD will fall into BS receive frequencies of Band 42, 43.
\- Two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD will fall into BS receive frequencies of Band 5,
6, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27 and 44.
\- Three-tone 3^rd^ order IMD will fall into BS receive frequencies of Band
11, 21.
On the other hand, the issue of possible desensitization due to IMD fall down
would happen whenever a BS supports these frequencies simultaneously,
regardless of whether CA is supported or not. Thus this is not a CA specific
issue and BS vendors are requested to configure a BS appropriately when the
bands mentioned above are operated with Band 1 and 11.

\- Two-tone 3^rd^ order IMDs will fall into BS receive frequencies of Band 22,
23, 34 and 42.
\- Three-tone 3^rd^ order IMDs will fall into BS receive frequencies of Band
8, 21.
On the other hand, the issue of possible desensitization due to IMD fall down
would happen whenever a BS supports these frequencies simultaneously,
regardless of whether CA is supported or not. Thus this is not a CA specific
issue and BS vendors are requested to configure a BS appropriately when the
bands mentioned above are operated with Band 8 and 11.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE should support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [4] when
operating in single carrier mode.
##### 7.2.1.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_1-41
Table 7.2.1.1.2-1gives the intermodulation products for band 1 + band 41 CA
with 2 DLs. For the IMD analysis the maximum transmission as defined in table
7.2.1.1.1-1 is considered. None of the harmonics of one band fall into the
receive band of the other. The intermodulation products generated by two
operating bands do not impact the own receiver since TDD BS cannot transmit
and receive simultaneously in a single band.
It can be seen in the table that 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into BS
receive band 31. The 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into BS receive bands
of 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 23, 24, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41. However,
when the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3^rd^ order IMD
products do not fall into the BS receive of Band 1, 23, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37,
39, 40.
It should be noted that Bands 4, 7, 10, 24, 31 and 38 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as Band 1 and Band 41. This leaves bands 3, 9
and 41 to consider for IMD products.
Currently Bands 3, and 9 are used in the same geographical area as Bands 1 and
41. It is recommended that Bands 1 and 41 BS transmitters do not share the
same antenna with Band 3 or 9 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not
cause Band 3 or 9 BS receiver desensitization. A TDD BS cannot transmit and
receive simultaneously in a single band so the own B41 receiver is protected.
However, it is not recommended that different band 41 operators share the same
antenna as a Band 1 transmitter unless the operation is synchronized.

It can be seen from table 7.2.2.1.2-1 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by
BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 1 and Band 42 fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 11 and 21, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 1, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25,
26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43 and 44. Note that the
calculation in table 7.2.2.1.2-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS
transmits the whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band 1 and the whole 200 MHz DL
frequency of Band 42. However even if the BS only transmits up to 20 MHz DL in
Band 1 and up to 20 MHz DL in Band 42 as stated in Table 7.2.2.1.1-1, the
3^rd^ IMD products may still fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6,
8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43 and 44 as shown in the
last row in table 7.2.2.1.2-1.
It should be noted that Bands 12, 13, 14, 17 is not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Band 1 and Band 22 is not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Band 42. Consequently, the focus here will be on the
harmonics and IMD products falling into Bands 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28,
42, 43 and 44.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously, so the BS's own band 42
receiver and other synchronized band 42 receivers would not be interfered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19,
20, 26, 27, 28 or unsynchronized 44 receiver would be well below the receiver
noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization,
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 1 and 42 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28,
unsynchronized 42, unsynchronized 43 or unsynchronized 44 BS receiver, unless
the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that
the PIM will not cause Band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, unsynchronized
42, unsynchronized 43 or unsynchronized 44 BS receiver desensitization.

Table 7.2.3.1.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to
Band 3 or Band 40 for both UL and DL. It can be seen that the harmonic
frequencies of Band 3 and Band 40 in DL are away from the BS receive bands of
interest in the UL. For the UE aspect, the UL harmonic frequencies of Band 3
and Band 40 does not locate within the UE receive bands of interest in the DL.
Therefore it can be concluded that there is no issue on harmonic interference.

It can be seen from Table 7.2.3.1.2-2 that the 2^nd^ order IMD products may
fall into the BS receive band of Band 31. The 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 3 and Band 40 may fall into the BS
receive bands of Band 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 25, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39,
and 40. However, when the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3^rd^
order IMD products do not fall into the BS receive of Band 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 33,
36, and 37.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 25, 30, 31, and 35 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Band 3 and 40. Consequently,
the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD products falling into Bands
39, and 40.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously, so the BS's own band 40
receiver and other synchronized band 40 receivers would not be interfered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
noted that the harmonics and IMD interference generated in common signal paths
within Band 39, if unsynchronized with band 40 may not be well below the
receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization.
Operating band 39 together with band 3 and 40 CA it is either recommended to
synchronize bands 39 and 40 carriers or to have at least one of the three
carrier signals using separate feeders.

##### 7.2.4.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_8-40
Table 7.2.4.1.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to
Band 8 or Band 40 for both UL and DL. It can be seen that the harmonic
frequencies of Band 8 and Band 40 in DL are away from the BS receive bands of
interest in the UL. For the UE aspect, the UL harmonic frequencies of Band 8
and Band 40 does not locate within the UE receive bands of interest in the DL.
Therefore it can be concluded that there is no issue on harmonic interference.

The 2^nd^ DL harmonics of Band 8 carriers may fall into the BS receive band of

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 8 and Band 40 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in

It can be seen from Table 4 that the 2^nd^ order IMD products will fall into
the BS receive bands of Band 11 and 21. The 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 8 and Band 40 may fall into the BS
receive bands of Band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 30, 31, 40, and 43. However,
when the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3^rd^ order IMD
products do not fall into the BS receive of Band 5, 18, 19, 20, and 26.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 6, 11, 18, 19, 21, 25, 30, and 31 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Band 8 and 40. Consequently,
the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD products falling into Bands 8,
33, 35, 37, 39, 40 and 43.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously, so the BS's own band 40
receiver and other synchronized band 40 receivers would not be interfered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it
recommended that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Bands
8, 33, 35, 37, 39, 43, and unsynchronized Band 40 generated in common signal
paths is carefully considered. (E.g. by separating band Tx path from the other
bands in the feeder system).

It can be seen from table 7.2.5.1.2-1 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by
BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 3 and Band 42 fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10, 24 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24, 25, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42 and 43. Note that the calculation in table 6.5.2.1.2-1
(except the last row) assumes the BS transmits the whole 20 MHz DL frequency
of Band 3 and the whole 200 MHz DL frequency of Band 42. However even if the
BS only transmits up to 20 MHz DL in Band 3 and up to 20 MHz DL in Band 42 as
stated in Table 7.2.5.1.1-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still fall into the BS
receive band of the Bands 22, 42, 43 as shown in the last row in table
7.2.5.1.2-1.
##### 7.2.5.1.3 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
Following relaxations are allowed for the UE which supports inter-band carrier
aggregation of Band 3 and Band 42. These relaxations are derived from the
assumption that harmonic trap filter for Band 3 is not considered. The
relaxations based on the implement of harmonic trap filter are FFS.

##### 7.2.6.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_26-41
##### 7.2.6.1.2.0 Harmonics and IMD products
Table 7.2.6.1.2-1gives the intermodulation products for Band 26 + Band 41 CA
with 2 DLs. For the IMD analysis the maximum transmission as defined in table
7.2.6.1.1-1 is considered. It can be seen from the table that the 2^nd^
harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 26 may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 3, 4, 9 and 10 and the 3^rd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 26 may
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 38 and 41, while the 2^nd^ IMD products
caused by BS supporting CA of Band 26 and Band 41 may fall into the BS receive
band of Band 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 24 and 42, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27,
28, 38, 41 and 44. Note that Bands 7, 8, 20 and 38 are not intended for use in
the same geographical area as Bands 26 and 41. Therefore, sharing antenna for
CA operation between Band 26 and Band 41 is not recommended. In addition, when
one deploys CA_26-41 operation in certain region, these co-existence studies
should be taken into account because harmonics and IMDs could fall into twenty
bands in total.

##### 7.2.6.1.2.1 B26 UE receiver harmonic mixing problem
This CA combination is associated with an undesired property that the B41 UL
carrier can align with 3^rd^ order harmonic of B26 DL carrier, as shown in
Table 7.2.6.1.2.1-1, which could potentially cause B26 desensitization problem
if simultaneous Tx/Rx would be operated, due to the known harmonic mixing
problem in typical receiver design.
Table 7.2.6.1.2.1-1 B26 DL and B41 UL harmonic relation
* * *
B26 DL B26 DL x3 B41 Range (MHz) 859 - 894 2 577 - 2 682 2 496 -- 2 690
* * *
Using the commonly adopted L/H band UE reference architecture, as shown in
Figure 7.2.6.1.2.1-1, the B41 UL power at B26 LNA input is estimated to be
around -33 dBm. Considering that a typical receiver path (excluding off-chip
filters) 3^rd^ order harmonic rejection performance would not be better than
20 dB (which includes 9-dB rejection from switching mixer and less than 10 dB
from matching selectivity), the desensitization level is expected to be more
than 50 dB which can virtually nullify the receiver function. On the other
hand, if a transceiver could provide up to 20-dB 3^rd^ order harmonic
rejection, to avoid self-desensitization, the isolation from B41 PA output to
B26 LNA input will still be better than 100 dB, which likely cannot be
achieved even with additional bandpass filters cascaded before LNA.
Figure 7.2.6.1.2.1-1 UE reference architecture for self-desensitization
analysis
Although adding bandpass filters can help reduce desensitization level, it
will also introduce additional insertion loss to B26 receiver, yet the MSD is
expected to be still higher than 20 dB due to finite PCB isolation. Therefore,
it is suggested network to avoid simultaneous Tx/Rx operation when the B41 UL
and B26 DL 3^rd^ harmonic alignment condition occurs.

##### 7.2.8.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_19-42
The harmonic frequencies do not fall into the frequency ranges of both bands
as observed in table 7.2.8.1.2-1. Therefore it can be concluded that there is
no issue on harmonic interference.

Table 7.2.8.1.2-1 shows the second and third order DL harmonics and
intermodulation products when two simultaneous DLs are active in Band 19 and
Band 42.It can be seen from table 7.2.8.1.2-1 that some 2^nd^ harmonic
products of Band 19 fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9 and 10,
while some 3^rd^ harmonic products fall into the BS receive band of Bands 41.

It can be seen from table 7.2.8.1.2-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by
BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 19 and Band 42 fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 7, 38 and 41, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20,
22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43 and 44. Note that the calculation in table
7.2.8.1.2-2 (except the last row) assumes the BS transmits the whole 15 MHz DL
frequency of Band 19 and the whole 200 MHz DL frequency of Band 42. However
even if the BS only transmits up to 15 MHz DL in Band 19 and up to 20 MHz DL
in Band 42 as stated in Table 7.2.8.1.1-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 20, 22, 24, 42, 43
as shown in the last row in table 7.2.8.1.2-2.
It should be noted that Bands 4, 7, 10, 20 and 24 are not intended for use in
the same geographical area as Band 19 and Band 22 is not intended for use in
the same geographical area as Band 42. Consequently, the focus is on the IMD
products falling into Bands 3, 8, 9, 38, 41, 42 and 43, where receiver
desensitization might be an issue.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously, so the BS's own band 42
receiver and other synchronized band 42 receivers would not be interfered.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 19 and 42 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 3, 8, 9 or unsynchronized Band 38, 41, 43 BS
receivers, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 3, 8, 9 or unsynchronized
38, 41, 43 BS receivers desensitization.

##### 7.2.9.1.2 Co-existence studies for 1UL/2DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 25 and Band 41 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 7.2.9.1.2-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 7.2.9.1.2-1 that the 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 25 and Band 41 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 12, 17, 28 and 44, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 25,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 42. Note that the calculation in Table
7.2.9.1.2-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the
whole 65 MHz frequency of Band 25 and the whole 194 MHz frequency of Band 41.
If the BS is only transmitting an up to 20 MHz DL in Band 25 and Band 41 as
stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 or 35 as shown in the last row in Table
7.2.9.1.2-1. Moreover, the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS own
(up to 20 MHz) receive block within Band 25, as the transmit-receiver
frequency separation is 80 MHz.
Note that Bands 1, 7, 11, 21, 28, 33, 34, 38, 39 and 44 are not intended for
use in the same geographical area as Bands 25 and 41. Moreover, co-location of
Band 25 transmitter and Band 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-location
on adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-engineering
solutions to avoid mutual interference. Furthermore, the Band 41 BS deployed
in the same geographical area are assumed to be synchronized so that the Band
41 BS receivers will not be interfered by the Band 41 BS transmission.
Therefore, the focus here is on the IMD falling into Bands 12, 17, 22, 23, 25
and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
17, 22 or 42 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating
the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 25 and 41 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12, 17, 22 or 42 BS
receiver. But there is not a large frequency gap between Band 25 DL and Bands
23 and 25 UL, and hence Bands 23 and 25 BS receiver desensitization may still
be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 25 and 41 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 23 or 25 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, or Band 12, 17, 22 or 42 BS receiver unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Band 12, 17, 22 or 42 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the
future.
