# 4 Background
This work item presents scenarios for 3 CC downlink intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation. Two CC carrier aggregation has been a successful
mechanism to provide additional bandwidth in some cases. However, there are
still market requirements which require even higher bandwidth. The next
logical step in carrier aggregation is to aggregate 3 CCs on the downlink.
This work item proposes 3 CC intraband contiguous CA in Band 41. This work
item essentially adds a 3^rd^ DL 10/15/20 MHz component carrier to the
previously-approved 2-CC intra-band contiguous CA in Band 41. A 3^rd^ UL CC is
beyond the scope of this WID. The bandwidth options of the additional CC will
be the same range of bandwidths in the approved 2-CC B41 CA (10/15/20 MHz).
The WID for this work item was approved at RAN#61, September 2013, in
RP-131244 [2].

### 5.1.3 Channel spacing
#### 5.1.3.1 Channel spacing for intra-band contiguous CA with two or more CCs
For backwards compatibility with 2DL, the channel spacing needs to be
specified between adjacent component carriers for 3DL intra-band contiguous
CA. The same formula as for 2DL can be reused for nominal channel spacing. The
current specifications need minor modifications to specify the applicability
of the nominal channel spacing between adjacent carriers and also to include
class D. In addition, the formula can be generalized for all bandwidth classes
with two or more component carriers.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation with two or more component
carriers, the nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA component
carriers is defined as the following:
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the
adjacent E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1 in TS 36.101 with
values in MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation can be adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than the nominal
channel spacing to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.1.4 Nominal guard band
When 2DL intra-band contiguous CA was introduced, the nominal guard band was
specified as 5% of the maximum channel bandwidth of the two CCs. The guard
band is the same at both edges of the aggregated bandwidth and is equal or
larger to the guard band of each CC in a single carrier configuration. For 3DL
intra-band contiguous CA, the same symmetry principle should be kept. The
second step is to decide how to specify a symmetric nominal guard band.
In order to:
\- define symmetric guard bands at both edges of the aggregated bandwidth; and
\- ensure that the guard band for 3CCs is not less than for the 2CCs case;
\- account for the increase on the aggregated bandwidth.
The nominal guard band should be specified taking into account the maximum of
the channel bandwidth of all the CCs. This is to define the nominal guard band
as 0.05 _max_(BW~Channel(1)~, BW~Channel(2)~, BW~Channel(3)~).
Table 5.1.4-1 includes the nominal guard band for Class D.

## 5.2 Specific UE RF requirements
### 5.2.1 Reference sensitivity power level
Band 41 REFSENS was first studied based on the assumption of using a split,
overlapping filter architecture to minimize filter insertion loss and achieve
optimal performance. The dual filter architecture used an overlap of 20 MHz,
with a narrow lower sub-band filter (74 MHz) and a wide upper sub-band filter
(140 MHz). This resulted in Band 41 REFSENS relaxation of 1dB relative to the
most stringent requirements for bands like Band 1, 4, 38, etc. Yet, during the
study of 2CC intra-band contiguous CA in Band 41, it was found that the dual
filter architecture was not suitable for supporting CA without restrictions on
aggregation in the overlap region. Thus, to enable maximum flexibility of
supporting carrier aggregation, such as non-contiguous carrier aggregation or
higher orders of CC aggregation, single filter architecture was proposed and
its implication on Band 41 REFSEN was revisited. In consideration of higher
filter insertion loss of single filter over dual filter architecture, Band 41
REFSENS was further relaxed by 1 dB, allowing a 2 dB relaxation across the
whole band.
In general, TDD intra-band carrier aggregation generally does not change the
UE reference sensitivity requirement for CA. As 3DL intra-band contiguous CA
in Band 41 does not introduce any new requirements impacting CA aspects of
reference sensitivity and single filter architecture suitable for high order
of aggregation has already been accommodated in Band 41 reference sensitivity,
no changes need to be made to Band 41 REFSENS to support 3DL CA in Band 41.
Since wider baseband bandwidth is needed to accommodate wider bandwidth up to
60 MHz for 3CC CA, the performance of edge carriers may be degraded due to the
droop of baseband filter. However, as REFSENs is measured with full DL
allocation, the overall REFSEN of 3CC CA may still be maintained despite of
degradation at the edge.
### 5.2.2 Maximum input level
The maximum input level for 3DL intra-band contiguous CA is defined to keep
the same receive spectral power density as single and dual carrier
requirement, so -20.2 dBm (-25 dBm per CC) is proposed for CA bandwidth class
D. Following table is proposed in TS 36.101.

### 5.2.3 Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS)
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact on ACS when
the aggregated bandwidth is wider, the ACS requirements are scaled for the
number of component carriers. The relaxation can be revisited if the approach
of scaling up the wanted CC power according to increased BW is shown to be not
justified.

### 5.2.4 Blocking characteristics
#### 5.2.4.1 In-band blocking
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact on in-band
blocking when the aggregated bandwidth is wider, the in-band blocking
requirements are scaled for the number of component carriers. The relaxation
can be revisited if the approach of scaling up the wanted CC power according
to increased BW is shown to be not justified.

### 5.2.6 Intermodulation characteristics
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact on
intermodulation response when the aggregated bandwidth is wider, the
intermodulation requirements are scaled for the number of component carriers.
The relaxation can be revisited if the approach of scaling up the wanted CC
power according to increased BW is shown to be not justified.

## 5.3 Specific BS RF requirements
The current requirements specified in TS 36.104 and TS 36.141 for BS capable
of multi-carrier and/or CA operation in contiguous spectrum in single band are
agnostic to the number of CC supported by the BS in intra-band contiguous CA
operation, and thus can be applied for 3-CC contiguous intra-band DL CA in
Band 41. Hence no change in the BS specifications is required.
## 5.4 Specific UE RRM requirements
The RRM requirements for carrier aggregations, as specified in the
specification TS 36.133, are agnostic to specific CA combinations. Therefore,
no change to RRM requirements in the TS 36.133 specific for Band 41 3DL is
required.
