## 4.1 Band allocation plan and regulatory background
The frequency bands 1 980-2 010 MHz and 2 170-2 200 MHz was allocated for the
satellite component of IMT in most countries, while it does not preclude the
use of these bands for mobile services which are co-allocated to these bands
as primary services in the Radio Regulations.\ In fact, the Korean government
is planning to take these bands into account to use for terrestrial IMT.
Furthermore, the efficient spectrum utilization may be expected if the bands 1
980-2 010 MHz and 2 170-2 200 MHz are allocated for the mobile service because
the adjacent band 1 (1 920-1 980 MHz and 2 110-2 200 MHz) is or will be used
for LTE in several countries.
The purpose of this study item is to facilitate and harmonize the efficient
use of these bands for terrestrial IMT, especially LTE, for Korea and other
applicable countries in Region 3.
The terrestrial network equipment will adhere to all 3GPP emission masks to
protect adjacent band services.\ It is expected that the impact on the co-
existence with adjacent bands will be will be covered by this study.

# 5 Band-specific issues for LTE FDD
The covered band-specific issues for LTE FDD in the bands 1980-2010 MHz and
2170-2200 MHz are:
Study related aspects of adding a FDD band into E-UTRA that covers the
frequency range of UL: (2010-X)-2010/DL: (2220-X)-2200 MHz;
Determine parameter X (30 MHz ≦ X ≦ 70MHz with 10 MHz step);
Study coexistence issues with adjacent bands (e.g. Band 34);
Identify regulatory issues;
Study the possibility to harmonize this band.
# 6 General issues
This clause looks at the specific RF requirements for LTE UE deployment of
S-band in Korea and other applicable countries in Region 3. Consideration is
also given to the possibility of broader harmonization with Region 1.
## 6.1 Deployment scenarios
As illustrated in Figure 6.1-1, the new band under study is in the vicinity of
a number of other legacy bands already defined and possibly deployed or under
consideration for deployment in some parts of the world.\ Particularly
noteworthy is the relationship of the new band with that of Band 34 since this
presents the opportunity for UL/DL interference.
{width="5.720138888888889in" height="2.1in"}
Figure 6.1-1: Relationship of existing bands to the new band under study
Since there is no guard band between the uplink of the MSS band and Band 34
TDD, the coexistence requirements are challenging to be met without the
possibility of filter attenuation. Furthermore, it has been discussed that in
some countries, Band 34 will not be deployed and so the need to protect Band
34 does not exist.\ In other countries, Band 34 may be available for
deployment adjacent to the MSS band. To address different coexistence
protection requirements in different countries or different deployment
scenarios, NS signalling is a possible solution. For example, Band 26 was
defined to be a global band with possible deployment in several different
countries each with different coexistence requirements. Thus, NS_12, NS_13,
NS_14 and NS_15 have been defined for Band 26. There is a tradeoff, however,
between the number of NS values and tables defined and the flexibility and
optimization of requirements for any particular deployment. The goal is to
simultaneously minimize the number of NS values defined, yet maximize the
applicability of the band.
The following discrete scenarios have been identified for the 2 GHz MSS band:
  * MSS band is allocated, but Band 34 is not;
  * Band 34 is allocated, but the required protection level is still TBD;
  * Band 34 is allocated. The required protection level is anticipated.
### 6.1.1 Deployment scenarios in Korea
To the E-UTRA terrestrial only or the combined for terrestrial and satellite
service in Korea, KCC proposed to study the feasibility in new frequency band
as in Table 6.1.1-1.

Figure 6.1.1-1: Frequency band for 2.1GHz terrestrial operation in Korea
Based on the band allocation, S-band UE can coexist with UEs of the legacy
operating bands such as Band 1, 3, 5, 8, 26 and 40 as shown in Figures 6.1.1-1
and 6.1.1-2. Considering the worst coexistence case between the S-Band UE and
legacy UE, it seems necessary to limit the interference into the legacy
downlink Band 1 from new S-band UE transmission.
Figure 6.1.1-2: Other operating bands for the potential UE-to-UE coexistence
study in Korea
Figure 6.1.1-2 shows other operating bands than Band 1 deployed in Korea, in
order to verify the potential UE-to-UE coexistence problems between the new
S-band and other operating bands.
## 6.2 S-Band UE-to-UE coexistence study
As described in subclause 6.1 on the 2 GHz MSS band deployment scenarios,
there are the following discrete scenarios:
  * MSS band is allocated, but Band 34 is not;
  * Band 34 is allocated, but the required protection level is still TBD;
  * Band 34 is allocated. The required protection level is anticipated.
Each of these scenarios can be captured by utilizing NS signalling. For
example, the first scenario where Band 34 is not allocated in the same country
as the MSS band would not specify any UE coexistence requirements to protect
Band 34. This could be considered as the default UE behaviour. However, two NS
values for example could be defined for this band to correspond to the next
two scenarios. This method enables the same UE to operate in each of these
three scenarios, but to adjust its behaviour accordingly in order to provide
the greatest possibility of a harmonized design able to work in different
deployment scenarios for the benefits of larger scale and roaming.
In addition to the coexistence emission limits, some countermeasures may need
to be defined in order to enable the UE meeting the requirement. For example,
these may include A-MPR or uplink RB restrictions imposed on the MSS UE. These
are also expected to be associated with the NS value.
In this clause, the main aspect that needs to be addressed is the co-existence
of LTE UE of S-band to Band 1 UE as shown below in Figure 6.2-1
Figure 6.2-1: S-Band UE deployment scenarios for UE-to-UE coexistence
For this UE-to-UE co-existence, the deterministic approach and the UE RF
simulation approach based on band-specific RF component characteristics are
used to verify the feasibility.
### 6.2.1 Deterministic analysis for UE-to-UE coexistence
For the deterministic analysis, RAN4 assumes the following parameters:
  * Antenna and body loss : maximum 8dB per person;
  * Maximum Tx power : UE power class 3 (23dBm), consider MRP, A-MPR in Band 1;
  * Channel model : Use Free space path loss model;
  * UE to UE separation distance : ≤ 1m;
  * Desense??? less than 3dB in static condition.
Based on the above assumption, the UE-to-UE spurious emission level using
Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) can be derived:
> Required SE at Tx = allowed noise rise at Rx + MCL +penetration loss (Eq.
> 6.2.1-1)
The allowed noise rise at Rx is the estimated the interference level is
derived from Eq. 6.2.1-2, and\ the MCL level is derived from Eq. 6.2.1-3.
Allowed noise rise= -174dB/Hz + 60dB/Hz + 9dB(NF) = -105dBm/1MHz (Eq. 6.2.1-2)
MCL = path loss +Tx/Rx antenna gains = 38.44 + 8dB*2users = 54.44 dB (Eq.
6.2.1-3)
Where, path loss = 20*log10(fc[MHz])+20log10(d[m])-27.6 = 38.44dB,\ the
penetration loss is assumed to be 0dB between adjacent UEs.
By using deterministic analysis, it can be seen that the emission level is -
50.56dBm/1MHz, which is the same value as the conventional spurious emission
level in 3GPP TS 36.101 [4].
### 6.2.2 RF simulation based approach for UE-to-UE coexistence
#### 6.2.2.1 UE co-existence analysis to protect Band 1
The UL emission spectrum into Band 1 DL was simulated for single- and full-RB
allocations for 10, 15, and 20 MHz CBW. The simulation assumptions are as
follows:
  * Tx and Rx architecture: Conventional LTE Rel-8/9 UE;
  * Channel Bandwidth:
    * 10MHz, 15MHz and 20MHz;
    * No consideration of the CA scenarios.
  * Modulator impairments:
    * I/Q imbalance: 25 dBc;
    * Carrier leakage: 25 dBc;
    * Counter IM3: 60dBc.
  * PA operating point: Pout = 22dBm when full RBs allocated in Rel-8 100RB QPSK;
  * Noise Floor: -140dBm/Hz at the PA output;
  * Insertion loss: 3dB;
  * MPR/A-MPR: same value as used in Band 1;
  * Measurement BW: dBm/1MHz.

Figure 6.2.2.1-1C: Transmitter leakage at 20MHz channel BW
Figures 6.2.2.1-1A, B, C show the S-band UE Tx leakage levels into Band1 Rx UE
according to the channel bandwidth.
Figure 6.2.2.1-1C, shows that the Tx leakage level is maximum -65dBm/1MHz
which is the worst case in Band 1 UE. Since this value is below -50dBm/MHz,
there is no co-existence problem between S-band UE and Band 1 UE without any
discussion for duplexers.
#### 6.2.2.2 UE co-existence analysis to protect Band 34
##### 6.2.2.2.1 Summary results
The coexistence studies for Band 34 protection consider A-MPR or UL RB
restriction.\ In addition, PUCCH over-provisioning is also studied when A-MPR
is specified. A-MPR and UL RB restriction studies are included for different
emission protection levels for Band 34 (-50, -40, -30, and -15.5 dBm/MHz).\ In
addition, different frequency separations between the E-UTRA carrier edge and
the protected range are assumed. The results are summarized in Tables
6.2.2.2.1-1 and 6.2.2.2.1-2.

##### 6.2.2.2.2 Detailed analysis
When Band 34 and S-band are deployed in the same region, the UE-to-UE
coexistence needs to be analyzed to protect Band 34 from S-band. RF
simulations are performed on this issue considering 4 different protection
levels from -50dBm/MHz to -20dBm/MHz with 10dB step.
For the A-MPR simulation, it is assumed that the Duplexer filter attenuation
is 0dB to protect Band 34 regardless standalone bands and superset band with
Band 1. Additional simulation assumptions are as follows:
  * Modulation schemes: 16-QAM
  * ACLR requirements for E-UTRA and UTRA in TS 36.101 [4];
  * General SE/SEM for E-UTRA in TS 36.101 [4];
  * UE-to-UE coexistence requirements:
    * General UE coexistence: -50 \~ -20dBm/MHz.
Figure 6.2.2.2.2-1 shows the required A-MPR values according to the RB start
position and the number of contiguous RB size. The maximum required A-MPR
value is about 31dB in (RB_Start, RB_Length = 75, 25) case.

# 7 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
For the S-band UE channel arrangements, RAN4 agreed to study the restricted
channel arrangements as follows:
  * UL: (2010 -- X) to 2010 MHz, DL: (2200 -- X) to 2200 MHz;
  * 30 MHz ≦ X ≦ 70 with 10 MHz step;
  * The channel arrangement for the fully overlapped with Band 1 is not a candidate band due to the duplexer characteristics.
The channel arrangement for X = 30 is the same as the one originally proposed
in the SID RP-121420 [5].
## 7.1 UE Tx RF requirements
### 7.1.1 Spurious emission for UE co-existence
When S-band UE is allocated in the same country and region where Band 34 UE is
deployed, RAN4 can define network signalling such as NS_XX to apply A-MPR mask
with guard band to protect Band 34 for S-band UE.\ SE requirements for UE-to-
UE coexistence can be defined as in Table 7.1.1-1.\ The SE requirements level
and detail test methodology to protect Band 34 are for further study.

## 7.2 UE RX Requirements
### 7.2.1 REFSENS requirements for S-band UE
New S-band has the same Tx-Rx frequency separation and the total pass
bandwidth of S-band. It is similar with Band 1. Therefore S-band UE\'s REFSENS
level can be easily as assumed to be the same as that of Band 1.\ RF
simulations are provided to verify this assumption.
Figure 7.2.1-1 shows the simulation results of emission level in S-band DL
lower bands when considering 20MHz channel BW with full UL RB allocation in
upper edge of UL frequency. The red line indicates the leakage level in S-Band
DL lower band.

20MHz S-band UE (fc=2000MHz) B) 10MHz S-band UE (fc=2005MHz)
Figure 7.2.1-1: Simulation results of the Tx leakage level into S-band DL
The leakage level in DL band is about -75dBm/MHz, which is further attenuated
by Duplexer Tx/Rx isolation level, which is assumed to be 50dB. So the leakage
level in DL band is estimated as -125dBm/MHz, which is 18 dB lower than
REFSENS. Eq. 7-1 shows the impact of REFSENS in S-band DL induced by S-band Tx
leakage.
  * REFSENS for S-band UE = Conventional REFSENS + Tx_leakage levels **(Eq. 7-1)**
> = -94dBm/CBW + -125dBm/MHz;
>
> = -107dBm/MHz + -125dBm/MHz = - 106.93dBm/MHz;
>
> = **-93.93dBm/CBW.**
From Eq. 7-1, it can be seen that the REFSENS in own Rx band by Tx leakage is
negligible.
The final REFSENS is still TBD depending on the channel arrangement.
