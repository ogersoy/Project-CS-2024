# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the standards for user data transport protocols
and related signalling protocols to establish user plane transport bearers
over the S1 interface.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
below apply. Terms and definitions not defined below can be found in TR 21.905
[1].
**S1:** interface between an eNB and an EPC, providing an interconnection
point between the EUTRAN and the EPC. It is also considered as a reference
point.
**E-RAB: as defined in TS 36.401 [7]**.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR
21.905 [1].
eNB E-UTRAN Node B
EPC Evolved Packet Core
E-RAB E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearer
E-UTRAN Evolved UTRAN
GTP GPRS Tunnelling Protocol
IP Internet Protocol
TEID Tunnel Endpoint Identifier
UDP User Datagram Protocol
# 4 Data Link Layer
Any data link protocol that fulfils the requirements toward the upper layer
may be used.
# 5 S1 Interface user plane protocol
## 5.1 General
The transport layer for data streams over S1 is an IP based Transport. The
following figure shows the transport protocol stacks over S1.
Figure 6.1: Transport network layer for data streams over S1
The GTP-U (TS 29.281 [2]) protocol over UDP over IP shall be supported as the
transport for data streams on the S1 interface. The data link layer is as
specified in clause 4.
The transport bearer is identified by the GTP-U TEID (TS 29.281 [2]) and the
IP address (source TEID, destination TEID, source IP address, destination IP
address).
## 5.2 GTP-U
The GTP-U (TS 29.281 [2]) protocol shall be used over the S1 interface toward
the EPC.
## 5.3 UDP/IP
The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 [3]).
The UDP port number for GTP-U shall be as defined in TS 29.281 [2].
The eNB and the EPC shall support fragmentation and assembly of GTP packets at
the IP layer.
The eNB and the EPC shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [5]) and/or IPv4 (IETF
RFC 791 [6]).
There may be one or several IP addresses in the eNB and in the EPC. The packet
processing function in the EPC shall send downstream packets of a given E-RAB
to the eNB IP address (received in S1-AP) associated to that particular E-RAB.
The packet processing function in the eNB shall send upstream packets of a
given E-RAB to the EPC IP address (received in S1-AP) associated to that
particular E-RAB.
The Transport Layer Address signalled in S1-AP messages is a bit string of
a) 32 bits in case of IPv4 address according to IETF RFC 791 [6]; or
b) 128 bits in case of IPv6 address according to IETF RFC 2460 [5]; or
c) 160 bits if both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are signalled, in which case the
IPv4 address is contained in the first 32 bits.
## 5.4 Diffserv code point marking
IP Differentiated Services code point marking (IETF RFC 2474 [4]) shall be
supported. The mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv code points
shall be configurable by O&M based on QoS Class Identifier (QCI)
Characteristics and others E-UTRAN traffic parameters. Traffic categories are
implementation-specific and may be determined from the application parameters.
