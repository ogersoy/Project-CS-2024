# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Primary Cell:** The cell, operating on the primary frequency, in which the
UE either performs the initial connection establishment procedure or initiates
the connection re-establishment procedure, or the cell indicated as the
primary cell in the handover procedure. In this specification, Primary Cell
also refers to PSCell defined in TS 36.331 [5] unless explicitly stated
otherwise.
**Sidelink** : UE to UE interface for sidelink communication and sidelink
discovery. The Sidelink corresponds to the PC5 interface as defined in TS
23.303 [24].
**Sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct
Communication as defined in TS 23.303 [24], between two or more nearby UEs,
using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any network node.
**Sidelink discovery** : AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct Discovery as
defined in TS 23.303 [24], using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any
network node.

# 4 UE radio access capability parameters
The following subclauses define the UE radio access capability parameters and
minimum capabilities for MBMS capable UE. Only parameters for which there is
the possibility for UEs to signal different values are considered as UE radio
access capability parameters. Therefore, mandatory features without capability
parameters that are the same for all UEs are not listed here. Also
capabilities which are optional or conditionally mandatory for UEs to
implement but do not have UE radio access capability parameter are listed in
this specification.
E-UTRAN needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability parameters
when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.
All parameters shown in italics are signalled and correspond to a field
defined in TS 36.331 [5].
For optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter indicates
whether the feature has been implemented and successfully tested. For
mandatory features with the UE radio access capability parameter, the
parameter indicates whether the feature has been successfully tested.
The mandatory features required to be supported by a UE are the same for all
UE categories unless explicitly specified elsewhere in the specifications.
## 4.1 _ue-Category_
The field _ue-Category_ defines a combined uplink and downlink capability. The
parameters set by the UE Category are defined in subclause 4.2. Tables 4.1-1
and 4.1-2 define the downlink and, respectively, uplink physical layer
parameter values for each UE Category. A UE indicating category 6 or 7 shall
also indicate category 4\. A UE indicating category 8 shall also indicate
category 5. A UE indicating category 9 shall also indicate category 6 and 4. A
UE indicating category 10 shall also indicate category 7 and 4. A UE
indicating category 11 shall also indicate category 9, 6 and 4. A UE
indicating category 12 shall also indicate category 10, 7 and 4. Table 4.1-4
defines the minimum capability for the maximum number of bits of a MCH
transport block received within a TTI for an MBMS capable UE.

as described above, the carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities indicated
for a band combination is considered to meet the processing requirements if
the UE supports the maximum processing requirements defined by the UE category
assuming 20MHz channel bandwidth is supported on all bands.
The UE shall support release of any SCell without requiring reconfiguration of

per TTI
In order to help the dimensioning of the UE design, values for the maximum

values for Category 1 and 2 are same. It is not expected that category 1 UE
has to sustain the same rate of PDCP SDUs per TTI as category 2 for prolonged
period of time.
