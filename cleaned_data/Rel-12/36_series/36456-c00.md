# 4 General aspects
## 4.1 E-UTRAN UTDOA architecture
The E-UTRAN is layered into a Radio Network Layer (RNL) and a Transport
Network Layer (TNL). The E-UTRAN architecture, i.e. the E-UTRAN logical nodes
and interfaces between them, are defined as part of the Radio Network Layer.
The overall architecture for UE positioning is described in TS 36.305 [2]. The
E-UTRAN network based positioning architecture consists of a set of LMUs
(either standalone or eNB-integrated LMUs as described in TS 36.305 [2])
contained in the E-UTRAN connected to the E-SMLC in the EPC through the SLm.
This subclause specifies only the architecture of the SLm interface, and shall
not constrain the network architecture of either core or radio access
networks.
The SLm interface is specified at the boundary between the LMUs and the
E-SMLC. Figure 1 depicts the logical division of the SLm interface. From the
SLm perspective, the E-UTRAN access point is an LMU, and the EPC access point
is the E-SMLC.
Figure1 SLm Interface architecture
The E-UTRAN may thus have several SLm access points towards the EPC. As a
minimum, each SLm access point (in E-UTRAN or EPC) shall independently fulfil
the requirements of the relevant SLm specifications (36.x1x series - see
clause 7).
SLm is a logical interface.
There is only one SLm logical interface between an LMU and a given E-SMLC.
However, an LMU can be connected to multiple E-SMLCs using different logical
SLm interfaces.
## 4.2 SLm interface general principles
The general principles for the specification of the SLm interface are as
follows:
\- the SLm interface should be open;
\- the SLm interface shall support the exchange of signalling information
between the LMU and E-SMLC;
\- from a logical standpoint, the SLm is a point-to-point interface between an
LMU within the E-UTRAN and an E-SMLC in the EPC. A point-to-point logical
interface should be feasible even in the absence of a physical direct
connection between the LMU and E-SMLC.
## 4.3 SLm interface specification objectives
The SLm interface specification shall facilitate the following:
\- inter-connection of E-SMLCs with LMUs supplied by different manufacturers;
> \- separation of SLm interface Radio Network functionality and Transport
> Network functionality to facilitate introduction of future technology.
## 4.4 SLm interface capabilities
The SLm interface supports:
\- procedures to establish, maintain and release connections between the
E-SMLC and LMUs;
\- the separation of each LMU on the protocol level for specific signalling
management;
\- location services by transferring location requests from the E-SMLC to
LMUs, and UL RTOA measurements from LMUs to E-SMLC;
## 4.5 SLm interface characteristics
### 4.5.1 Use of SCTP
The SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 [7]) is used to support the exchange of SLm
Application Protocol (SLmAP) signalling messages between an LMU and an E-SMLC.
# 5 Functions of the SLm interface protocol
## 5.1 General
The following sections describe the functions to fulfil the SLm interface
capabilities.
## 5.2 SLm link management function
The SLm signalling link management function provides a reliable transfer of
the signalling between LMU and E-SMLC.
## 5.3 SLm interface management function
The error indication function is used by the LMU (respectively the E-SMLC) to
indicate to the E-SMLC (respectively the LMU) that a logical error has
occurred.
The reset procedure is used to initialize the peer entity after node setup and
after a failure event has occurred. This procedure can be initiated by the
E-SMLC or the LMU. The information about the LMU capabilities after a reset is
preserved in the E-SMLC.
The SLm Setup procedure allows the exchange of application level data, e.g.
capability, needed for the LMU and E-SMLC to interoperate correctly on the SLm
interface. This procedure is originated by the LMU only and initiates the
setup of the SLmAP contexts to the E-SMLC.
## 5.4 SLm location function
The location function is used by the E-SMLC to request the LMU to perform UL
RTOA measurements. The LMU reports UL RTOA measurements back to the requesting
E-SMLC.
# 6 SLm interface protocol structure
Editor\'s Note: Protocol Structure following the structure defined in TS
36.305 [2].
## 6.1 General
The network signalling over SLm consists of the SLm Application Protocol
(SLmAP). The SLmAP consists of mechanisms to handle all procedures between the
E-SMLC in the EPC and LMUs in the E-UTRAN.
Over the SLm interface the SLmAP protocol is, e.g., used to:
\- Request LMUs to perform UL RTOA measurements of target UE SRS
transmissions.
\- Transfer of completed UL RTOA measurements from the LMU to the E-SMLC.
## 6.2 SLmAP
Figure 6.1 shows the protocol structure for SLmAP, following the structure
described in TS 36.305 [2].
Figure 6.1: Interface protocol structure for SLmAP
The Transport Network Layer is based on IP transport, comprising SCTP on top
of IP.
