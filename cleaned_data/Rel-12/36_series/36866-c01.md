IC Interference Cancellation

ML Maximum Likelihood
# 4 Introduction
To boost capacity in coping with the exponential traffic growth, both denser
cell deployment and improved cell spectral efficiency are required. Co-channel
interference, either from inter-cell or co-scheduled intra-cell users, is
expected to become the dominant limiting factor for achieving higher network
capacity.
Historically much effort has been spent on transmission coordination to
mitigate inter-user and inter-cell interference, for example via enhanced CSI
feedback. However, one of the Rel-11 studies (Advanced Receivers) showed
promising performance gain from practical linear interference suppression (IS)
receivers that do not require any transmission coordination. Specifying
interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver UE performance requirements in
RAN4 is just a first step towards increasing the receiver role in the system
design. In another Rel-11 work item (feICIC), non-linear interference
cancellation receivers that mitigate strong CRS/PSS/SSS/PBCH interference have
been shown to provide significant gain over linear receivers.
Further enhancements to intra-cell and inter-cell interference mitigation at
the receiver side could be achieved by increasing the degree of knowledge
about interfering transmissions with possible coordination in the network. For
example, linear IS receivers and iterative/non-iterative explicit IC receivers
could be evaluated with participating transmitters coordinating and providing
side knowledge of the interference such as, but not limited to, the presence
and characteristics of interference, its transmission schemes including
resource allocation, its reference symbols for possibly enabling channel
estimation, and its modulation format and/or coding rate.
Compared to transmission-side techniques whose performance degrades under
imperfect channel knowledge at the transmitter side due to limited feedback,
IS/IC receivers can alleviate the burden of channel feedback.
Network-assisted IS/IC might require standardization effort, especially on the
signalling aspects that can enable more effective and robust UE-side
interference cancellation and/or suppression with possible network
coordination, as well as on the physical layer changes that can translate
link-level improvement of these advanced receivers to system-level capacity
gain. It is also important to study the trade-off, in terms of performance,
complexity, and signalling overhead, when enabling feasible and robust
interference cancellation/suppression at the UE side with and without network
assistance.
# 5 Study objectives
The objectives of the study item are the following:
1) (RAN1) For data/control channels of interest, identify and agree on
realistic deployment scenarios and co-channel inter- and intra-cell
interference conditions (including corresponding network/transmission
parameters) for evaluating different interference cancellation (IC) or
interference suppression (IS) receivers, including the following two main
scenarios:
\- Intra-cell interference resulted from current SU-/MU-MIMO operation
\- Inter-cell interference based on deployment scenarios prioritized in
Rel-11, taking into account scenarios, once defined, under Rel-12 WIs/SIs such
as small cells.
2) (RAN4) Identify reference IS/IC receivers with and without network
assistance, and evaluate their performance/complexity trade-off and
implementation feasibility
\- Analyze complexity and feasibility of basic receiver structures
\- Receiver structures based on linear MMSE IRC, successive interference
cancellation, and maximal likelihood detection are considered as a starting
point for reference IS/IC receivers
\- Work can be conducted in parallel to step-1
\- Based on the RAN1 scenarios agree on co-channel inter- and intra-cell
interference models for link-level simulation
\- Evaluate the link-level gain over baseline Rel-11 linear MMSE-IRC receivers
and Rel-11 non-linear receivers required for FeICIC
\- Indicate (to RAN1) assumptions on the network assistance information for
the evaluated receivers under possible network coordination
3) (RAN1) Study and evaluate the feasibility and potential system level gain
as well as specification impact of further advanced receiver:
\- Develop system level modelling methodologies for the IS/IC receivers
identified in step-2 including input from RAN4 on relevant impairments
\- Evaluate the system-level gain of advanced receivers over LTE Rel-11
receivers
\- Identify any physical layer changes and network signalling needed to
achieve the system level gain.
\- Trade-off study between gain, robustness, and signalling/coordination
complexity. If significant gain is identified for solutions with network
assistance compared to solutions without network assistance, study the system
and specification impact of network-assisted IS/IC
\- Work can start at different time for different reference receivers
NOTE 1: All evaluations shall take into account practical transmission and
feedback overhead/error/delay and realistic eNB and UE impairment modelling
including timing/frequency error and backhaul delay.
NOTE 2: The study will cover both TDD and FDD deployments, and both CRS based
transmission (including PDSCH and PDCCH) and DMRS-based transmission
(including PDSCH and EPDCCH). The study should take into account the co-
channel interference scenarios arising from homogeneous and heterogeneous
networks including small-cell related WI/SI in Rel-12.
NOTE 3: The study should consider techniques and operation scenarios in other
SI/WI (e.g., enhanced DL-MIMO, enhanced CoMP, New Carrier Type, and small cell
enhancement), and duplication of work should be avoided.
# 6 Scenarios and targeted/interference channels
## 6.1 Network deployment scenarios
The scenarios for evaluation are described in this subclause and Figure 1.
\- NAICS Scenario 1:
\- Homogeneous network, macro only, ISD = 500m
\- ITU UMa channel model
\- Non-ideal backhaul between sites (same assumptions as for SCE SI [4])
\- Coordination assumptions:
\- Intra-site information exchange is possible
\- Inter-site information exchange is subject to the backhaul latency
\- Note: This scenario is similar to CoMP scenario 1 in TR36.819 [5]
\- NAICS Scenario 2a:
\- SCE Scenario 1, with the modification that the small cell deployment is
sparse not clustered
\- Backhaul assumptions:
\- Between macro-cell and small cells within its coverage, and small nodes
under the coverage of one macro: Non-ideal
\- Between macros of different sites: Non-ideal
\- Coordination assumptions:
\- Intra-site information exchange is possible
\- Inter-site information exchange is subject to the backhaul latency
\- NAICS Scenario 2b:
\- Same as NAICS Scenario 2a, with the following exceptions:
\- Backhaul assumptions between macro and small nodes within its coverage, and
between small nodes under the coverage of one macro: "fibre access 4" as per
TR36.932 [3]
\- Coordination assumptions:
\- According to the backhaul assumptions, information exchange is possible in
the following cases:
\- Intra-site
\- Between a macro and a small node within its coverage
\- Among small nodes within the coverage of the same macro
\- According to the backhaul assumptions, the information exchange is subject
to the backhaul latency in the following cases:

## 6.2 Targeted and interference channels
It was agreed that:
\- PDSCH to PDSCH collision in situations within control channel coverage is
the first priority in frame synchronized scenario.
\- Same number of PDCCH OFDM symbols is considered.
\- This typically provides an upper bound for the performance with respect to
the control channel region size
\- With a second priority, other types of channel collisions will be
considered.
## 6.3 Intra-cell interference scenarios
### 6.3.1 SU-MIMO
Coordination and management of inter-cell interference can be effective at
cell edge. For UEs close to cell centre with relatively high SINR, other
techniques may be used to improve spectrum efficiency, e.g. SU-MIMO
techniques. In LTE, TM3/4/8/9/10 have been standardized to support various
MIMO transmissions. In particular, multiple streams can be transmitted over
the same time/frequency resources to improve spectrum efficiency. However, due
to imperfect feedback and limited codebook size, inter-stream interference can
occur and requires UE receiver to perform interference
cancellation/suppression. Advanced receivers based for example on interference
cancellation or maximum likelihood can be efficiently used to cancel the
inter-stream interference created by the non-orthogonality of the multiplexed
layers.
In order to evaluate potential gains with respect to legacy receiver structure
in the context of the study item, simulation set up for SU-MIMO tests listed
in Chapter 8.2.4 have been considered although that does not preclude the need
for additional performance requirements during the work item phase.
# 7 Receiver structures and assumptions
## 7.1 General
Various candidate receiver types, which can be divided into three categories,
are captured in the following subclauses. Each receiver type may operate under
various degrees of knowledge of interferer parameters, and each receiver type
may be applicable for dealing with inter-cell, intra-cell, and/or inter-stream
interference. **_The following_** NAICS receivers will have different trade-
off** _s_** between performance, complexity, network coordination, and network
signalling, details of which are yet to be studied.
## 7.2 Interference Suppression (IS) receivers
IS receivers refer to receivers that apply linear filtering to the received
signal to suppress the interference, as opposed to explicitly cancel the
interference. Three types of IS receivers are identified:
\- LMMSE-IRC:
\- It is baseline for Rel-11 MMSE-IRC study (refer to TR36.829).
\- No knowledge of interferer parameter(s) is required.
\- Enhanced LMMSE-IRC (E-LMMSE-IRC):
\- MMSE-IRC that explicitly considers interferer channel estimates and other
interferer knowledge.
\- Interference parameters that can enable interferer channel estimation are
needed, including, for example, its DMRS or CRS with PMI/RI.
\- Widely linear MMSE-IRC (WLMMSE-IRC):
\- WLMMSE-IRC exploits the additional degrees of freedom from the real and
imaginary part of the received signal to enhance suppression of interference
\- Real-valued modulation may be used to increase performance of the WLMMSE-
IRC receiver
## 7.3 Maximum Likelihood (ML) receivers
ML-type of receivers are non-linear in nature. Three types of ML receivers are
also identified:
\- ML:
\- Full-blown joint detection of useful and interference signals in accordance
to the ML criterion
\- Interference parameters that can enable interferer channel estimation and
interferer detection at symbol level (e.g. modulation) are needed.
\- Reduced complexity ML ([R-ML]{.underline}):
\- Reduced complexity joint detection of useful and interference modulation
symbols in accordance to the ML criterion (e.g. sphere decoding, QR-MLD, MLM,
etc.)
\- Same interference knowledge as for ML
\- Iterative ML and Iterative R-ML:
\- Iterative MAP detection and decoding of useful and interference signals.
Both successive and parallel processing implementations may be applied.
\- In addition to the interference knowledge needed for ML, interference
knowledge that can enable code word demodulation and decoding is needed.
\- Additionally, assumptions on network coordination may be necessary.
## 7.4 Interference Cancellation (IC) receivers
IC-type of receivers are also non-linear in nature. Four types of IC receivers
are identified
\- Linear Code word level SIC ([L-CWIC]{.underline}):
\- receiver utilizing successive application of [linear detection (e.g.:
LMMSE-IRC)]{.underline}, decoding, re-encoding, and cancellation
\- May have iteration (e.g. Turbo L-CWIC)
\- May utilize CRC check (e.g. hard L-CWIC)
\- Same interference knowledge as Iterative ML and Iterative R-ML.
Additionally, interferer RNTI knowledge may be needed.
\- Additionally, assumptions on network coordination may be necessary.
\- ML-CWIC:
\- receiver utilizing successive application of [ML or reduced complexity ML
detection]{.underline}, decoding, re-encoding, and cancellation
\- May have iteration (e.g. Turbo ML-CWIC)
\- May utilize CRC check (e.g. hard ML-CWIC)
\- Same interference knowledge as L-CWIC
\- Additionally, assumptions on network coordination may be necessary.
\- Symbol level IC ([SLIC]{.underline}):
\- successive cancellation receiver utilizing successive application of linear
detection, reconstruction, and cancellation
\- May have iteration
\- Same interference knowledge as ML/R-ML.
\- Parallel interference cancellation ([PIC]{.underline}):
\- Parallel IC as opposed to successive IC, otherwise similar to SIC
\- PIC receivers can be categorized into L-CW-PIC, ML-CW-PIC or SL-PIC similar
to SIC
## 7.5 Receiver assumptions
Synchronous network deployment is assumed for NAICS receivers in the study
phase. Receiver performance degradation from timing and frequency
synchronization error, as well as under asynchronous deployment, is for future
study.
Subframe/slot alignment is considered to be a reasonable receiver assumption
in synchronous network. Additionally CP is considered to be aligned in the
analysis. This could be achieved, if needed, with e.g. some network
coordination effort.
Aligned PDCCH region is agreed as the first priority of the study item. The
performance impact of misaligned control channel regions (i.e., misaligned
starting symbol of PDSCH) depends on the receiver types, as well as whether
the desired PDSCH is under the interference of only PDSCH or both PDSCH and
PDCCH. In the latter case, the interference characteristics on overlapped REs
can be different from other REs due to the different resource mapping of
PDCCH, the transmission power, transmission scheme, etc. For receivers that
explicitly decode and cancel the interfering PDSCH, the knowledge of the
starting symbol (i.e., CFI) is required. Performance under misaligned control
regions and whether network signaling or UE detection of interference PCFICH
is needed, are for future study.
All NAICS receivers require per-subcarrier interference channel estimation.
Note that WLMMSE-IRC operates similarly as the baseline LMMSE-IRC (i.e.,
without per-subcarrier interference channel knowledge) with the main
difference on the WLMMSE-IRC's requirement of PAM modulation on dominant
interferers. But WLMMSE-IRC could benefit from per-subcarrier channel
knowledge in the same way as E-LMMSE-IRC. To estimate the interference
channel, the RS of the interferers needs to be known to the UE, which means
the following parameters:
\- For CRS-based TM of interferers: cell ID, number of CRS ports, PMI (TM4
&6), RI (TM3 &4), data RE to CRS EPRE ratio
\- For DMRS-based TM of interferers: cell ID or (when configured), number of
DMRS ports (i.e., RI), n~SCID,~ P~B~ (on OFDM symbols containing CRS)
Further study is required on what parameters could be blindly estimated and
corresponding performance impact due to detection robustness, and on when
signalling will be beneficial with/without network coordination to reduce
signalling overhead. If further cancellation of a reference signal is found
useful in future studies, such as CRS cancellation even for DMRS-based TMs,
CSI-RS cancellation, and so on, the corresponding reference signal
configuration parameters may also be needed.
The knowledge of interference presence is needed for NAICS receivers at each
PRB (in the case of VRB) or PRB pair, similarly for TM (expect for LMMSE-IRC
and WLMMSE-IRC receivers). It may be obtained from network
signaling/coordination or UE blind detection or a combination of the two, and
further study is needed in the future.
The modulation order of an interfering PDSCH is required for all receivers
except for LMMSE-IRC and E-LMMSE-IRC receivers on a per-PRB level, obtained
from network signaling/coordination or UE blind detection or a combination of
the two, and further study is needed in the future.
MCS and RNTI information is required to decode the interference PDSCH for
L-CWIC, ML-CWIC, and iterative (R)-ML receivers. If interference PDSCH is a
HARQ retransmission, RV information is required additionally. UE detection of
these parameters is not feasible without decoding the interference PDCCH, and
signaling of RNTI and MCS may require additional overhead. Network
coordination such as the use of aligned resource allocation could reduce
receiver complexity and/or signaling overhead, but with scheduling constraints
which may impact neighbor cell performance. This is for future study.
WLMMSE-IRC brings the most benefit when the dominant interferers use PAM,
instead of QPSK/QAM as used in the current LTE air interface and assumed by
all other NAICS receivers. Such operation may or may not need to be signaled.
## 7.6 Complexity analysis
[Conclusion:]{.underline}
**Some network assistance/coordination can reduce receiver complexity compared
to requiring UE to blindly detect all the interference parameters.**
But there is no consensus on the feasibility and performance of blind
detection receivers and **it is agreed that RAN4 should study the performance
and complexity of blind detection of interference parameters, including which
parameters to be blindly estimated by the UEs**.
\- Focus on the interference parameters identified in the receiver assumption
section, generally including:
\- high-layer configured parameters (e.g., TM, cell ID, MBSFN subframes, CRS
antenna ports, P~A~, P~B~, data-to-CRS power ratio).
\- UE-specific configuration parameters can become dynamic depending on the UE
dynamically scheduled in the interference cells.
\- Cell-specific parameters may also be different depending on the dynamic
presence/absence of the interference
\- dynamically signalled parameters (e.g., CFI, PMI, RI, MCS, modulation
order, resource allocation, DMRS ports, used in TM10)
Company input on the complexity analysis can be found in R4-136979 [13].
# 8 Link-level performance evaluation
## 8.1 Interference modelling
### 8.1.1 General
In this subclause, the interference models/profiles are developed in order to
assess the link level performance of NAICS receivers under realistic non full-
buffer traffic. A number of interferers are explicitly modelled in link
simulation based on a certain ON/OFF pattern and at several settings of SINRs
and I~k~/N~oc~ where N~oc~ is defined based on the resource utilization factor
α.
For scenario #1, two interferers will be explicitly modelled and all cells are
assumed to have the same α value and N~oc~ is defined as:
The same methodology applies to both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. While this
methodology models accurately the interference scenario seen in Scenario 1, in
case of Scenario 2 this can be considered as a simplified method which may not
accurately represent the realistic interference conditions. For scenario #2,
it was observed that the RU factor for macro cell and small cell can be
substantially different (note that 40% and 60% being the RU factor associated
to the most loaded layer (i.e., the macro cell). The impact of different RU on
the N~oc~ level depends on the percentage of non dominant interference coming
from the macro cell. In Scenario 2 it may be a reasonable assumption to
consider a higher percentage of non dominant interference coming from the
macro cell which results in a limited difference in N~oc~ under different RU
or under the same RU. Additionally, according to this simplified method, no
differentiation is provided in terms of macro or small cell dominant
interference levels and only I~1~/N~oc~(α) and I~2~/N~oc~(α) are provided
independently on whether these dominant interferers are macro cells or small
cells.
### 8.1.2 Settings of SINR and I~k~/N~oc~
#### 8.1.2.1 Geometry (SINR) calibration
To determine the SINR of interest, geometry calibration under full buffer is
conducted based on the system assumptions in Annex-A with further
clarifications on the HO margin of 3dB and small-cell radius of 40m.

#### 8.1.2.2 Settings of **I~k~/N~oc~ (scenario 1)**
For link level simulation in scenario-1, three ranges of SINRs, defined under
full loading as SINR=E~s~/[I~1~+I~2~+N~oc~(α=1)], are identified as the SINRs
of interest (i.e., 5-25%, 40-60%, and 75-95%). For each SINR range, three
values for I~1~/N~oc~(α) are defined, corresponding to 20/50/80%-tile points
based on the distribution of I~1~/N~oc~(α). Note that the distribution of
I~1~/N~oc~(α) is obtained from all the UEs in that SINR range and N~oc~(α) is
obtained as . For each of the three I~1~/N~oc~(α) values at 20/50/80%-tile,
both the mean and median of the conditioned I~2~/N~oc~(α) were obtained and
compared, where the mean/median I~2~/N~oc~(α) is obtained from all
I~2~/N~oc~(α) whose corresponding I~1~/N~oc~(α) fall within ±5%-tile of
20/50/80% (i.e., 15\~25%, 45\~55%, 75\~85%).
The results are captured below:

Since the difference between I~1~/N~oc~(α) and I~2~/N~oc~(α) is similar for
α=40% and 60%, 40% was chosen to be the mandatory simulation case and 60% as
optional.
#### 8.1.2.3 Settings of **I~k~/N~oc~ (scenario 2)**
Same as scenario #1, for link level simulation three ranges of SINRs, defined
under full loading as SINR=E~s~/[I~1~+I~2~+N~oc~(α=1)], are identified as the
SINRs of interest (i.e., 5-25%, 40-60%, and 75-95%). For each SINR range,
three values for I~1~/N~oc~(α) are defined, corresponding to 20/50/80%-tile
points based on the distribution of I~1~/N~oc~(α). Note that the distribution
of I~1~/N~oc~(α) is obtained from all the UEs in that SINR range and N~oc~(α)
is obtained as . For each of the three I~1~/N~oc~(α) values at 20/50/80%-tile,
both the mean and median of the conditioned I~2~/N~oc~(α) were obtained and
compared, where the mean/median I~2~/N~oc~(α) is obtained from all
I~2~/N~oc~(α) whose corresponding I~1~/N~oc~(α) fall within ±5%-tile of
20/50/80% (i.e., 15\~25%, 45\~55%, 75\~85%).
The results are captured below:

## 8.2 Link-level Performance Characterization
The link-level performance evaluation was conducted in two phases:
\- Phase-1: Fixed on/off pattern for interference
\- Phase-2: Dynamic on/off pattern according to the on/off modelling and with
link adaptation
### 8.2.1 Phase-1 link-level Evaluation Results (Fixed ON/OFF)
For phase-1 evaluation, the following fixed ON/OFF patterns of the two
explicitly modelled interferers are used. Note that when on, the interferer is
assumed to be fully loaded and when off, the interferer is assumed to transmit
CRS.
\- On/On
\- On/Off
Some assumptions used for phase-1 evaluation are listed in the following while
companies can capture additional assumptions associated with their results in
the footnote of tables.
\- SINR, I1/Noc(α), and I2/Noc(α) follow the geometry setting as agreed for
scenario #1 and #2 respectively
\- Wideband PMI for serving and interference cell
\- Fixed across entire frequency band
\- Varies randomly from subframe to subframe for interfering cells, fixed
across subframes for serving cell
\- Fixed MCS/RI of serving and interference cell
Company phase-1 results are provided in R4-136977 [14].
Observations from phase-1 results:
\- E-LMMSE-IRC/SL-IC/R-ML/CWIC all achieve noticeable performance gain over
R.11 LMMSE-IRC receiver in most scenarios , and the gains depend on the
different interference profiles:
\- Larger gain for stronger interference
\- Additionally for SL-IC/R-ML, the gains depend on modulation order. The
largest performance gains are observed when interference signal is modulated
by QPSK
\- For CWIC, the gains depend on MCS.
\- Performance gains for TM4 in non colliding CRSs are considerably smaller
than those under colliding CRS, due to worse performance of the baseline
LMMSE-IRC receiver in the colliding CRS scenario (i.e. incorrect interference
covariance matrix estimation).
### 8.2.2 Phase-2 link-level evaluation results (Dynamic ON/OFF)
Phase-2 evaluation focus on receiver throughput under dynamic interference
condition as a result of non-buffer traffic typically.
#### 8.2.2.1 Dynamic ON/OFF modelling
Interference characteristics highly depend on the dynamic scheduling behavior
in neighboring cells in reaction to the packet arrival process. The general
model is described in the following steps where a few simplifications are made
in the development of dynamic on/off model:
\- Interference has a constant MCS/RI across the time and frequency domain for
the duration of each packet
Note: This simplified model is adopted for link level evaluation in the study
item phase. System level simulation will have realistic interference MCS/RI
that varies during each packet, and another model (e.g., Random MCS/RI across
subframe and/or subband for the duration of each packet) should be considered
for test definition in later Work Item phase, in order to test the robustness
of the receivers.
\- MCS/RI are randomly assigned for each interference cell FTP packet in
accordance to agreed probability distributions (described later in Table 14)
\- Same MCS levels are used for both codewords in case of RI = 2
\- Different MCS/RI distributions may be used for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2a/b
studies
\- Different MCS/RI distributions may be used for 40% and 60% Rus
\- Same MCS/RI distributions are used for studies of different SINR regions,
I/Noc percentile points and TMs
\- The packet duration corresponding to the i-th MCS level within the
determined set of MCS levels can be derived as , based on
\- 0.5 Mbytes packet size (i.e. 4194304 bits)
\- Average retransmission rate (_ReTx_), obtained from the statistics observed
in system level simulation
\- TBS corresponding to the i-th MCS, assuming 10MHz bandwidth
\- Based on the previously-determined MCS/RI distribution, calculate the
average packet duration _D_ as where the packet level MCS/RI probability for
the i-th MCS/RI is derived from TTI(subframe)-level MCS/RI distribution
observed in system level simulation and packet duration , i.e.,
\- Packet arrival is a Poisson process with a packet arrival rate defined as
_λ= RU/D_
\- If the newly arriving packet arrive earlier before the old packet
transmission is finished, it will be queued in the buffer until the old packet
transmission is finished
\- The interference is off if the buffer is empty
Basically, the MCS/RI distribution will determine the on/off behavior. Hence,
companies were recommended to provide calibration data on the following:
\- TTI level MCS/RI probability
\- Median MCS for each modulation/RI set
\- Average HARQ transmission times per packet
\- Packet arrival rate corresponding to the target RU level (40% or 60%)
The following system level simulation assumptions were used to derive the
above information:
\- RAN1 agreed SLS assumption as baseline (see appendix)
\- Bandwidth: 10MHz
\- Packet scheduler: 1 UE per TTI
\- BLER target: 10% after 1st transmission
\- Packet Size: 0.5Mbytes
\- CFI = 2
Before companies can generate MCS/RI distributions based on the above system
level simulations, the following working assumption for scenario #1 40% RU was
also agreed to allow companies enough time to generate phase-2 results.
\- Working assumptions on MCS/RI distributions for Scenario #1, 40% RU
\- RI=1/2 is randomly chosen according to 55%/ 45% probability
\- RI=1: MCS 7 (17%), MCS 15 (22%), MCS 22 (16%)
\- RI=2: MCS 7 (11%), MCS 14 (16%), MCS 22 (18%)
\- Average packet duration D is 289 ms (based on ReTx = 1)
\- Packet arrival rate λ= 1.384
Based on company inputs compiled in Table 12, where the probabilities for
QPSK/16QAM/64QAM for both rank-1 and rank-2 were tabulated, the averaged
probabilities and the averaged MCS level (rounded to be nearest valid MCS
level) were chosen as below.

#### 8.2.2.2 Phase-2 link-level evaluation results
The phase-2 evaluation was performed under the following assumptions:
\- Full buffer traffic assumption on the desired cell
\- FIFO FTP packet scheduler should be used for the studies
\- If the newly arriving packet arrive earlier before the old packet
transmission is finished, it will be queued in the buffer until the old packet
transmission is finished.
\- Adopt the following CQI, PMI and RI feedback approach in the study for the
desired cell
\- Companies are encouraged to specify the approach to compute CSI (CQI, RI,
PMI) used for link-level studies (e.g. LMMSE-IRC based)
\- OLLA is used for MCS adaptation
\- Performance metrics
\- Baseline: Throughput gain vs. the baseline LMMSE-IRC receiver
\- Optional: User perceived packet throughput
\- For serving cell, every 0.5 Mbytes is treated as a FTP packet.
\- UPT is calculated for each FTP packet and defined as packet size
(0.5Mbytes) divided by the corresponding consumed packet transmission time.
Company results are included in R1-141002 [15].
Observations from phase-2 results:
\- E-LMMSE-IRC/SL-IC/R-ML/CWIC all achieve noticeable performance gain over
R.11 LMMSE-IRC receiver in most scenarios , and the gains depend on the
different interference profiles:
\- Larger gain for stronger interference
\- SL-IC/R-ML has larger gain compared to E-LMMSE-IRC in many cases with
genie-aided information
\- Single company results indicated that blind SL-IC/R-ML also provide large
gain compared to E-LMMSE-IRC. But there is no consensus on the feasibility and
performance of blind detection receivers
\- Performance gains for TM4 in non colliding CRSs are considerably smaller
than those under colliding CRS, due to worse performance of the baseline
LMMSE-IRC receiver in the colliding CRS scenario (i.e. incorrect interference
covariance matrix estimation).
### 8.2.3 Preliminary link-level evaluation results with blind detection of
interference parameters
The performance and complexity study is still ongoing and the [current
status]{.underline} is:
\- There is no consensus on the feasibility and performance of blind detection
receivers.
\- Varying degree of performance degradation from minimal to noticeable,
comparing blind detection receivers with genie-aided receivers, also depending
on operation assumptions.
Individual company analysis so far can be found in below, with these
preliminary observations:
\- R4-135099, \"Performance of blind detection of modulation order for R-ML
receivers,\" MediaTek
\- Observations: There are many interference-related parameters to estimate
(if not provided by eNB), the contribution focused only on the blind
estimation of interference presence (i.e., whether there is any PDSCH
scheduled/allocated at interfering cells) at each PRB and the modulation
order. Other parameters such as TM are assumed known and in particular, both
desired and interference PDSCH uses TM9 in the evaluation. Varying degree of
performance degradation are observed (up to 3dB) compared with known
interference presence/absence and modulation order.
**\- R4-134651, "Discussion on potential blind detection/estimation of
parameters for NAICS", Ericsson**
\- Observations: RI/PMI and TM parameters can be potentially estimated by the
UE based on analysis of interference signal. Reliability of the estimation can
be further studied in terms of impact of blind detection on the overall
performance. As a matter of example initial simulation results based on TM4
and TM9 for low SINR region and medium interference percentile show small
degradation of the performance compared to genie aided receiver due to TM, RI
and PMI estimation. Further studies and alignment is needed to quantify the
expected loss by blindly estimating parameters.
\- R4-136207, "Discussion on interference parameters signaling and detection
for NAICS", Intel Corporation
\- Observations: The performance of the enhanced IS/IC receivers degrades in
case of using blind interference parameters detection comparing with the full
network assistance scenario thus diminishing the potential gains of the
enhanced IS/IC receivers. More comprehensive further studies on the impact of
the blind detection of the interference signal parameters are required.
\- Using blind detection of interference signal modulation format may result
in noticeable performance degradation comparing with the full network
assistance scenario in case of QAM16 and QAM64 interference.
\- Using blind detection of spatial precoding scheme for the TM4 interference
(i.e. PMI/RI) may result in substantial performance degradation comparing with

interference for 2x2 systems and in case of 4x2 systems.

\- Observations: Link level evaluations are provided for fully blind SLIC/R-ML
receivers that detect all interferers parameters needed including modulation,
RI, PMI, EPRE (TPR), TM etc. Evaluations for TM4 and TM3 scenarios show that
fully blind SLIC/blind R-ML receivers provide significant gains over the
baseline Rel-11 receiver, and in many cases show negligible degradation to the
genie aided receiver. Given the performance of blind receivers and
considerations of signaling overhead, additional network coordination /
signaling should be considered only if significant system level gain is shown
over blind receivers.

#### 8.2.4.2 Summary
From the summary of the link level simulation results above, we conclude that
further advanced receiver based on IC/ML without the need for network
assistance can provide significant gains (e.g. up to 5dB depending on the
receiver structure and the test cases) compared to legacy baseline receivers
such as MMSE-IRC and MMSE when applied to SU-MIMO scenarios listed above (i.e.
the goal is to cancel the inter stream intra cell interference).
# 9 System-level performance evaluation
## 9.1 System-level modelling methodologies
For the identified receiver types, system-level modelling methodologies are
described in this subclause based on company provided TPs. These methods are
used by companies to produce the system level evaluation results. Many
proposals captured here are validated [8\~12] by comparing the predicted BLER
performance with that of the actually simulated performance under various
channels.
Another alternative for system-level evaluation could be based on using the
embedded link-level receiver model. In such approach the system-level
simulator is responsible for the resource, MCS, beamforming assignment and
generation of the interference from the neighboring cells, while the link-
level simulator is used for the explicit modelling of the actual packet
transmission and reception for the generated interference environment. It is
expected that such simulation approach may provide more confidence in the
evaluation results.
### 9.1.1 Modelling methodologies for E-LMMSE-IRC
**Alternative 1**
Assuming that a single dominant interferer is taken into account explicitly at
the receiver, the following signal model is considered:
* * *
, (9.1)
* * *
where _z_ is the interference from non-dominant interferers and noise term,
and _v_ is the total interference and noise term.
The E-LMMSE-IRC receiver is expressed as
$W = {\hat{H}}_{0}^{H}\left( {\hat{H}}_{0}{\hat{H}}_{0}^{H} +
{\hat{H}}_{1}{\hat{H}}_{1}^{H} + {\hat{R}}_{z} \right)^{- 1}$, (9.2)
where ${\hat{R}}_{z}$ is the estimate of other cell interference and noise
covariance, that is $R_{z} = E\left\lbrack \text{zz}^{H} \right\rbrack$.
Therefore, the system level modelling of E-LMMSE-IRC consists of modelling the
estimation of _H_ ~0~, _H_ ~1~, and _R_ ~z~.
The other cell interference and noise covariance estimate ${\hat{R}}_{z}$ may
be modelled using the complex Wishart distribution, so that
${\hat{R}}_{z}$ \~ $\text{CWishart}\left( R_{z},N_{\text{eff}} \right)$, (9.3)
The model assumes that the receiver has ideal interference samples available
for estimation of the interference covariance terms. In practice the receiver
may obtain interference samples by subtracting the estimated received
reference signal from the total received signal, and then forming the
covariance estimates as sample covariance matrix of the residual signal. In
this case, the channel estimation error is impacting the covariance matrix
estimation accuracy, which may be further taken into account in the model.
[Channel estimation error modelling]{.underline}
For the baseline LMMSE-IRC receiver, only the estimate of the desired channel
_H_ ~0~ is required. In case of E-LMMSE-IRC receiver, both the desired and the
interferer channels are required. The equivalent channels may be estimated
jointly at the UE, which is assumed to give significant improvement to the
receiver performance in case the reference signals of the desired and
interfering transmissions are overlapping. Different error modelling
methodologies may be employed.
In case it is assumed that the estimation errors of the channels may be
modelled assuming complex normal distributed signals, the estimation error of
equivalent channels is complex normal distributed. Assuming further that the
channel estimation comprises averaging over a set of reference symbols (in
practice weighted averages are used) the equivalent channel estimate may be
expressed for the baseline LMMSE-IRC receiver as
${\hat{H}}_{0}$\~$\text{CN}\left( H_{0},\frac{1}{N_{\text{eff},h}}R_{v}
\right)$, (9.4)
Similarly, for the E-LMMSE-IRC the equivalent channel estimate may be
expressed as
${\hat{H}}_{i}$\~$\text{CN}\left( H_{i},R_{e,i} \right)$, (9.5)
where $R_{e,i}$ is the channel estimation error covariance which is a function
of the other cell interference and noise covariance and also the equivalent
channel of the signal that is interfering with the channel that is to be
estimated, i.e.,
$R_{e,i} = f\left( R_{z},H_{i} \right)$, (9.6)
where $H_{i}$ is $H_{0}$ when forming ${\hat{H}}_{1}$, and $H_{1}$ when
forming ${\hat{H}}_{0}$.
As an example, in case there is no interference cancelation or joint
estimation of the channels $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$, the function _f_ may be chosen
as
$f\left( R_{z},H_{i} \right) = \frac{1}{N_{\text{eff},h}}\left( R_{z} +
H_{i}H_{i}^{H} \right)$, (9.7)
where $N_{\text{eff},h}$ is the effective number of samples in channel
estimation averaging. As another example, in case ideal joint estimation of
$H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$, the function _f_ may be chosen as
$f\left( R_{z},H_{i} \right) = \frac{1}{N_{\text{eff},h}}R_{z}$, (9.8)
that is, the channel estimation error has the same covariance for both $H_{0}$
and $H_{1}$, and depends only on the other cell interference covariance. In
practice $N_{\text{eff},h}$ relates to how the channel estimation filter is
constructed.
**Alternative 2**
The modelling methodologies described in Section 9.1.5 for SLIC are also
applicable to E-LMMSE-IRC and follow directly by omitting the interference
cancellation loop over signals being cancelled. The methodology used in
Alternative 3 in Section 9.1.5 includes the channel and noise estimation of
the link-level implying that channel estimation error are not modelled as in
Alternative 1 above .
### 9.1.2 Modelling methodologies for WLMMSE-IRC
This subclause defines system level modelling for the WLMMSE-IRC receiver by
starting from definition of general linear model and then defining the SINR
calculation including modelling of estimation errors at the system level.
Finally, the methodology is summarized.
A general linear model may be defined, where the received signal is given by:
(9.9)
The linear model can be rewritten in augmented form as:
$r^{A} = H_{0}^{A}x_{0}^{A} + n^{A}$ (9.10)
$r^{A} = \begin{bmatrix} I\left( r \right) \ Q\left( r \right) \
\end{bmatrix}$ (9.11)
$H_{0}^{A} = \begin{bmatrix} I\left( H_{0} \right) & \- Q\left( H_{0} \right)
\ Q\left( H_{0} \right) & I\left( H_{0} \right) \ \end{bmatrix}$ (9.12)
$x_{0}^{A} = \begin{bmatrix} I\left( x_{0} \right) \ Q\left( x_{0} \right) \
\end{bmatrix}$ (9.13)
$n^{A} = \begin{bmatrix} I\left( n \right) \ Q\left( n \right) \
\end{bmatrix}$ (9.14)
where all variables are real valued. Note that the interference vector **n**
can be colored and operators I(·) and Q(·) take the real and imaginary parts
of their arguments. As for any LMMSE receiver, the symbol estimate of the
WLMMSE-IRC receiver equals:
* * *
     (9.15)
* * *
where the matrices ${\hat{C}}_{\text{rr}}^{A}$**,** ${\hat{H}}_{0}^{A}$ and
${\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A}$ are estimates of covariance of the received
signal, the channel and the covariance of transmitted symbols, respectively.
The matrix ${\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A}$ is related to the selected modulation
in the serving cell and is known by the UE through signalling. In other words,
${\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A} = 0\text{.}5\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \ 0 & I \
\end{bmatrix}$ if QAM modulation is transmitted
And
${\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A} = \begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \ 0 & 0 \ \end{bmatrix}$ if
PAM modulation is transmitted.
There are two main issues in the system modelling methodology that needs to be
solved. First, assuming system simulations are performed by using SINR to
packet error rate mapping, the calculation of the SINR at the output of the
receiver needs to be defined. Secondly, if practical non-idealities are to be
taken into account, estimation errors need to be modelled.
[Calculation of post-equalization SINR]{.underline}
Considering first the post-equalization SINR calculation, let us define:
a) The usefull signal contribution at the output of the receiver filter:
$\begin{bmatrix} \Psi_{I} \ \Psi_{Q} \ \end{bmatrix} = E\left\lbrack
\text{diag}\left( g\left( H_{0}^{A}x_{0}^{A} \right)\left( H_{0}^{A}x_{0}^{A}
\right)^{T}g^{T} \right) \right\rbrack = \text{diag}\left( g\left( H_{0}^{A}
\right)\ C_{\text{xx}}^{A}\left( H_{0}^{A} \right)^{T}g^{T} \right)$ (9.16)
b) The interference contribution at the output of the receiver filter:
$\begin{bmatrix} \xi_{I} \ \xi_{Q} \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \xi_{1} \
\vdots \ \xi_{n} \ \end{bmatrix}$ (9.17)
Where
$\begin{matrix} \xi_{i} = E\left\lbrack g\left( i\text{,:} \right)\left(
\left( H_{0}^{A}x_{0}^{A'} \right)\left( H_{0}^{A}x_{0}^{A'} \right)^{T} +

+ g\left( i\text{,:} \right)\ C_{\text{nn}}^{A}g^{T}\left( i\text{,:} \right)
\ \end{matrix}$ (9.18)
The matrix $C_{\text{xx},i}^{A'}$ equals the covariance of the transmitted
signal where the i:th diagonal element is zeroed out like in MIMO systems.
Finally, the SINR of the received and filtered output symbol in the case of
real valued modulation where e.g. a PAM modulated symbol is mapped to the I
branch equals

     (9.19)

where the division is computed element wise. If complex valued modulation e.g.
QAM have been transmitted one can combine the real and imaginary part and
obtain the SINR of the complex symbol (assuming element wise division) as
* * *
     (9.20)
* * *
Because e.g. for scalar ${\hat{x}}_{0} = I\left( {\hat{x}}_{0} \right) +
\text{jQ}\left( {\hat{x}}_{0} \right)$, ${\hat{x}}_{0} = {\hat{x}}_{r} + n_{r}
+ j\left( {\hat{x}}_{q} + n_{q} \right)$ and
$= E\left\lbrack {\hat{x}}_{r}\left( {\hat{x}}_{r} \right)^{} \right\rbrack +
E\left\lbrack {\hat{x}}_{q}\left( {\hat{x}}_{q} \right)^{} \right\rbrack +
E\left\lbrack n_{r}\left( n_{r} \right)^{} \right\rbrack + E\left\lbrack
n_{q}\left( n_{q} \right)^{} \right\rbrack$ (9.21)
[Modeling of Estimation Errors]{.underline}
As mentioned in the previous subclause, information on matrices
${\hat{C}}_{\text{rr}}^{A}$**,** ${\hat{H}}_{0}^{A}$ and
${\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A}$ is required by the receiver. The matrix
${\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A}$ depends on the applied modulation format at the
serving cell, which is signaled over PDCCH. Hence, no additional error model
is needed in relation to ${\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A}$. The channel estimate
${\hat{H}}_{0}^{A}$ can be estimated in complex domain as in the conventional
system e.g. from DM-RS. Hence, generation of channel estimation error is not
discussed in this paper. However, the covariance of the received signal
${\hat{C}}_{\text{rr}}^{A}$ needs to be calculated in augmented real valued
format. In this document we assume DM-RS based covariance estimation.
Earlier studies, as in [6], have used estimation error model based on Wishart
random matrices and the extension to augmented matrices is now discussed
further.
Assuming ${\hat{C}}_{\text{rr}}^{A} =
{\hat{H}}_{0}^{A}{\hat{C}}_{\text{xx}}^{A}\left( {\hat{H}}_{0}^{A} \right)^{H}
+ {\hat{C}}_{\text{ii}}^{A}$ one can focus on estimating the covariance of
interference ${\hat{C}}_{\text{ii}}^{A}$ from the residual signal obtained by
subtracting the serving cell DM-RS pilot replica **_p_** from the received
signal. In other words, the residual signal at the DM-RS RE positions is
calculated following a sample covariance matrix calculation i.e.
$\left\lbrack r^{A}\left( n \right) - {\hat{H}}_{0}^{A}\begin{bmatrix} I\left(
p\left( n \right) \right) \ Q\left( p\left( n \right) \right) \
\end{bmatrix},\ \cdots\ ,r^{A}\left( n + N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}} \right) -
{\hat{H}}_{0}^{A}\begin{bmatrix} I\left( p\left( n + N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}}
\right) \right) \ Q\left( p\left( n + N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}} \right)
\right) \ \end{bmatrix} \right\rbrack^{T}$ (9.22)
As also discussed in [6] the matrix ${\hat{C}}_{\text{ii}}^{A}$ may be
modelled as a Wishart distributed random matrix i.e.
${\hat{C}}_{\text{ii}}^{A}\text{\textasciitilde}W_{n}(N_{\text{DM} -
\text{RS}},C_{\text{ii}}^{A})$which is based on the ideal information on the
interference covariance matrix $C_{\text{ii}}^{A} = C_{\text{rr}}^{A} -
H_{0}^{A}C_{\text{xx}}^{A}(H_{0}^{A})^{T}$which should easily be available in
system level simulators.
The Wishart distributed random matrix can be generated from ideal information
i.e. ${\hat{C}}_{\text{ii}}^{A} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{DM} -
\text{RS}}}\text{QAA}^{T}Q^{T}$ where [6]
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---+ | $Q = \text{chol}(C_{\text{ii}}^{A})$ (9.23) | | | | | | $A = \begin{bmatrix} | | | \sqrt{c_{1}} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \ | | | n_{\text{21}} & \sqrt{c_{2}} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \ | | | n_{\text{31}} & n_{\text{32}} & \sqrt{c_{3}} & \cdots & 0 \ | | | \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \ | | | n_{N1} & n_{N2} & n_{N3} & \cdots & \sqrt{c_{N}} \ | | | \end{bmatrix}$ (9.24) | | | | | | $c_ | | | {i} = \chi^{2}\left( N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}} - i - 1 \right)$ | | | (9.25) | | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+---+
Note that the matrix is real valued in this case. Considering the number of
samples for estimation, one can assume that e.g. DM-RS REs from one PRB pair
are used for each estimate where N~DM-RS~ = 12.
In summary, the link abstraction method consists of the following steps in the
system modelling methodology to calculate modulation specific post-
equalization SINR at the output of the WLMMSE-IRC receiver including practical
non-idealities:
\- Generate serving cell channel matrix $H_{0}^{A}$ and interference
covariance matrix $C_{\text{ii}}^{A}$ samples
\- Add channel estimation error and calculate ${\hat{H}}_{0}^{A}$.
\- Generate estimated interference covariance matrix
${\hat{C}}_{\text{ii}}^{A}$ by using the Wishart random matrices as in (9.25).
\- Calculate WLMMSE-IRC receiver filter as in (9.15).
\- Calculate receiver output SINR as in (9.19) or (9.20) depending on the
scheduled modulation.
### 9.1.3 Modelling methodologies for ML/R-ML
To model BLER performance of ML/R-ML receivers for a PDSCH over any allocation
under an instantaneous channel, the general approach is to derive the mutual
information per transmitted bit (MIB) on each RE of the PDSCH, and then
average the MIB over all REs before mapping avg(MIB) to a BLER. The received
bit mutual information of R-ML/ML receiver at a RE is based on a weighting
between the MIBs at a lower-bound and an upper-bound SNR which is described
below:
, (9.26)
where the function maps one SNR value to the corresponding MIB and one such
function can be pre-derived numerically for QPSK/16QAM/64QAM or approximated
with an mathematical expression (for an example, refer to [Srinivasan, R.,
Zhuang, J., Jalloul, L., Novak, R., & Park, J., "IEEE 802.16 m evaluation
methodology document (EMD)," IEEE 802.16 Broadband Wireless Access Working
Group.]). The procedure to obtain by curve fitting to the actual receiver BLER
performance, as well as the definition of SNR~L~ and SNR~U~, will be given
later. After averaging MIB~ML~ over multiple REs in the PDSCH, an effective
SNR is then obtained as
. (9.27)
Finally the BLER of the interested PDSCH is approximated by the BLER of a SISO
AWGN channel at SNR = SNR~eff~.
Before presenting detail modelling procedures, we first define the signal
model. Let us denote the $V_{i}$-dimensional complex signal vector transmitted
from BS $i$ at the $k$-th subcarrier as $x_{k}^{1} = \left\lbrack
x_{k}^{i,1},x_{k}^{i,2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},x_{k}^{i,V_{i}}
\right\rbrack$, $i = 1,2$, where $V_{i}$ indicates the total number of layers
transmitted from BS $i$ and $x_{k}^{i,v}$ denotes the $v$-th spatial layer at
subcarrier $k$and. Symbol $x_{k}^{i,v}$ is chosen from $M_{c}^{i,v}$-ary
constellation set$S_{i,v}$, where $M_{c}^{i,v}$ represents the modulation
level of $x_{k}^{i,v}$. Without loss of generality, we assume that BS $i = 1$
is the serving BS and BS $i = 2$ is the interfering BS. The received signal
received by the desired UE at the subcarrier _k_ , denoted by $r_{k}$ can be
formulated as
$r_{k} = H_{k}^{1}x_{k}^{1} + H_{k}^{2}x_{k}^{2} + n_{k},\ \text{for}\ k =
1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},K$, (9.28)
where $H_{k}^{i}$denotes an effective channel matrix from BS $i$ to the
desired UE, comprising distance dependent path loss, the actual channel matrix
and precoding matrix, $n_{k}$denotes the additive noise vector whose elements
are independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian with
variance $\sigma_{n}^{2}$, and $K$ represents the total number of coded
subcarriers. Based on the formulation above, here are two alternatives to
obtain the weighting, SNR~L~ and SNR~U~ to compute the MIB in (9.26) for
ML/R-ML receivers.
**[Alternative 1:]{.underline}**
> The post-MLD SINR can be lower-bounded by post-MMSE receiver SINR:
(9.29)
> where $\sigma_{k,v}^{2}$ denotes the mean-squared error (MSE), for the _v_
> -th layer, given by
$\sigma_{k,v}^{2} = \left\lbrack \left( I_{N_{t}} +
\frac{1}{\sigma_{n}^{2}}\overline{H_{k}^{H}}{\overline{}H}_{k} \right)^{- 1}
\right\rbrack_{v,v}$, (9.30)
where${\overline{H}}_{k} = \left\lbrack H_{k}^{1},H_{k}^{2} \right\rbrack$,
$I_{r}$ denotes an identity matrix of size $r$, and $\left\lbrack
\right\rbrack_{v,v}$ represents the $n$-th diagonal element of a matrix.
The post-MLD SINR can be upper-bounded by the genie-aided IF receiver and the
corresponding SINR of the layer $v$ can be represented as
, (9.31)
Where $h_{k,v}^{i}$ indicates the $v$-th column of$H_{k}^{i}$.
**[Alternative 2:]{.underline}**
Suppose the signal model is further simplified by denoting and the spatial
channels corresponding to the two layers to be R-ML/ML processed. By omitting
the index _k_ , the received signal could be represented as:
(9.32)
whereincludes the contribution from interfering layers, other cells, and AWGN.
After whitening, we have
(9.33)
The two data streams can come from a single user or one desired layer (say _x_
~1~) and one interference layer (say _x_ ~2~). In the case of more than 2
total layers (say N), the NxN MIMO channel matrix can be reduced to 2x2 with
the linear processing procedures described above. Then ML/R-ML can be applied
on the "filtered" 2x2 channel matrix, **H**.
Further performing QR decomposition on the channel matrix **H** , we have
, (9.34)
(9.35)
where **Q~1~** and **Q~2\ ~** are scaled unitary matrices. The SNR upper bound
is the total desired signal power (i.e., after perfect cancellation of
interference) and the lower bound is defined as which represents the power of
the signal space orthogonal to the interference, i.e.,
; (9.36)
. (9.37)
Note that in case the complexity-reduced receiver is found sometimes performs
worse than what is predicted by the lower bound, an offset of the lower-bound
by a constant offset value, e.g., 0.5 dB can be applied.
For both alternatives, the impact of channel estimation error to BLER is
modelled separately based on channel estimation error model which is not
described here. With channel estimation error included, the upper and lower
SNR can be adjusted to include the channel estimation error as part of the
noise plus non-dominant interference ratio.
The procedures to build up look-up tables to obtain for the weighting
coefficientare described as follows:
[For alternative 1:]{.underline}
$\beta\left( \text{ISR}_{k,v} \right) = \text{max}\left{ \text{min}\left{
\left( y_{1} - y_{o} \right)\text{ISR}_{k,v} + y_{o}\ ,\ 1 \right}\ ,\
\beta_{\text{min}} \right}$, (9.38)
> where $\text{ISR}_{k,v}$ denotes the interference-to-signal ratio (ISR)
> defined as:
$\text{ISR}_{k,v} = 1 - \text{exp}\left( - \frac{\left\|
H_{k,v}^{2,\text{eff}} \right\|_{F}}{\left\| h_{k,v}^{1} \right\|} \right)$
with$H_{k,v}^{2,\text{eff}} = \left\lbrack \left{ h_{k,l}^{1} \right}_{l \neq
v}H_{k}^{2} \right\rbrack$. (9.39)
Link abstraction model parameters$y_{o}$, $y_{1}$, and $\beta_{\text{min}}$
are for optimization. Detail training procedures to obtain these optimal
parameters are available in [Heunchul Lee, Taeyoon Kim, Wonwoo Park, and
Jonghan Lim, \"Link Performance Abstraction for Interference-Aware
Communications (IAC)\", arXiv e-print (arXiv:1310.0872), October 2013]. The
tuning procedure can cause the resultant tuned$\beta\left( \text{ISR}_{k,v}
\right)$ to be smaller than zero due to the non-ideal implementations of
detection and decoding, especially at low ISRs.
In summary, the proposed link abstraction method needs only the table of three
parameters$y_{1}$, $y_{o}$ and $\beta_{\text{min}}$ for each set of $\left{
\text{MCS}_{1,v},\left{ M_{c}^{1,w} \right}_{w \neq v},\left{ M_{c}^{2,w}
\right}_{w = 1}^{V_{2}} \right}$ along with the MIB mapping functions of
interested modulation levels and AWGN reference curves of interested MCSs,
respectively denoted by $I_{M_{c}}^{}\left( \gamma \right)$ and
$\text{LUT}_{\text{awgn}}^{\text{snr}}\left( \text{SNR},\text{MCS} \right)$ .
[For alternative 2:]{.underline}
Given a MIMO channel realization (frequency-flat), link-level simulations are
run first to get (SNR^(_i_)^, BLER^(_i_)^) pairs over a range of SNR and BLER
at different MCS levels. With these actual data points, an optimal is searched
numerically so that that is minimized over a range of BLER of interest
(typically the BLER "water-fall" region). This method is heuristic but general
enough to accommodate any actual implementation and performance sensitivities
to coding type, MCS, and degradation incurred by reduced-complexity
approximation of ideal ML receivers.
The following parameters are used to characterize:
1) The modulation order and coding rate of the first layer (e.g., MCS1 has 29
levels)
2) The modulation order of the second layer (i.e., MOD2=QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM)
3) The three parameters that adequately characterize the channel: inter-layer
cross-talk _l~21~_ , interference total power _l~22~ ,_ and remaining desired
signal power after the interference-nulling projection _l~11~_. As an example,
the normalized pair (_a_ =\|_l_ ~22~\|/\|_l_ ~21~\|, _b_ =\|_l_ ~11~\|/\|_l_
~21~\|) can be used.
A set of pre-generatedcan be used in system level simulation. The remaining
issue is to build a look-up table (LUT) of so that channels with similar
"characteristics" maps to the similar. Any 2x2 channels will map to an (_a,
b_) pair as described above. As an example,can be pre-generated for the range
of dB and dB to cover almost all realistic 2-by-2 channels. Thecorresponding
to the closest pre-generated (_a, b_) pair values will be used in system
simulation. The more (_a, b_) pairs are computed and stored in the look-up
table, the more preciseis obtained. However, a coarse resolution forstill
gives decent BLER prediction accuracy. One example to obtain a LUT is to first
obtain the optimal for 100 well-spaced typical (_a, b_) and then populate the
entire LUT with a desired granularity after interpolation from those typical-
values. Note that a LUT forcan be generated for each (MCS1, MOD2) pair.
### 9.1.4 Modelling methodologies for CWIC
Turbo-CWIC receivers are non-linear receivers that decode and subtract the
interference. Contrarily to hard CWIC based on CRC check, turbo-CWIC receivers
are based on soft interference cancellation (e.g Turbo SIC). Their performance
improves with the reliability of the interference reconstruction as the number
of iterations increases. Modelling this interference reconstruction
reliability has a significant impact on the accuracy of the performance
prediction. Therefore, we propose a new L2S that captures the soft
interference reconstruction and subtraction reliability.
Suppose the received signal is given by the superposition of N spatial layers.
Without loss of generality, we focus on the single interferer case. Let _x1_
be the desired layer and _x2_ the interference layer. The signal at the input
of the detector (after soft interference subtraction) at iteration _j_ can be
written as:
(9.40)
where is the channel matrix of the _i^th^_ layer on the _k^th^_ resource
element (RE), is the total number of REs considered, **_n~k~_** are i.i.d.
circularly symmetric Gaussian vector samples of covariance , is the channel
estimate of the interference layer and is the soft symbol estimate conditional
on the decoding of the interferer at iteration _j-1_. The fiability of the
soft symbol estimate at iteration _j_ is captured by a scalar quantity
_v~j-1~_ that drives the performance of the interference cancellation at
iteration _j_. When the decoding of the interferer message is reliable, the
interferer symbols reconstruction is expected to be accurate and _v~j~_ will
tend to 0. When the decoding of the interferer is not reliable, _v~j~_ will
tend to where is the power of .
The proposed L2S extends the classical Mutual Information Effective SNR
Mapping (MIESM) by calling iteratively bivariante Look-Up Tables (LUTs) that
are simulated offline on AWGN channels. The LUTs take as input the effective
SINR and the mutual information on the systematic bits provided by the second
recursive systematic convolutional code last decoding at iteration _j-1_ (the
turbo-code is composed of two recursive systematic convolutional codes that
are iteratively serially decoded). These LUTs give as output _v~j\ ~_ , and
the BLER if needed as summarized in Figure 5 below. More details are given in
[7].
{width="6.21875in" height="2.8645833333333335in"}
Figure5: L2S for turbo-CWIC receivers at iteration _j_ , initialization and
Note that the proposed System Level Modeling Methodology needs to be
calibrated (see [7] for the explanations). The calibration does not depend on
the channel outcome but depends on the Modulation and Coding Ccheme (MCS). We
proposed a simple, yet effective, calibration procedure whose principle is to
adjust the output of LUTv with a real-valued factor. More specifically, v~j~
is replaced by , which has the effect to artificially reduce the SINRs that
are used in the performance prediction method. We searched the optimal
minimizing the average relative error between the simulated BLER and the
calibrated predicted BLER over a large number of channel outcomes at each
iteration for the BLER range of interest.
### 9.1.5 Modelling Methodologies for SLIC

Without loss of generality, assume that cell {width="7.152777777777777e-2in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"} is the serving cell and the UE attempts to
cancel the data transmission of cell {width="0.10486111111111111in"

* * *
After the SLIC modelling, the equivalent received signal as in (9.44) is
further processed by the standard MMSE receiver to produce the decoding
statistics.
For SINR calculation of MMSE receiver the residual interference is assumed as
Gaussian noise (reuse existing link curves)
[- Alt1]{.underline}: In system level, calculate SINR of each RE/RB, and
calculate effective SINR of corresponding codeblock/transport block.
[- Alt2]{.underline}: For each codeblock, average residual interference level
over all relevant REs. Use the average as common noise level of each RE in
effective SINR calculation.
Next, we describe how a lookup table for {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"} is computed using link level simulations.
Let {width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.1673611111111111in"} be a scalar
quantity that denotes the quality of cancelation. It is defined as
* * *
     ![](media/image98.png){width="3.0208333333333335in" height="0.4375in"}   (9.46)
* * *
where the summation is over all tones k in an RB. We call
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.1673611111111111in"} the
interference suppression factor. As an example, a value of
{width="0.5819444444444445in" height="0.1673611111111111in"} dB for a given RB
denotes that the interference from cell 2 is suppressed by 10dB on average on
that RB.
In general, the interference suppression factor is a random variable. The
distribution of {width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.1673611111111111in"}
will have a different mean and variance when all detectors are correct than
when one or more detectors are in error. Thus alpha will have a multimodal
distribution. When the blind detectors are correct, we expect interference
cancelation to be accurate, i.e. {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"} should be a small quantity, and when the
detectors are incorrect, the interference cancelation will be inaccurate, i.e.
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.1673611111111111in"} should be a
large quantity and may also exceed 1.
For simplicity, we consider {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"} to have a bi-modal distribution. We will say
that {width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.1673611111111111in"} is in Mode
0 when the spatial scheme and precoding matrix has been detected accurately
and in mode 1 otherwise. In general, a more elaborate multi-mode modelling can
be used. Our simulation results show that a bi-modal model is sufficient.
In a single interferer link level simulation, we log the value of the
interference suppression factor, computed per RB, and across multiple fading
channel realizations as a function of the following five parameters.
\- Interferer signal to noise ratio {width="0.5729166666666666in"
height="0.1763888888888889in"}, which may depend on the instantaneous channel
realization of one or more cells
\- Interferer modulation order
\- Interferer rank
\- Interferer transmission mode/ spatial scheme
\- Serving signal to noise ratio {width="0.4798611111111111in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"}, which may depend on the instantaneous channel
realizations of one or more cells
For each choice of the above five parameters, we compute
\- the quantity {width="0.14652777777777778in" height="0.24861111111111112in"}
, defined as the mean value of {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.24861111111111112in"} (in the linear domain) given that
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.24861111111111112in"} is in Mode 0,
by averaging the {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.24861111111111112in"} values across multiple RBs and subframes (note
that we log one value of {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.24861111111111112in"} per RB), and
\- the probability {width="0.13472222222222222in"
height="0.24861111111111112in"} that {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.24861111111111112in"} is in Mode 0, by counting across multiple RBs
and subframes. As a special case, if network assistance reveals to the UE the
spatial scheme and the precoding matrix used by the interferer on RBs on which
cancelation is attempted, then{width="0.42569444444444443in"
height="0.24861111111111112in"}.
The quantity {width="0.14652777777777778in" height="0.1673611111111111in"},
defined as the mean value of {width="8.333333333333333e-2in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"} (in the linear domain) given that
{width="8.333333333333333e-2in" height="0.1673611111111111in"} is in Mode 1,
is fixed to be 1. In other words, when the detection of the spatial scheme and
precoding matrix fails, our model assumes that no cancelation is performed.
Using single interferer link level simulations we build a five dimensional
lookup table ({width="0.5729166666666666in" height="0.1763888888888889in"} and
{width="0.4798611111111111in" height="0.1673611111111111in"} are quantized in
3dB increments) for the pair of quantities{width="0.4465277777777778in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"}. Although the description in this subclause was
for the single interferer case, this method could be extended to multiple
interferer scenarios by using a higher dimensional lookup table to incorporate
parameters of the additional interferer(s).
#### 9.1.5.2 Alternative 2
Generally, the system level modelling methodology for SLIC is carried out by
two steps. The first step is to derive the post-processing SINR per
subcarrier. After that, the simulator predicts the instantaneous BLER for each
transmission block by a link quality model (such as MIESM,EESM etc.) based on
the input SINRs.
Here, we will only focuses on how to obtaining of post-processing SINRs. For
simplicity, we **assume the target UE eliminates the strongest interference,
and only one layer is transmitted for both target UE and interfering UE.**
**The received downlink signal for each subcarrier** can be written as
* * *
     (9.47)
* * *
Where _H~1~_ denotes the effective channel from the strongest interfering cell
to the target UE and $x_{1}$denotes the strongest interfering symbol.
In the first place, the strongest interference signal is detected with its
corresponding post-processed SINR, take MMSE receiver as an example,
* * *
     (9.48)
* * *
where
* * *
     (9.49)
* * *
Once the strongest interference signal is detected, it could be removed from
the received signal. However, the strongest interference signal cannot be
completely removed in practical system. Let{width="0.1763888888888889in"
height="0.1673611111111111in"} denotes the residual error and
$\overline{\sigma}$ be the variance of demodulated symbols residual error,
$e = {\overset{\sim}{H}}_{1}x_{1} -
{\overset{\sim}{H}}_{1}{\overset{\sim}{x}}_{1} = {\overset{\sim}{H}}_{1}\left(
x_{1} - {\overset{\sim}{x}}_{1} \right)$, $\overline{\sigma} =
\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l = 1}^{L}\left\| x_{1,l} - {\overset{\sim}{x}}_{1,l}
\right\|^{2}$, (9.50)
where L is the number of trials.
Considering the remaining interference after SLIC, the post-processed SINR of
the desired signal could be expressed as
* * *
     (9.51)
* * *
where
* * *
     (9.52)
* * *
$\overline{\sigma}$can be obtained by looking up a predefined SNR-to-variance
mapping table. Here e a simple link level simulation is proposed to estimate .
The link simulation process is illustrated in Figure 6.
Figure6: Link simulation structure for variance calculation
Assuming the transmitted complex symbol is _x_ , _x_ belongs to a certain
modulation constellation _A~j~_ , _j_ =_1,...,M, M_ is the modulation order.
The received signal in an AWGN channel is given by
* * *
,. (9.53)
* * *
**[When the receiver performs hard decision,]{.underline}**
The estimated constellation _A~j~_ can be obtained by selecting the candidate
symbol with minimum Euclidian distance. Take N trials for one SNR, then the
variance can be calculated as
* * *
     (9.54)
* * *
**[When the receiver performs soft decision,]{.underline}**
The estimated soft constellation can be calculated by
* * *
     (9.55)
* * *
Also take N trials for one SNR, and the variance can be calculated as
* * *
     (9.56)
* * *
After running simulation for different SNRs and different modulation orders,
we obtain SNR-to-variance mapping table which is applied to system level
simulation for each modulation type in advance.
#### 9.1.5.3 Alternative 3
In this alternative, the link-to-system model includes the channel and noise
estimation of the link-level and estimated and true SINR values after each
cancellation and demodulation iteration are derived from an equation based on
LMMSE-IRC SINR calculations which takes into account the mismatch when LMMSE
weights are constructed from channel estimates. BLock Error Probabilities (one
per codeword) are produced per subframe given the following inputs:
\- The instantaneous channels to the UE from each (dominant) cell's TX ports
\- The modulation order and precoder (CRS-based TM) for each (dominant) cell
transmission
\- The noise covariance (including non-dominant cells)
Figure 7 shows a block diagram of the link-to-system model, which includes the
following steps:
1) Channel and noise estimation are performed as in the link-level where the
estimation is taking into account instantaneous channel realizations to the UE
from each (dominant) cell's TX ports. The estimates are per subcarrier $k$and
cell$c$, ${\hat{H}}_{k,c}$,${\hat{Q}}_{0,k,c}$. In the case of DMRS-based
channel estimation, the corresponding estimated effective
channels,${\hat{G}}_{k,c}$, follows directly.
2) Transmission parameters required for demodulation of dominant interfering
signals are blindly detected, unless they are assumed to be known via network
assisted signalling.
3) Noise covariance matrices are determined and are based on the true and
estimated effective channels ($G_{k,c},{\hat{G}}_{k,c}$) and the true and
estimated background noise ($Q_{0,k,c},{\hat{Q}}_{0,k,c}$). For SLIC
receivers, this step is iterative and loops over a set of cells ($C$),
including the serving cell. With SLIC cancellation efficiency factors here
denoted by$\text{CE}_{k,c}$and $\text{CE}_{\text{hat},k,c}$, the noise
covariance matrices, including previous cancellation steps in the loop, are
obtained as
$Q_{k,c} = Q_{0,k,c} + \sum_{(c' \in C) \neq c}^{}{(1
-}\text{CE}_{k,c'})G_{k,c'}G_{k,c'}^{H}$ (9.57)
${\hat{Q}}_{k,c} = {\hat{Q}}_{0,k,c} + \sum_{(c' \in C) \neq c}^{}{(1
-}\text{CE}_{\text{hat},k,c'}){\hat{G}}_{k,c'}{\hat{G}}_{k,c'}^{H}$ (9.58)
4) The estimated and true SINRs after the combining,
${\hat{\sigma}}_{\text{signal},k,c}^{2}$/${\hat{\sigma}}_{\text{noise},k,c}^{2}$and
$\sigma_{\text{signal},k,c}^{2}$/ $\sigma_{\text{noise},k,c}^{2}$(genie), are
derived from an equation based on LMMSE-IRC SINR calculations which takes into
account the mismatch when LMMSE weights are constructed from channel
estimates, i.e. ${\hat{G}}_{k,c} = G_{k,c} + {\overset{\sim}{G}}_{k,c}$.
5) The cancellation efficiency factors $\text{CE}_{k,c}$and
$\text{CE}_{\text{hat},k,c}$are pre-computed and stored in Look-Up-Tables
(LUT) with
${\hat{\sigma}}_{\text{signal},k,c}^{2}$,${\hat{\sigma}}_{\text{noise},k,c}^{2}$,$\sigma_{\text{signal},k,c}^{2}$,$\sigma_{\text{noise},k,c}^{2}$
and modulation order (true and detected) as inputs.
6) When ending the SLIC cancellation loop, estimated and true SINRs of the
serving cell are used to determine effective SINRs which are translated to
BLEP values using LUTs for the LTE turbo decoding scheme.
Note: The link abstraction model for E-LMMSE-IRC is obtained with
$\text{CE}_{k,c} = 0$and $\text{CE}_{\text{hat},k,c} = 0$.

needed for SLIC)
### 9.1.6 Modelling methodologies for iterative ML
For non-linear ML receivers, per-layer SINR may not be a good metric because
the ML receiver exploits the discrete nature of inter-layer interference.
Moreover, the ML receiver in NAICS needs to handle more layers (considering
the total number of serving and interference layers) than the conventional ML
receiver does. In addition, the iterative ML receiver in NAICS exploits the
coded nature of interference as well. To implement NAICS iterative ML
receivers, the principle of iterative detection and decoding (IDD) can be
applied to both the serving signals and the interference signals in either
successive or parallel manner. In this subclause, we introduce a new metric
that captures the gain of iterative ML receivers that perform interference
detection and decoding additionally.
For NAICS, we consider the following system model
* * *
     (9.59)
* * *
where is a received signal vector, _and are the serving and interference
channel matrices, respectively,_ and are _the transmitted symbol vectors_ with
unit powers _for the serving and the interfering cells, respectively_ , and is
a zero-mean circularly symmetric white Gaussian noise vector such that . The
parameters and represent the number of receive antennas, the number of serving
layers, the number of interference layers, and the number of coded
subcarriers. Without loss of generality, we omit the subcarrier index.
As can be seen Equation (9.59), we can consider NAICS communication as
multiple access channel and the corresponding rate region is illustrated in
Figure 4, where and denote the achievable rate for and _, respectively._
{width="5.426388888888889in" height="3.2819444444444446in"}
Figure 8. The rate regions for $x_{s}$ and $x_{i}$
From this figure, it can be seen that the rates for and should be selected
jointly. For the same reason, the link-quality metric based on the mutual
information cannot be simply decoupled into two link-quality metrics for
serving signals and interfering signals. However, for any given , can be
considered as a link-quality metric for serving signals and can be considered
as a link-quality metric for interfering signals because they determine the
rates for serving signals and interfering signals, respectively. While any can
be chosen, we use for our simulations.
In Figure 8, the multiple access channel rate region is given by
* * *
_._ (9.60)
* * *
and the rates corresponding to two points are obtained by
* * *
, (9.61) , (9.62) , (9.63) , (9.64)
* * *
where and .
Then, a link-quality metric for serving signals over multiple subcarriers is
given by
* * *
     (9.65)
* * *
and a link-quality metric for interfering signals over multiple subcarriers is
given by
* * *
     (9.66)
* * *
Finally, we propose to build BLER look-up tables (LUT) based on link-level
simulations given by
* * *
     (9.67)
* * *
where MCS~s~ and MCS~i~ denote serving MCS and interference MCS, respectively.
This LUT needs to be built for all possible rank combinations for serving and
interference signals. However, it does not need to be built for all precoding
matrices because the effective channel matrices _and_ that include precoding
can be used. The system level simulations for iterative R-ML receiver use the
BLER table constructed with . This BLER table construction naturally captures
any suboptimality in detection and decoding of iterative R-ML receiver.
## 9.2 Preliminary system-level performance results
Company results so far can be found in R1-141003 [16]. Note that all results
so far have not considered any assistance signalling overhead or backhaul
latency more than 2 msec in inter-cell NAICS in scenarios 1 and 2a.
# 10 Potential specification impact
Some transmission parameters are listed in the "receiver assumption" subclause
of TR36.866, and they include:
\- Parameters that are higher-layer configured per the current specifications
(e.g., TM, cell ID, MBSFN subframes, CRS antenna ports, P~A~, P~B~)
\- Parameters that are dynamically signalled per the current specifications
(e.g., CFI, PMI, RI, MCS, resource allocation, DMRS ports, used in TM10)
\- Other deployment related parameters (e.g., synchronization, CP,
subframe/slot alignment)
Compared to requiring NAICS receivers to detect all interference parameters,
some network signalling/coordination can be beneficial for reducing receiver
complexity and/or improve performance with increased robustness under intra-
cell and inter-cell interference scenario.
\- The transmission parameters that can be considered for signalling and that
for receiver detection are FFS
\- Note that assistance signalling can be different from transmission
parameters
\- Some transmission parameters may be detected or corresponding signalling of
those parameters may be introduced
\- Such assistance signalling may use higher layers regardless of whether the
associated transmission parameter is higher-layer configured or dynamic
\- Some dynamic assistance signalling can be considered if sufficient system-
level gain is shown, and some dynamic parameters may be coordinated, but with
scheduling constraint, or detected or signalled or a combination of the three
\- Other deployment related parameters may be coordinated or detected.
\- Semi-static coordination signalling or coordination is suited for non-ideal
backhaul
\- Dynamic coordination may be feasible only under ideal backhaul
\- Other potential PHY impact needs further study (e.g., CSI feedback)
# 11 Conclusions
The following conclusions were made:
  * Higher-layer signaling of parameters related to interference PDSCH could be beneficial to reduce the blind detection complexity or performance degradation
\- It is not precluded at yet that some of the following candidate parameters
may be blindly detected
\- Candidate parameters for higher-layer signaling for further study both in
RAN1 and RAN4 include
\- Resource allocation granularity (e.g., a group of PRB or PRB pairs)
\- RA type (e.g., type 0, LVRB, N~gap~ used for DVRB)
\- System bandwidth
\- Synchronization indication (e.g., CP length)
\- CSI-RS configuration
\- QCL
\- Cell-ID
\- CRS ports
\- MBSFN pattern
\- ρ~B~/ρ~A~
\- For the following parameters of interference PDSCH, UE blind detection is
desirable to reduce scheduling restriction and signaling overhead, possibly
detected from a reduced subset (e.g., RRC signaled) of all values for some
parameters
\- Presence or absence of interference
\- TM
\- For DMRS-based TMs: DMRS ports, modulation order, Virtual cell ID, nSCID,
Cell ID, CRS ports, and MBSFN pattern
\- For CRS-based TMs: PMI, RI, modulation order, Cell ID, CRS ports, and MBSFN
pattern, ρ~A~
\- CFI (if not coordinated and required by receiver implementation)
\- Dynamic signaling from an interference or a serving cell can be evaluated
after conclusions on blind detection, conditions and assumptions including the
physical channel and assumed content can be further discussed
\- Further investigation of CSI enhancement is needed in order to help to
ensure that NAICS receivers can achieve a user throughput gain
In RAN4#70, the following conclusions on blind detection of interference
parameters were made:
\- Blind detection for some parameters was found acceptable in terms of
complexity and performance in some cases (e.g., under some interference
conditions), but not in some other cases and further study is needed.
\- For all transmission modes, at least the modulation order can be blindly
detected assuming all other parameters are known.
\- For CRS-based transmission modes, at least PMI rank-1 (2 CRS ports) can be
blindly detected assuming all other parameters are known.
\- For all transmission modes, the presence of interference PDSCH can be
blindly detected assuming all other parameters are known.
\- For DMRS-based TM, at least DMRS ports (with restriction to port 7/8) and
modulation order can be blindly detected assuming all other parameters are
known.
\- Working assumption: For CRS-based transmission modes, at least RI can be
blindly detected assuming all other parameters are known.
