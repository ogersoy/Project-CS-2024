## 4.1 Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the terminating eNB exactly and completely. Any rule that
specifies the behaviour of the originating eNB shall be possible to be
verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in clause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
1) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports
procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the initiating
message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message
used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an
appropriate cause value.
2) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if supported,\"
perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node
shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting
node about the not supported functionality.
\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not
explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response
message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see section 10.
## 4.2 Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related
IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format
that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded
regardless of the standard version.
## 4.3 Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the
Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case
characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g. Handover Preparation
procedure.
Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is
written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word
\"message\", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the
_Information Element Name_ is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the
abbreviation \"IE\", e.g. _E-RAB ID_ IE.
Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in
the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in sub clause
9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. \"Value\".
# 5 X2AP services
The present clause describes the services an eNB offers to its neighbours.
## 5.1 X2AP procedure modules
The X2 interface X2AP procedures are divided into two modules as follows:
1\. X2AP Basic Mobility Procedures;
2\. X2AP Global Procedures;
The X2AP Basic Mobility Procedures module contains procedures used to handle
the UE mobility within E-UTRAN.
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to a
specific UE. The procedures in this module are in contrast to the above module
involving two peer eNBs.
## 5.2 Parallel transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in
time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing X2AP procedure
related to a certain UE.
# 6 Services expected from signalling transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of X2AP messages.
X2AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
X2 signalling transport is described in TS 36.422 [21].
# 7 Functions of X2AP
The X2AP protocol provides the following functions:
\- Mobility Management. This function allows the eNB to move the
responsibility of a certain UE to another eNB or request another eNB to
provide radio resources for a certain UE while keeping responsibility for that
UE. Forwarding of user plane data, Status Transfer and UE Context Release
function are parts of the mobility management.
\- Load Management. This function is used by eNBs to indicate resource status,
overload and traffic load to each other.
\- Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting of
general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not
been defined.
\- Resetting the X2. This function is used to reset the X2 interface.
\- Setting up the X2. This function is used to exchange necessary data for the
eNB for setup the X2 interface and implicitly perform an X2 Reset.
\- eNB Configuration Update. This function allows updating of application
level data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over the X2
interface.
\- Mobility Parameters Management. **This function allows the eNB to
coordinate adaptation of mobility parameter settings with a peer eNB.**
\- Mobility Robustness Optimisation. This function allows reporting of
information related to mobility failure events.
\- Energy Saving. This function allows decreasing energy consumption by
enabling indication of cell activation/deactivation over the X2 interface.
\- X2 Release. This function allows an eNB to be aware that the signalling
connection to a peer eNB is unavailable.
\- Message transfer. This function allows indirect transport of X2AP messages
to a peer eNB.
\- Registration. This function allows registration of eNB in case indirect
transport of X2AP messages is supported.
\- Removing the X2. This function allows removing the signaling connection
between two eNBs in a controlled manner.
The mapping between the above functions and X2 EPs is shown in the table
below.

## 8.2 Basic mobility procedures
### 8.2.1 Handover Preparation
#### 8.2.1.1 General
This procedure is used to establish necessary resources in an eNB for an
incoming handover.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.1.2-1: Handover Preparation, successful operation
The source eNB initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST message
to the target eNB. When the source eNB sends the HANDOVER REQUEST message, it
shall start the timer T~RELOCprep.~
The allocation of resources according to the values of the _Allocation and
Retention Priority_ IE included in the _E-RAB Level QoS Parameters_ IE shall
follow the principles described for the E-RAB Setup procedure in TS 36.413
[4].
The source eNB may include in the _GUMMEI_ IE any GUMMEI corresponding to the
source MME node.
If at least one of the requested non-GBR E-RABs is admitted to the cell
indicated by the _Target Cell ID_ IE, the target eNB shall reserve necessary
resources, and send the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message back to the
source eNB. The target eNB shall include the E-RABs for which resources have
been prepared at the target cell in the _E-RABs Admitted List_ IE. The target
eNB shall include the E-RABs that have not been admitted in the _E-RABs Not
Admitted List_ IE with an appropriate cause value.
At reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target eNB shall:
\- prepare the configuration of the AS security relation between the UE and
the target eNB by using the information in the _UE Security Capabilities_ IE
and the _AS Security Information_ IE in the _UE Context Information_ IE**.**
For each E-RAB for which the source eNB proposes to do forwarding of downlink
data, the source eNB shall include the _DL Forwarding_ IE within the _E-RABs
To be Setup Item_ IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST message. For each E-RAB that it
has decided to admit, the target eNB may include the _DL GTP Tunnel Endpoint_
IE within the _E-RABs Admitted Item_ IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message to indicate that it accepts the proposed forwarding of downlink data
for this bearer. This GTP tunnel endpoint may be different from the
corresponding _GTP TEID_ IE in the _E-RAB To Be Switched in Downlink List_ IE
of the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message (see TS 36.413 [4]) depending on
implementation choice.
For each bearer in the _E-RABs Admitted List_ IE, the target eNB may include
the _UL GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ IE to indicate that it requests data forwarding
of uplink packets to be performed for that bearer.
Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the source eNB
shall stop the timer T~RELOCprep~, start the timer TX2~RELOCoverall~ and
terminate the Handover Preparation procedure. The source eNB is then defined
to have a Prepared Handover for that X2 UE-associated signalling.
If the _Trace Activation_ IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message then
the target eNB shall, if supported, initiate the requested trace function as
described in TS 32.422 [6]. In particular, the target eNB shall, if supported:
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE does not include the _MDT Configuration_ IE,
initiate the requested trace session as described in TS 32.422 [6];
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MDT Activation_ IE, within the
_MDT Configuration_ IE, set to "Immediate MDT and Trace" initiate the
requested trace session and MDT session as described in TS 32.422 [6];
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MDT Activation_ IE, within the
_MDT Configuration_ IE, set to "Immediate MDT Only" initiate the requested MDT
session as described in TS 32.422 [6] and the target eNB shall ignore
_Interfaces To Trace_ IE, and _Trace Depth_ IE;
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MDT Location Information_ IE,
within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, store this information and take it into
account in the requested MDT session;
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _Signalling based MDT PLMN List_
IE, within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, the eNB may use it to propagate the MDT
Configuration as described in TS 37.320 [31].
If the _Management Based MDT Allowed_ IE only or the _Management Based MDT
Allowed_ IE and the _Management Based MDT PLMN List_ IE is contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store the
received information in the UE context, and use this information to allow
subsequent selection of the UE for management based MDT defined in TS 32.422
[6].
If the _Masked IMEISV_ IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message the
target eNB shall, if supported, use it to determine the characteristics of the
UE for subsequent handling.
The source eNB shall, if supported and available in the UE context, include
the _Management Based MDT Allowed_ IE and the _Management Based MDT PLMN List_
IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, except if the source eNB selects a serving
PLMN in the target eNB which is not included in the Management Based MDT PLMN
List. If the _Management Based MDT PLMN List_ IE is not present, the source
eNB shall, if supported, include the _Management Based MDT Allowed_ IE, if
this information is available in the UE context, in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, except if the source eNB selects a serving PLMN in the target eNB
different from the serving PLMN in the source eNB.
If the _Handover Restriction List_ IE is
\- contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall
\- store the information received in the _Handover Restriction List_ IE in the
UE context;
\- use this information to determine a target for the UE during subsequent
mobility action for which the eNB provides information about the target of the
mobility action towards the UE, except when one of the E-RABs has a particular
ARP value (TS 23.401 [12]) in which case the information shall not apply;
\- use this information to select a proper SCG during dual connectivity
operation.
\- not contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall
consider that no roaming and no access restriction apply to the UE.
If the _Location Reporting Information_ IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message then the target eNB should initiate the requested location reporting
functionality as defined in TS 36.413 [4].
If the _SRVCC Operation Possible_ IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, the target eNB shall store the content of such IE in the UE context
and use it as defined in TS 23.216 [20].
If the _UE Security Capabilities_ IE included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
only contains the EIA0 algorithm as defined in TS 33.401 [18] and if this EIA0
algorithm is defined in the configured list of allowed integrity protection
algorithms in the eNB (TS 33.401 [18]), the eNB shall take it into use and
ignore the keys received in the _AS Security Information_ IE.
The HANDOVER REQUEST message shall contain the _Subscriber Profile ID_ _for
RAT/Frequency priority_ IE, if available.
If the _Subscriber Profile ID_ _for RAT/Frequency priority_ IE is contained in
the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall store this information and
the target eNB should use the information as defined in TS 36.300 [15].
Upon reception of _UE History Information_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message,
the target eNB shall collect the information defined as mandatory in the _UE
History Information_ IE and shall, if supported, collect the information
defined as optional in the _UE History Information_ IE, for as long as the UE
stays in one of its cells, and store the collected information to be used for
future handover preparations.
Upon reception of the _UE History Information from the UE_ IE in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store the collected
information to be used for future handover preparations.
If the _Mobility Information_ IE is provided in the HANDOVER REQUEST message,
the target eNB shall, if supported, store this information and use it as
defined in TS 36.300 [15]. The target eNB shall, if supported, store the
C-RNTI of the source cell received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message.
If the _Expected UE Behaviour_ IE is provided in the HANDOVER REQUEST message,
the target eNB shall, if supported, store this information and may use it to
determine the RRC connection time.
If the _ProSe Authorized_ IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message and
it contains one or more IEs set to \"authorized\", the eNB shall, if
supported, consider that the UE is authorized for the relevant ProSe
service(s).
#### 8.2.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.2.1.3-1: Handover Preparation, unsuccessful operation
If the target eNB does not admit at least one non-GBR E-RAB, or a failure
occurs during the Handover Preparation, the target eNB shall send the HANDOVER
PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source eNB. The message shall contain the
_Cause_ IE with an appropriate value.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing _RRC Context_
IE that does not include required information as specified in TS 36.331 [9],
the target eNB shall send the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message to the
source eNB.
**Interactions with Handover Cancel procedure:**
If there is no response from the target eNB to the HANDOVER REQUEST message
before timer T~RELOCprep~ expires in the source eNB, the source eNB should
cancel the Handover Preparation procedure towards the target eNB by initiating
the Handover Cancel procedure with the appropriate value for the _Cause_ IE.
The source eNB shall ignore any HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE or HANDOVER
PREPARATION FAILURE message received after the initiation of the Handover
Cancel procedure and remove any reference and release any resources related to
the concerned X2 UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing multiple _E-
RAB ID_ IEs (in the _E-RABs To Be Setup List_ IE) set to the same value, the
target eNB shall not admit the corresponding E-RABs.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing a _E-RAB
Level QoS Parameters_ IE which contains a _QCI_ IE indicating a GBR bearer (as
defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the _GBR QoS
Information_ IE, the target eNB shall not admit the corresponding E-RAB.
If the supported algorithms for encryption defined in the _Encryption
Algorithms_ IE in the _UE Security Capabilities_ IE in the _UE Context
Information_ IE, plus the mandated support of EEA0 in all UEs (TS 33.401
[18]), do not match any algorithms defined in the configured list of allowed
encryption algorithms in the target eNB (TS 33.401 [18]), the target eNB shall
reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the supported algorithms for integrity defined in the _Integrity Protection
Algorithms_ IE in the _UE Security Capabilities_ IE in the _UE Context
Information_ IE, plus the mandated support of the EIA0 algorithm in all UEs
(TS 33.401 [18]), do not match any algorithms defined in the configured list
of allowed integrity protection algorithms in the eNB (TS 33.401 [18]), the
eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message which does not contain
the _Handover Restriction List_ IE, and the PLMN to be used cannot be
determined otherwise, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the
HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing the _Handover
Restriction List_ IE, and the serving PLMN is not supported by the target
cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION
FAILURE message.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message which does not contain
the _CSG Membership Status_ IE, and the target cell is a hybrid cell, the
target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE
message.
If the target cell is a CSG cell and the target eNB has not received any CSG
ID of the source cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the
HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the target cell is a CSG cell with a different CSG from the source cell,
the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION
FAILURE message.
### 8.2.2 SN Status Transfer
#### 8.2.2.1 General
The purpose of the SN Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the uplink PDCP
SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status
either, from the source to the target eNB during an X2 handover, or between
the eNBs involved in dual connectivity, for each respective E-RAB for which
PDCP SN and HFN status preservation applies.
If the SN Status Transfer procedure is applied in the course of dual
connectivity, in the subsequent specification text
\- the behaviour of the eNB from which the E-RAB context is transferred, i.e.,
the eNB involved in dual connectivity from which data forwarding, is specified
by the behaviour of the \"source eNB\",
\- the behaviour of the eNB to which the E-RAB context is transferred, i.e.,
the eNB involved in dual connectivity to which data is forwarded, is specified
by the behaviour of the \"target eNB\".
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.2.2-1: SN Status Transfer, successful operation
The source eNB initiates the procedure by stop assigning PDCP SNs to downlink
SDUs and stop delivering UL SDUs towards the EPC and sending the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message to the target eNB at the time point when it considers the
transmitter/receiver status to be frozen. The target eNB using Full
Configuration for this handover as per TS 36.300 [15] shall ignore the
information received in this message.
The _E-RABs Subject To Status Transfer List_ IE included in the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message contains the E-RAB ID(s) corresponding to the E-RAB(s) for
which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation shall be applied.
If the source eNB includes in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, the information
on the missing and received uplink SDUs in the _Receive Status Of UL PDCP
SDUs_ **IE or _Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs Extended_ IE for each E-RAB for
which the source eNB has accepted the request from the target eNB for uplink
forwarding, then the target eNB may use it in a Status Report message sent to
the UE over the radio.**
For each E-RAB for which the _DL COUNT Value_ IE is received in the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall use it to mark with the value contained
in the _PDCP-SN_ IE of this IE the first downlink packet for which there is no
PDCP SN yet assigned. If the _DL COUNT Value Extended_ IE is included in the
_E-RABs Subject To Status Transfer Item_ IE, the target eNB shall, if
supported, use the value contained in the _PDCP-SN Extended_ IE of the _DL
COUNT Value Extended_ IE instead of the value contained in the _PDCP-SN_ IE of
the _DL COUNT Value_ IE.
For each E-RAB for which the _UL COUNT Value_ IE is received in the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall not deliver any uplink packet which has
a PDCP SN lower than the value contained in the _PDCP-SN_ IE of this IE. If
the _UL COUNT Value Extended_ IE is included in the _E-RABs Subject To Status
Transfer Item_ IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use the value contained
in the _PDCP-SN Extended_ IE of the _UL COUNT Value Extended_ IE instead of
the value contained in the _PDCP-SN_ IE of the _UL COUNT Value_ IE.
#### 8.2.2.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the target eNB receives this message for a UE for which no prepared
handover exists at the target eNB, the target eNB shall ignore the message.
### 8.2.3 UE Context Release
#### 8.2.3.1 General
For handover, the UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target eNB
to indicate to the source eNB that radio and control plane resources for the
associated UE context are allowed to be released.
For dual connectivity, UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the MeNB
to finally release the UE context at the SeNB.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.3.2-1: UE Context Release, successful operation for handover
Figure 8.2.3.2-2: UE Context Release, successful operation for dual
connectivity
**Handover**
The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target eNB. By sending
the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the target eNB informs the source eNB of
Handover success and triggers the release of resources.
Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the source eNB may release
radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE context. For
E-RABs for which data forwarding has been performed, the source eNB should
continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets are received at the
source eNB from the EPC or the source eNB buffer has not been emptied (an
implementation dependent mechanism decides that data forwarding can be
stopped). When the eNB supporting L-GW function for SIPTO\@LN operation
releases radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE
context, it shall also request using intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW
to release the SIPTO\@LN PDN connection as defined in TS 23.401 [12].
**Dual Connectivity**
The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the MeNB. By sending the UE
CONTEXT RELEASE message the MeNB informs the SeNB that the UE Context can be
removed.
Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the SeNB may release radio
and control plane related resources associated to the UE context. For E-RABs
for which data forwarding has been performed, the SeNB should continue
forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets are received at the SeNB from
the EPC or the SeNB buffer has not been emptied (an implementation dependent
mechanism decides that data forwarding can be stopped).
#### 8.2.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.2.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the UE Context Release procedure is not initiated towards the source eNB
from any prepared eNB before the expiry of the timer TX2~RELOCoverall~, the
source eNB shall request the MME to release the UE context.
If the UE returns to source eNB before the reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE
message or the expiry of the timer TX2~RELOCoverall~, the source eNB shall
stop the TX2~RELOCoverall~ and continue to serve the UE.
### 8.2.4 Handover Cancel
#### 8.2.4.1 General
The Handover Cancel procedure is used to enable a source eNB to cancel an
ongoing handover preparation or an already prepared handover.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.4.2-1: Handover Cancel, successful operation
The source eNB initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER CANCEL message
to the target eNB. The source eNB shall indicate the reason for cancelling the
handover by means of an appropriate cause value.
At the reception of the HANDOVER CANCEL message, the target eNB shall remove
any reference to, and release any resources previously reserved to the
concerned UE context.
The _New_ _eNB UE X2AP ID_ IE shall be included if it has been obtained from
the target eNB.
#### 8.2.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.2.4.4 Abnormal Conditions
Should the HANDOVER CANCEL message refer to a context that does not exist, the
target eNB shall ignore the message.
## 8.3 Global Procedures
### 8.3.1 Load Indication
#### 8.3.1.1 General
The purpose of the Load Indication procedure is to transfer load and
interference co-ordination information between eNBs controlling intra-
frequency neighboring cells, and additionally between eNBs controlling inter-
frequency neighboring cells for TDD.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.1.2-1: Load Indication, successful operation
An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending LOAD INFORMATION message to a
peer eNB~2~.
If the _UL Interference Overload Indication_ IE is received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, it indicates the interference level experienced by the
indicated cell on all resource blocks, per PRB. If the _Extended UL
Interference Overload Info_ IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message,
the _UL Interference Overload Indication_ IE indicates the interference level
experienced by the indicated cell ignoring the UL subframe(s) represented as
value "1" in the _Associated Subframes_ IE. The receiving eNB may take such
information into account when setting its scheduling policy and shall consider
the received _UL Interference Overload Indication_ IE value valid until
reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.
If the _UL High Interference Indication_ IE is received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, it indicates, per PRB, the occurrence of high
interference sensitivity, as seen from the sending eNB. The receiving eNB
should try to avoid scheduling cell edge UEs in its cells for the concerned
PRBs. The _Target Cell ID_ IE received within the _UL High Interference
Information_ IE group in the LOAD INFORMATION message indicates the cell for
which the corresponding UL High Interference Indication is meant. The
receiving eNB shall consider the value of the _UL High Interference
Information_ IE group valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message
carrying an update.
If the _Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP)_ IE is received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, it indicates, per PRB, whether downlink transmission
power is lower than the value indicated by the _RNTP_ _Threshold_ IE. The
receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting its
scheduling policy and shall consider the received _Relative Narrowband Tx
Power (RNTP)_ IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message
carrying an update.
If the _ABS Information_ IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION message, the
_ABS Pattern Info_ IE indicates the subframes designated as almost blank
subframes by the sending eNB for the purpose of interference coordination. The
receiving eNB may take such information into consideration when scheduling
UEs.
The receiving eNB may use the _Measurement Subset_ IE received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, for the configuration of specific measurements towards
the UE.
The receiving eNB shall consider the received information as immediately
applicable. The receiving eNB shall consider the value of the _ABS
Information_ IE valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message
carrying an update.
If an ABS indicated in the _ABS pattern info_ IE coincides with a MBSFN
subframe, the receiving eNB shall consider that the subframe is designated as
almost blank subframe by the sending eNB.
If the _Invoke Indication_ IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION message, it
indicates which type of information the sending eNB would like the receiving
eNB to send back. The receiving eNB may take such request into account.
If the _Invoke Indication_ IE is set to \"ABS Information\", it indicates the
sending eNB would like the receiving eNB to initiate the Load Indication
procedure, with the LOAD INFORMATION message containing the _ABS Information_
IE indicating non-zero ABS patterns in the relevant cells. If the _Invoke
Indication_ IE is set to \"Start NAICS Information\", it indicates the sending
eNB would like the receiving eNB to initiate the Load Indication procedure
with the LOAD INFORMATION message containing the _Dynamic DL transmission
information_ IE. The first time the _Dynamic DL transmission information_ IE
is signalled after receiving the _Invoke Indication_ IE set to \"Start NAICS
Information\", all the NAICS parameters in the _NAICS Information_ IE shall be
included. If the _Invoke Indication_ IE is set to \"Stop NAICS Information\",
it indicates the sending eNB does not need NAICS information and therefore the
receiving eNB should stop signalling NAICS parameters for the concerned cell.
If the _NAICS Information_ IE is set to \"NAICS Active\", the receiving eNB
may use it for the configuration of DL interference mitigation assistance
information towards the UE. Information included in the _NAICS Information_ IE
shall replace corresponding NAICS information existing at the receiver. If the
_NAICS Information_ IE is set to \"NAICS Inactive\", the receiving eNB shall
consider the existing NAICS information as invalid.
If the _Intended UL-DL Configuration_ IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION
message, it indicates the UL-DL configuration intended to be used by the
indicated cell. The receiving eNB may take such information into account when
setting its scheduling policy and shall consider the received _Intended UL-DL
Configuration_ IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION
message carrying an update of the same IE.
If the _Extended UL Interference Overload Info_ IE is received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, the _Extended UL Interference Overload Indication_ IE
indicates the interference level experienced by the indicated cell on all
resource blocks, per PRB, in the UL subframe(s) which is represented as value
"1" in the _Associated Subframes_ IE. The receiving eNB may take such
information into account when setting its scheduling policy and shall consider
the received _Extended UL Interference Overload Info_ IE value valid until
reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.
If the _CoMP Information_ IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, the
receiving eNB may take the IE into account for RRM. The receiving eNB shall
consider the _CoMP Information_ IE valid starting in the subframe indicated by
the _Start SFN_ IE and _Start Subframe Number_ IE, if present. If the _Start
SFN_ IE and _Start Subframe Number_ IE are not present, then the receiving eNB
shall consider the _CoMP Information_ IE as immediately valid. The receiving
eNB shall consider the _CoMP Information_ IE valid until an update of the same
IE, received in a new LOAD INFORMATION message, is considered valid.
#### 8.3.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.3.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.3.2 Error Indication
#### 8.3.2.1 General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by an eNB to report detected
errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an
appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE
associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE-associated
signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.2.2-1: Error Indication, successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication
procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the node
detecting the error situation.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the _Cause_ IE or
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE.
In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by UE associated
signalling, in the course of handover signalling and signalling for dual
connectivity, the _Old eNB UE X2AP ID_ IE and the _New eNB UE X2AP ID_ IE
shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of _Old eNB
UE X2AP ID_ IE and _New eNB UE X2AP ID_ IE are not correct, the cause shall be
set to appropriate value e.g. \" unknown Old eNB UE X2AP ID\", \"unknown New
eNB UE X2AP ID\" or \"unknown pair of UE X2AP ID\".
#### 8.3.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.3.2.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
### 8.3.3 X2 Setup
#### 8.3.3.1 General
The purpose of the X2 Setup procedure is to exchange application level
configuration data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over the X2
interface. This procedure erases any existing application level configuration
data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received. This procedure also
resets the X2 interface like a Reset procedure would do.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.3.2-1: X2 Setup, successful operation
An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the X2 SETUP REQUEST message to a
candidate eNB~2~. The candidate eNB~2~ replies with the X2 SETUP RESPONSE
message. The initiating eNB~1~ shall transfer the complete list of its served
cells and, if available, a list of supported GU Group Ids to the candidate
eNB~2~. The candidate eNB~2~ shall reply with the complete list of its served
cells and shall include, if available, a list of supported GU Group Ids in the
reply.
If a cell is switched off for energy savings reasons, it should be activated
before initiating or responding to the X2 Setup procedure and shall still be
included in the list of served cells.
The initiating eNB~1~ may include the _Neighbour Information_ IE in the X2
SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the _Neighbour
Information_ IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The _Neighbour Information_
IE shall only include E-UTRAN cells that are direct neighbours of cells in the
reporting eNB. A direct neighbour of one cell of a given eNB may be any cell
belonging to an eNB that is a neighbour of that given eNB cell e.g. even if
the cell has not been reported by a UE. The initiating eNB~1~ may include the
_TAC_ IE with the _Neighbour Information_ IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message.
The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the _TAC_ IE with the _Neighbour
Information_ IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may
use it according to TS 36.300 [15].
The initiating eNB~1~ may include the _Number of Antenna Ports_ IE in the X2
SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the _Number of
Antenna Ports_ IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE
may use it according to TS 36.331 [9].
The initiating eNB~1~ may include the _PRACH Configuration_ IE in the X2 SETUP
REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the _PRACH
Configuration_ IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE
may use this information for RACH optimisation.
The initiating eNB~1~ may include the _MBSFN Subframe Info_ IE in the X2 SETUP
REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the _MBSFN Subframe
Info_ IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it
according to TS 36.331 [9].
For each CSG cell or hybrid cell served by the initiating eNB~1~ the X2 SETUP
REQUEST message shall contain the _CSG ID_ IE. For each CSG cell or hybrid
cell served by the candidate eNB~2~ the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message shall
contain the _CSG ID_ IE. The eNB receiving the IE shall take this information
into account when further deciding whether X2 handover between the source cell
and the target cell may be performed.
The initiating eNB~1~ may include the _MBMS Service Area Identity List_ IE in
the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the _MBMS
Service Area Identity List_ IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB
receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.300 [15].
For each cell served by the initiating eNB~1~ the X2 SETUP REQUEST message may
contain the _MultibandInfoList_ IE and may also contain the
_FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE. For each cell served by the candidate eNB~2~
the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message may contain the _MultibandInfoList_ IE and may
also contain the _FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE. The eNB receiving the
_MultibandInfoList_ IE shall, if supported, take this information into account
when further deciding whether subsequent mobility actions between the source
cell and the target cell may be performed, and use this IE and the
_FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE, if received, as specified in TS 36.331 [9].
#### 8.3.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.3.3.3-1: X2 Setup, unsuccessful operation
If the candidate eNB~2~ cannot accept the setup it shall respond with an X2
SETUP FAILURE message with appropriate cause value.
If the X2 SETUP FAILURE message includes the _Time To Wait_ IE the initiating
eNB~1~ shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the X2
Setup procedure towards the same eNB~2~.
#### 8.3.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the first message received for a specific TNL association is not an X2
SETUP REQUEST, X2 SETUP RESPONSE, or X2 SETUP FAILURE message then this shall
be treated as a logical error.
If the initiating eNB~1~ does not receive either X2 SETUP RESPONSE message or
X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ may reinitiate the X2 Setup procedure
towards the same eNB, provided that the content of the new X2 SETUP REQUEST
message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged X2 SETUP
REQUEST message.
If the initiating eNB~1~ receives an X2 SETUP REQUEST message from the peer
entity on the same X2 interface:
\- In case the eNB~1~ answers with an X2 SETUP RESPONSE message and receives a
subsequent X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ shall consider the X2
interface as non operational and the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated
according to sub clause 8.3.3.3.
\- In case the eNB~1~ answers with an X2 SETUP FAILURE message and receives a
subsequent X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, the eNB~1~ shall ignore the X2 SETUP
RESPONSE message and consider the X2 interface as non operational.
### 8.3.4 Reset
#### 8.3.4.1 General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to align the resources in eNB~1~ and
eNB~2~ in the event of an abnormal failure. The procedure resets the X2
interface. This procedure doesn't affect the application level configuration
data exchanged during, e.g., the X2 Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.4.2-1: Reset, successful operation
The procedure is initiated with a RESET REQUEST message sent from the eNB~1~
to the eNB~2~. Upon receipt of this message, eNB~2~ shall abort any other
ongoing procedures over X2 between eNB~1~ and eNB~2.~ The eNB~2~ shall delete
all the context information related to the eNB~1~, except the application
level configuration data exchanged during the X2 Setup or eNB Configuration
Update procedures, and release the corresponding resources. After completion
of release of the resources, the eNB~2~ shall respond with a RESET RESPONSE
message.
#### 8.3.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Void.
#### 8.3.4.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the RESET REQUEST message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
another Reset procedure) on the same X2 interface shall be aborted.
If Reset procedure is ongoing and the eNB~2~ receives the RESET REQUEST
message from the peer entity on the same X2 interface, the eNB~2~ shall
respond with the RESET RESPONSE message as described in 8.3.4.2.
If the initiating eNB does not receive RESET RESPONSE message, the eNB~1~ may
reinitiate the Reset procedure towards the same eNB, provided that the content
of the new RESET REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously
unacknowledged RESET REQUEST message.
### 8.3.5 eNB Configuration Update
#### 8.3.5.1 General
The purpose of the eNB Configuration Update procedure is to update application
level configuration data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over
the X2 interface.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.5.2-1: eNB Configuration Update, successful operation
An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message to a peer eNB~2~ . Such message shall include an appropriate set of
up-to-date configuration data, including, but not limited to, the complete
lists of added, modified and deleted served cells, that eNB~1~ has just taken
into operational use.
Upon reception of an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall update the
information for eNB~1~ as follows:
**Update of Served Cell Information:**
\- If _Served Cells To Add_ IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, eNB~2~ shall add cell information according to the information in the
_Served Cell Information_ IE.
\- If _Number of Antenna Ports_ IE is contained in the _Served Cell
Information_ IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ may use this
information according to TS 36.331 [9].
\- If the _PRACH Configuration_ IE is contained in the _Served Cell
Information_ IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB receiving the
IE may use this information for RACH optimisation.
\- If _Served Cells To Modify_ IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, eNB~2~ shall modify information of cell indicated by _Old ECGI_ IE
according to the information in the _Served Cell Information_ IE.
\- If _MBSFN Subframe Info_ IE is contained in the _Served Cell Information_
IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ may use this information
according to TS 36.331 [9]. If a MBSFN subframe indicated in the _MBSFN
Subframe Info_ IE coincides with an ABS, the eNB~2~ shall consider that the
subframe is designated as ABS by the sending eNB.
When either served cell information or neighbour information of an existing
served cell in eNB~1~ need to be updated, the whole list of neighbouring
cells, if any, shall be contained in the Neighbour Information IE.
If the _Deactivation Indication_ IE is contained in _Served Cells To Modify_
IE, it indicates that the concerned cell was switched off to lower energy
consumption.
The eNB~2~ shall overwrite the served cell information and the whole list of
neighbour cell information for the affected served cell.
\- If _Served Cells To Delete_ IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, eNB~2~ shall delete information of cell indicated by _Old ECGI_ IE.
\- If _MBMS Service Area Identity List_ IE is contained in the _Served Cell
Information_ IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB receiving the
IE may use it according to TS 36.300 [15].
When the MBMS Service Area Identities of a cell in eNB1 need to be updated,
the whole list of MBMS Service Area Identities of the affected cell shall be
contained in the _Served Cell Information_ IE.
**Update of GU Group Id List:**
\- If _GU Group Id To Add List_ IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall add the GU Group Id to its GU Group Id List.
\- If _GU Group Id To Delete List_ IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall remove the GU Group Id from its GU Group Id List.
If _Neighbour Information_ IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, eNB~2~ may use this information to update its neighbour cell
relations, or use it for other functions, like PCI selection. The _Neighbour
Information_ IE shall only include E-UTRAN cells that are direct neighbours of
cells in the reporting eNB. A direct neighbour of one cell of a given eNB may
be any cell belonging to an eNB that is a neighbour of that given eNB cell
e.g. even if that cell has not been reported by a UE. The _Neighbour
Information_ IE may contain the _TAC_ IE of the included cells. The receiving
eNB may use _TAC_ IE, as described in TS 36.300 [15].
After successful update of requested information, eNB~2~ shall reply with the
ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to inform the initiating eNB~1~
that the requested update of application data was performed successfully. In
case the peer eNB~2~ receives an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE without any IE
except for _Message Typ_ e IE it shall reply with ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
ACKNOWLEDGE message without performing any updates to the existing
configuration.
The eNB~1~ may initiate a further eNB Configuration Update procedure only
after a previous eNB Configuration Update procedure has been completed.
For each cell served by the initiating eNB1 the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message may contain the _MultibandInfoList_ IE and may also contain the
_FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE. The eNB receiving the _MultibandInfoList_ IE
shall, if supported, take this information into account when further deciding
whether subsequent mobility actions between the source cell and the target
cell may be performed, and use this IE and the _FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE,
if received, as specified in TS 36.331 [9].
**Interaction with the eNB Configuration Update procedure:**
If an eNB~2~ which has not stored a _FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE received
from eNB~1~, but has signaled a _FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE to eNB~1~ after
the TNL association has become available, receives an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message from eNB~1~ containing the _FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE, the eNB~2~
shall initiate the eNB Configuration Update procedure towards eNB~1~ including
the _FreqBandIndicatorPriority_ IE.
#### 8.3.5.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.3.5.3-1: eNB Configuration Update, unsuccessful operation
If the eNB~2~ can not accept the update it shall respond with an ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the _Time To Wait_ IE
the eNB~1~ shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the
eNB Configuration Update procedure towards the same eNB~2~. Both nodes shall
continue to operate the X2 with their existing configuration data.
#### 8.3.5.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB~1~ after initiating eNB Configuration Update procedure receives
neither ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message nor ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ may reinitiate the eNB Configuration Update
procedure towards the same eNB~2~, provided that the content of the new ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously
unacknowledged ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
### 8.3.6 Resource Status Reporting Initiation
#### 8.3.6.1 General
This procedure is used by an eNB to request the reporting of load measurements
to another eNB.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.6.2-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, successful operation
The procedure is initiated with a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message sent from
eNB~1~ to eNB~2~. Upon receipt, eNB~2~ shall initiate the requested
measurement according to the parameters given in the request in case the
_Registration Request_ IE set to \"start\" and shall stop all cells
measurements and terminate the reporting in case the _Registration Request_ IE
is set to "stop\".
If the _Registration Request_ IE is set to \"start\" then the _Report
Characteristics_ IE shall be included in RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message.
The _Report Characteristics_ IE indicates the type of objects eNB~2~ shall
perform measurements on.
For each cell, the eNB~2~ shall include in the RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message:
\- the _Radio_ _Resource Status_ IE, if the first bit, "PRB Periodic" of the
_Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is
set to 1;
\- the **_S1 TNL Load Indicator_** IE, if the second bit, "TNL Load Ind
Periodic" of the _Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message is set to 1;
\- the _Hardware Load Indicator_ IE, if the third bit, "HW Load Ind Periodic"
of the _Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message is set to 1;
\- the _Composite Available Capacity Group_ IE, if the fourth bit, "Composite
Available Capacity Periodic" of the _Report Characteristics_ IE included in
the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1. If _Cell Capacity Class
Value_ IE is included within the _Composite_ _Available Capacity Group_ IE,
this IE is used to assign weights to the available capacity indicated in the
_Capacity Value_ IE;
\- the _ABS Status_ IE, if the fifth bit, "ABS Status Periodic" of the _Report
Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to
1 and eNB~1~ had indicated the ABS pattern to eNB~2;~
\- the _RSRP Measurement Report List_ IE, if the sixth bit, "RSRP Measurement
Report Periodic" of the _Report Characteristics_ IE included in the RESOURCE
STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1..
If the _Reporting Periodicity_ IE is included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message, eNB~2~ shall use its value as the time interval between two
subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE messages that include the _Radio Resource
Status_ IE, _S1 TNL Load Indicator_ IE, _Hardware Load Indicator_ IE,
_Composite Available Capacity Group_ IE, or _ABS Status_ IE.
If the _Reporting Periodicity of RSRP Measurement Report_ IE is included in
the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, eNB~2~ shall use its value as the minimum
time interval between two subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE messages that
include the _RSRP Measurement Report List_ IE.
If eNB~2~ is capable to provide all requested resource status information, it
shall initiate the measurement as requested by eNB~1~, and respond with the
RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.
If eNB~2~ is capable to provide some but not all of the requested resource
status information and the _Partial Success Indicator_ IE is present in the
RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, it shall initiate the measurement for the
admitted measurement objects and include the _Measurement Initiation Result_
IE in the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.
If the eNB~2~ received a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message which includes the
_Registration Request_ IE set to \"stop\", the _Cell To Report_ IE list shall
be ignored.
#### 8.3.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.3.6.3-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, unsuccessful operation
If none of the requested measurements can be initiated, eNB~2~ shall send a
RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message. The _Cause_ IE shall be set to an appropriate
value e.g. \"Measurement Temporarily not Available\" or \"Measurement not
Supported For The Object\" for each requested measurement object. The eNB may
use the _Complete Failure Cause Information_ IE to enhance the failure cause
information per measurement in the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message.
#### 8.3.6.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the initiating eNB~1~ does not receive either RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE
message or RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ may reinitiate the
Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure towards the same eNB, provided
that the content of the new RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is identical to
the content of the previously unacknowledged RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message.
If the initiating eNB~1~ receives the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message
including the _Measurement Initiation Result_ IE containing no admitted
measurements, the eNB~1~ shall consider the procedure as failed.
If the **_Report Characteristics_ IE bitmap is set to** \"**0** \" **(all bits
are set to** \"**0** \"**) in the** RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message **then
eNB~2~ shall initiate a** RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be
set to appropriate value e.g. \"**ReportCharacteristicsEmpty** \".
If the _Reporting Periodicity_ IE value is not specified when at least one of
the bits of the _Report Characteristics_ IE, for which semantics is specified,
other than the sixth bit, is set to 1 **then eNB~2~ shall initiate a**
RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value
e.g. \"**No** ReportPeriodicity\".
If the _Reporting Periodicity of RSRP Measurement Report_ IE value is not
specified when the sixth bit of the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to 1,
then eNB~2~ shall initiate the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message and the cause
shall be set to appropriate value e.g. \"NoReportPeriodicity\".
If the eNB~2~ received a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message which includes the
_Registration Request_ IE set to \"start\" and the _eNB1Measurement ID_ IE
corresponding to an existing on-going load measurement reporting, **then
eNB~2~ shall initiate a** RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be
set to appropriate value e.g. \"ExistingMeasurementID\".
If the _Registration Request_ IE is set to \"stop\" and the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message does not contain _eNB2 Measurement ID_ IE, eNB~2~ shall
consider the procedure as failed and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE
message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. \"Unknown eNB
Measurement ID\".
### 8.3.7 Resource Status Reporting
#### 8.3.7.1 General
This procedure is initiated by eNB~2~ to report the result of measurements
admitted by eNB~2~ following a successful Resource Status Reporting Initiation
procedure.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.7.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.7.2-1: Resource Status Reporting, successful operation
The eNB~2~ shall report the results of the admitted measurements in RESOURCE
STATUS UPDATE message. The admitted measurements are the measurements that
were successfully initiated during the preceding Resource Status Reporting
Initiation procedure, and thus not reported in the _Measurement Failed Report
Characteristics_ IE for the concerned cell in the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE
message.
#### 8.3.7.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.3.7.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB~1~ receives a RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message which includes the
_ABS Status_ IE, and all bits in the _Usable ABS Pattern Info_ IE are set to
\'0\', the eNB1 shall ignore the _DL ABS Status_ IE.
### 8.3.8 Mobility Settings Change
#### 8.3.8.1 General
This procedure enables an eNB to negotiate the handover trigger settings with
a peer eNB controlling neighbouring cells.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.8.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.8.2-1: Mobility Settings Change, successful operation
The procedure is initiated with a MOBILITY CHANGE REQUEST message sent from
eNB~1~ to eNB~2~.
Upon receipt, eNB~2~ shall evaluate if the proposed eNB~2~ handover trigger
modification may be accepted. If eNB~2~ is able to successfully complete the
request it shall reply with MOBILITY CHANGE ACKNOWLEDGE.
#### 8.3.8.3 Unsuccessful Operation

### 8.3.9 Radio Link Failure Indication
#### 8.3.9.1 General
The purpose of the Radio Link Failure Indication procedure is to transfer
information regarding RRC re-establishment attempts, or received RLF Reports,
between eNBs. The signalling takes place from the eNB at which a re-
establishment attempt is made, or an RLF Report is received, to an eNB to
which the UE concerned may have previously been attached prior to the
connection failure. This may aid the detection of radio link failure and
handover failure cases (TS 36.300 [15]).
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.9.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.9.2-1: Radio Link Failure Indication, successful operation
eNB~2~ initiates the procedure by sending the RLF INDICATION message to eNB~1~
following a re-establishment attempt or an RLF Report reception from a UE at
eNB~2~, when eNB~2~ considers that the UE may have previously suffered a
connection failure at a cell controlled by eNB~1~.
eNB~2~ may include the _ShortMAC-I_ IE in the RLF INDICATION message, e.g., in
order to aid the eNB~1~ to resolve a potential PCI confusion situation or to
aid the eNB~1~ to identify the UE.
eNB~2~ may include the _UE RLF Report Container_ IE and optionally also the
_UE RLF Report Container for extended bands_ IE in the RLF INDICATION message,
which may be used by the eNB~1~ to determine the nature of the failure. If the
_UE RLF Report Container_ IE is included in the RLF INDICATION message sent
after successful re-establishment, the eNB~2~ shall use the _Re-establishment
Cell ECGI_ IE in the RLF INDICATION message to indicate the ECGI of the cell
where the re-establishment was successful.
eNB~2~ may include the _RRC Conn Setup Indicator_ IE in the RLF INDICATION
message, which indicates that the RLF Report is retrieved after an RRC
connection setup or an incoming successful handover.
If the _RRC Conn Setup Indicator_ IE is present in the RLF INDICATION message,
the eNB~1~ shall ignore the values in the _Failure cell PCI_ IE, _Re-
establishment cell ECGI_ IE, _C-RNTI_ IE and _ShortMAC-I_ IE.
eNB~2~ may include the _RRC Conn Reestab Indicator_ IE in the RLF INDICATION
message, which may be used by the eNB~1~ to determine where the failure
occurred.
#### 8.3.9.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.3.9.4 Abnormal Conditions

### 8.3.10 Handover Report
#### 8.3.10.1 General
The purpose of the Handover Report procedure is to transfer mobility related
information between eNBs.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.10.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.10.2-1: Handover Report, successful operation
An eNB initiates the procedure by sending an HANDOVER REPORT message to
another eNB. By sending the message eNB~1~ indicates to eNB~2~ that a
mobility-related problem was detected.
If the _Handover Report Type_ IE is set to \"HO too early\" or \"HO to wrong
cell\", then the eNB~1~ indicates to eNB~2~ that, following a successful
handover from a cell of eNB~2~ to a cell of eNB~1~, a radio link failure
occurred and the UE attempted RRC Re-establishment either at the original cell
of eNB~2~ (Handover Too Early), or at another cell (Handover to Wrong Cell).
The detection of Handover Too Early and Handover to Wrong Cell events is made
according to TS 36.300 [15].
If the UE-related information is available in eNB~1~, the eNB~1~ should
include in HANDOVER REPORT message:
\- the _Mobility Information_ IE, if the _Mobility Information_ IE was sent
for this handover from eNB~2~;
\- the _Source cell C-RNTI_ IE.
If received, the eNB~2~ uses the above information according to TS 36.300
[15].
If the UE RLF Report received from the eNB sending the RLF INDICATION message,
as described in TS 36.300 [15], is available, the eNB~1~ may also include it
in the HANDOVER REPORT as _UE RLF Report Container_ IE and optionally also _UE
RLF Report Container for extended bands_ IE.
If the _Handover Report Type_ IE is set to \"InterRAT ping-pong\", then the
eNB~1~ indicates to eNB~2~ that a completed handover from a cell of eNB~2~ to
a cell in other RAT might have resulted in an inter-RAT ping-pong and the UE
was successfully handed over to a cell of eNB~1~ (indicated with _Failure cell
ECGI_ IE).
The report contains the source and target cells, and cause of the handover. If
the _Handover Report Type_ IE is set to \"HO to wrong cell\", then the _Re-
establishment cell ECGI_ IE shall be included in the HANDOVER REPORT message.
If the _Handover Report Type_ IE is set to \"InterRAT ping-pong\", then the
_Target cell in UTRAN_ IE shall be included in the HANDOVER REPORT message.

The purpose of the Cell Activation procedure is to request to a neighbouring
eNB to switch on one or more cells, previously reported as inactive due to
energy saving reasons.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.11.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.11.2-1: Cell Activation, successful operation
An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending a CELL ACTIVATION REQUEST message
to a peer eNB~2~.
Upon receipt of this message, eNB~2~ should activate the cell/s indicated in
the CELL ACTIVATION REQUEST message and shall indicate in the CELL ACTIVATION
RESPONSE message for which cells the request was fulfilled.
**Interactions with eNB Configuration Update procedure:**
eNB~2~ shall not send an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to eNB~1~ just for
the reason of the cell/s indicated in the CELL ACTIVATION REQUEST message
changing state, as the receipt of the CELL ACTIVATION RESPONSE message by
eNB~1~ is used to update the information about cell activation state of eNB~2~
cells in eNB~1~.
#### 8.3.11.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.3.11.3-1: Cell Activation, unsuccessful operation
If the eNB~2~ cannot activate any of the cells indicated in the CELL
ACTIVATION REQUEST message, it shall respond with a CELL ACTIVATION FAILURE
message with an appropriate cause value.

### 8.3.12 X2 Removal
#### 8.3.12.1 General
The purpose of the X2 Removal procedure is to remove the signaling connection
between two eNBs in a controlled manner. If successful, this procedure erases
any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signaling.
#### 8.3.12.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.12.2-1: X2 Removal, successful operation
An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the X2 REMOVAL REQUEST message to
a candidate eNB~2~. Upon reception of the X2 REMOVAL REQUEST message the
candidate eNB~2~ shall reply with the X2 REMOVAL RESPONSE message. After
receiving the X2 REMOVAL RESPONSE message, the initiating eNB~1~ shall
initiate removal of the TNL association towards eNB~2~ and may remove all
resources associated with that signaling connection. The candidate eNB~2~ may
then remove all resources associated with that signaling connection.
#### 8.3.12.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.3.12.3-1: X2 Removal, unsuccessful operation
If the candidate eNB~2~ cannot accept to remove the signaling connection with
eNB~1~ it shall respond with an X2 REMOVAL FAILURE message with an appropriate
cause value.

transport of an X2AP message (except the X2AP MESSAGE TRANSFER message)
between two eNBs and to allow an eNB to perform registration.
## 8.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.5.2-1: X2AP Message Transfer, successful operation
eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the X2AP MESSAGE TRANSFER message to
eNB~2~.
Upon the reception of X2 MESSAGE TRANSFER message the target eNB may:
\- Retrieve the X2AP message included in the _X2AP Message_ IE;
\- Consider the target eNB ID contained in the _Target eNB ID_ IE, included in
the _RNL Header_ IE, as the destination for the X2AP message signaled in the
_X2AP Message_ IE;
\- Consider the source eNB ID contained in the _Source eNB ID_ IE, included in
the _RNL Header_ IE, as the source of the X2AP message signaled in the _X2AP
Message_ IE.
In case the included RNL Header IE does not contain the Target eNB ID IE, the
receiving eNB shall consider the eNB ID included in the Source eNB ID IE as
the eNB ID corresponding to the TNL address(es) of the sender and update its
internal information.

## 8.6 Procedures for Dual Connectivity
### 8.6.1 SeNB Addition Preparation
#### 8.6.1.1 General
The purpose of the SeNB Addition Preparation procedure is to request the SeNB
to allocate resources for dual connectivity operation for a specific UE.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.6.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.6.1.2-1: SeNB Addition Preparation, successful operation
The MeNB initiates the procedure by sending the SENB ADDITION REQUEST message
to the SeNB. When the MeNB sends the SENB ADDITION REQUEST message, it shall
start the timer T~DCprep~.
The allocation of resources according to the values of the _Allocation and
Retention Priority_ IE included in the _E-RAB Level QoS Parameters_ IE shall
follow the principles described for the E-RAB Setup procedure in TS 36.413
[4].
If the SENB ADDITION REQUEST message contains the _Serving PLMN_ IE, the SeNB
may use it for RRM purposes.
The SeNB shall report to the MeNB, in the SENB ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message, the result for all the requested E-RABs in the following way:
\- A list of E-RABs which are successfully established shall be included in
the _E-RABs Admitted To Be Added List_ IE.
\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be established shall be included in the
**_E-RABs Not Admitted List_** IE.
For each E-RAB configured with the SCG bearer option
\- the SeNB shall choose the ciphering algorithm based on the information in
the _UE Security Capabilities_ IE and locally configured priority list of AS
encryption algorithms and apply the key indicated in the _SeNB Security Key_
IE as specified in the TS 33.401 [18].
\- the MeNB may propose to apply forwarding of downlink data by including the
_DL Forwarding_ IE within the _E-RABs To be Added Item_ IE of the SENB
ADDITION REQUEST message. For each E-RAB that it has decided to admit, the
SeNB may include the _DL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ IE within the _E-RABs
Admitted To Be Added Item_ IE of the SENB ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
to indicate that it accepts the proposed forwarding of downlink data for this
bearer. This GTP tunnel endpoint may be different from the corresponding _DL
GTP TEID_ IE in the _E-RAB To Be Modified List_ IE of the E-RAB MODIFICATION
INDICATION message (see TS 36.413 [4]) depending on implementation choice.
\- the SeNB may include for each bearer in the _E-RABs Admitted To Be Added
List_ IE the _UL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ IE to indicate that it
requests data forwarding of uplink packets to be performed for that bearer.
Upon reception of the SENB ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the MeNB shall

In case the request modification cannot be performed successfully the MeNB
shall respond with the SENB MODIFICATION REFUSE message to the SeNB with an
appropriate cause value in the _Cause_ IE.
The MeNB may also provide configuration information in the _MeNB to SeNB
Container_ IE.
#### 8.6.4.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the timer T~DCoverall~ expires before the SeNB has received the SENB
MODIFICATION CONFIRM or the SENB MODIFICATION REFUSE message, the SeNB shall
regard the requested modification as failed and may take further actions like
triggering the SeNB initiated SeNB Release procedure to release all SeNB
resources allocated for the UE.
If the MeNB is aware that the SeNB didn't receive the latest configuration
information concerning the MCG, the MeNB may respond with the SENB
MODIFICATION REFUSE message to the SeNB with an appropriate cause value in the
_Cause_ IE.
If the value received in the _E-RAB ID_ IE of any of the _E-RABs To Be
Released Items_ IE is not known at the MeNB, the MeNB shall regard the
procedure as failed and may take appropriate actions like triggering the MeNB
initiated SeNB Release procedure.
**Interaction with the MeNB initiated SeNB Modification Preparation
procedure:**
If the SeNB, after having initiated the SeNB initiated SeNB Modification
procedure, receives the SENB MODIFICATION REQUEST message including other IEs
than an applicable _SeNB Security Key_ IE and/or applicable forwarding
addresses and/or the _SCG Change Indication_ IE the SeNB shall
\- regard the SeNB initiated SeNB Modification Procedure as being failed,
\- stop the T~DCoverall~, which was started to supervise the SeNB initiated
SeNB Modification procedure,
\- be prepared to receive the SENB MODIFICATION REFUSE message from the MeNB
and
\- continue with the MeNB initiated SeNB Modification Preparation procedure as
specified in section 8.6.3.
### 8.6.5 MeNB initiated SeNB Release
#### 8.6.5.1 General
The MeNB initiated SeNB Release procedure is triggered by the MeNB to initiate
the release of the resources for a specific UE.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.6.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.6.5.2-1: MeNB initiated SeNB Release, successful operation
The MeNB initiates the procedure by sending the SENB RELEASE REQUEST message.
Upon reception of the SENB RELEASE REQUEST message the SeNB shall stop
providing user data to the UE. The _SeNB UE X2AP ID_ IE shall be included if
it has been obtained from the SeNB. The MeNB may provide appropriate
information within the _Cause_ IE.
If the bearer context in the SeNB was configured with the SCG bearer option,
for each SCG bearer for which the MeNB requests forwarding of uplink/downlink
data, the MeNB includes the _UL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ / _DL
Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ IE within the _E-RABs To Be Released Item_ IE
of the SENB RELEASE REQUEST message to indicate that the SeNB should perform
data forwarding of uplink/downlink packets for that SCG bearer.
If the bearer context in the SeNB was configured with the split bearer option,
for each Split bearer for which the MeNB requests forwarding of downlink data,
the MeNB includes the _DL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ IE within the _E-
RABs To Be Released Item_ IE of the SENB RELEASE REQUEST message to indicate
that the SeNB should perform data forwarding of downlink packets for that
split bearer.

## 9.2 Information Element definitions
### 9.2.0 General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit
strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of
the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to
the ordering of bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
\- When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.
### 9.2.1 GTP Tunnel Endpoint
The _GTP Tunnel Endpoint_ IE identifies an X2 transport bearer or the S-GW
endpoint of the S1 transport bearer associated to an E-RAB. It contains a
Transport Layer Address and a GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier. The Transport
Layer Address is an IP address to be used for the X2 user plane transport (see
TS 36.424 [8]) or for the S1 user plane transport (see TS 36.414 [19]). The
GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier is to be used for the user plane transport
between eNB and the S-GW or between eNBs.

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table.
In general, \"not supported\" cause values indicate that the concerned
capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\" cause values
indicate that the concerned capability is present, but insufficient resources
were available to perform the requested action.
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Radio Network Layer cause | Meaning | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Cell not Available | The concerned cell is not | | | available. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Handover Desirable for Radio | The reason for requesting | | Reasons | handover is radio related. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Handover Target not Allowed | Handover to the indicated target | | | cell is not allowed for the UE | | | in question | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Invalid MME Group ID | The target eNB doesn't belong to | | | the same pool area of the source | | | eNB i.e. S1 handovers should be | | | attempted instead. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | No Radio Resources Available in | The target cell doesn't have | | Target Cell | sufficient radio resources | | | available. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | **Partial Handover** | Provides a reason for the | | | handover cancellation. The | | | target eNB did not admit all | | | E-RABs included in the HANDOVER | | | REQUEST and the source eNB | | | estimated service continuity for | | | the UE would be better by not | | | proceeding with handover towards | | | this particular target eNB. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Reduce Load in Serving Cell | Load in serving cell needs to be | | | reduced. When applied to | | | handover preparation, it | | | indicates the handover is | | | triggered due to load balancing. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Resource Optimisation Handover | The reason for requesting | | | handover is to improve the load | | | distribution with the neighbour | | | cells. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Time Critical Handover | Handover is requested for time | | | critical reason i.e. this cause | | | value is reserved to represent | | | all critical cases where the | | | connection is likely to be | | | dropped if handover is not | | | performed. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | TX2~RELOCoverall~ Expiry | The reason for the action is | | | expiry of timer | | | TX2~RELOCoverall~. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | T~RELOCprep~ Expiry | Handover Preparation procedure | | | is cancelled when timer | | | T~RELOCprep~ expires. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Unknown MME Code | The target eNB belongs to the | | | same pool area of the source eNB | | | and recognizes the MME Group ID. | | | However, the MME Code is unknown | | | to the target eNB. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Unknown New eNB UE X2AP ID | The action failed because the | | | _New_ _eNB UE X2AP ID_ _or the | | | MeNB UE X2AP ID is_ unknown. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Unknown Old eNB UE X2AP ID | The action failed because the | | | _Old_ _eNB UE X2AP ID_ _or the | | | SeNB UE X2AP ID is_ unknown. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Unknown Pair of UE X2AP ID | The action failed because the | | | pair of UE X2 AP IDs is unknown. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Encryption And/Or Integrity | The target eNB is unable to | | Protection Algorithms Not | support any of the encryption | | Supported | and/or integrity protection | | | algorithms supported by the UE. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | **ReportCharacteristicsEmpty** | The action failed because there | | | is no characteristic reported. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | **No** ReportPeriodicity | The action failed because the | | | periodicity is not defined. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | ExistingMeasurementID | The action failed because | | | measurement-ID is already used. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Unknown eNB Measurement ID | The action failed because some | | | eNB _Measurement-ID is_ unknown. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Measurement Temporarily not | The eNB can temporarily not | | Available | provide the requested | | | measurement object. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Load Balancing | The reason for mobility settings | | | change is load balancing. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Handover Optimisation | The reason for mobility settings | | | change is handover optimisation. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Value out of allowed range | The action failed because the | | | proposed Handover Trigger | | | parameter change in the eNB~2~ | | | Proposed Mobility Parameters IE | | | is too low or too high. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Multiple E-RAB ID Instances | The action failed because | | | multiple instances of the same | | | E-RAB had been provided to the | | | eNB. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Switch Off Ongoing | The reason for the action is an | | | ongoing switch off i.e. the | | | concerned cell will be switched | | | off after offloading and not be | | | available. It aides the | | | receiving eNB in taking | | | subsequent actions, e.g. | | | selecting the target cell for | | | subsequent handovers. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Not supported QCI value | The action failed because the | | | requested QCI is not supported. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Unspecified | Sent when none of the above | | | cause values applies but still | | | the cause is Radio Network Layer | | | related. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Measurement not Supported For | At least one of the concerned | | The Object | cell(s) does not support the | | | requested measurement. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | T~DCoverall~ Expiry | The reason for the action is | | | expiry of timer T~DCoveral~l. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | T~DCprep~ Expiry | The reason for the action is | | | expiry of timer T~DCprep~. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Action Desirable for Radio | The reason for requesting the | | Reasons | action is radio related.\ | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Reduce Load | Load in the cell(group) served | | | by the requesting node needs to | | | be reduced.\ | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Resource Optimisation | The reason for requesting this | | | action is to improve the load | | | distribution with the neighbour | | | cells.\ | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Time Critical action | The action is requested for time | | | critical reason i.e. this cause | | | value is reserved to represent | | | all critical cases where radio | | | resources are likely to be | | | dropped if the requested action | | | is not performed.\ | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Target not Allowed | Requested action towards the | | | indicated target cell is not | | | allowed for the UE in question. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | No Radio Resources Available | The cell(s) in the requested | | | node don't have sufficient radio | | | resources available. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Invalid QoS combination | The action was failed because of | | | invalid QoS combination. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Encryption Algorithms Not | The requested eNB is unable to | | Supported | support any of the encryption | | | algorithms supported by the UE.\ | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Procedure cancelled | The sending node cancelled the | | | procedure due to other urgent | | | actions to be performed. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | RRM purpose | The procedure is initiated due | | | to node internal RRM purposes. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Improve User Bit Rate | The reason for requesting this | | | action is to improve the user | | | bit rate. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | User Inactivity | The action is requested due to | | | user inactivity on all E-RABs, | | | e.g., S1 is requested to be | | | released in order to optimise | | | the radio resources; or SeNB | | | didn't see activity on the DRB | | | recently. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Radio Connection With UE Lost | The action is requested due to | | | losing the radio connection to | | | the UE. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Failure in the Radio Interface | Radio interface procedure has | | Procedure | failed. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Bearer Option not Supported | The requested bearer option is | | | not supported by the sending | | | node. | | | | | | In the current version of this | | | specification applicable for | | | Dual Connectivity only. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.3.1 General
X2AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [27] and ITU-T Rec. X.681
[28].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the X2AP protocol with ASN.1.
In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause
and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take
precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of
conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of X2AP messages.
X2AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct an X2AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules:
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE: In the above, \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID.
If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different
occurrences have different IE IDs.
If an X2AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
### 9.3.2 Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be
part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor
inter-operability.
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.
