# 1 Scope
The objective of this study [20] is to evaluate the use of measurements for
positioning, which are currently specified for UE and eNodeB for other
purposes but are not currently included in LPP and LPPa, for an RF pattern
matching positioning technology in LTE.\ The RFPM performance with these
measurements will be compared to the RFPM performance based on the
measurements currently specified for the E-CID location method.
The implementation could be an E-SMLC based eNodeB-assisted location service
using existing E-UTRAN measurements which are provided to the E-SMLC via the
LPPa positioning protocol and UE-assisted location service using existing UE
measurements (RSRP, RSRQ and UE Rx-Tx time difference only) which are provided
to the E-SMLC via LPP positioning protocol.
The present document is intended to complement already 3GPP standardized
location methods and existing 3GPP location work items.

# 4 General description of RF Pattern Matching (RFPM)
Radio Frequency Pattern Matching (RFPM) sometimes referred to as RF
fingerprinting, is a general class of positioning techniques by which a set of
RF measurements, made either by the UE or the eNB, is compared against a
reference set of values in order to estimate the UE location, where the
reference set of values may be based on predicted and/or collected
measurements. Typical types of RF measurements include signal strength
measurements and timing measurements. In LTE, the signal strength measurements
would correspond to Referenced Signal Received Power (RSRP) while the timing
measurements may correspond to the UE Rx-Tx measurement. By increasing the
number of measurements of a good quality from different sectors the location
accuracy will improve. Different methods exist for location estimation for
RPFM and for obtaining reference measurements; these methods are typically
implementation specific.
# 5 LTE architecture for RFPM
Implementation of RFPM may rely on the fundamental location architecture as
described in 3GPP TS 36.305 [9], where a positioning server is E-SMLC in the
control plane or SLP in the user plane, and positioning protocols LPP and LPPa
would facilitate gathering the needed information to perform a location
estimate.
# 6 Simulation methodology
## 6.1 Overview
The goal of the study is to evaluate the RFPM positioning performance. This
evaluation includes a baseline performance characterisation where only
existing measurements available in the E-CID Positioning Method are used as
well as enhancements to RFPM where low interference conditions and inter-RAT
measurements are included.
In order to do the performance characterization of each scenario RFPM is
simulated using system level simulations (optionally link level simulations).
The general flow is outlined in the following steps:
(1) Generate RF maps for each sector in the network in accordance with
parameters specified clause 6.5.1;
(2) Randomly place UEs in the network;
(3) Compute the corresponding interference based on the given scenario for
each UE;
(4) For each UE simulate the UE Rx-Tx measurement and the RSRP measurement;
a. In scenarios with inter-RAT measurements, simulate also measurements
corresponding to other RATs.
(5) Using RFPM compute the position estimate;
(6) For each UE, calculate the error comparing the estimated position obtained
in Step 5 to the actual position.
## 6.2 Network topology
The network topology is a macro network deployment as in 3GPP TR 36.814 [13].
## 6.3 Location methods to be simulated
A baseline performance for RFPM is established by simulating the performance
using just those measurements available in LPP / LPPa for E-CID .
Specifically, these measurements are intra-frequency RSRP, and UE Rx-Tx time
difference.
The measurements are as specified in 3GPP TS 36.214 [12].
Two additional scenarios will be evaluated to assess the performance
improvement offered to RFPM:
● Intra-frequency RSRP and UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements performed in
subframes with reduced interference (e.g. without any data traffic in
interfering cells)
● Intra-frequency RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference and on inter-RAT measurement,
with an emphasis placed on GSM as the additional RAT.
The RFPM simulation will use the maximum likelihood method for deriving the
location estimate.\ The position estimation approach for RFPM is as in Annex
A.
## 6.4 Error models
### 6.4.1 RFPM error model
RFPM works by comparing a set of measurements against a model of the RF
environment. As such, it is important to characterize the error that exists
both in the RFPM model but also in the UE measurements.
Two types of errors are modelled in the RFPM simulation studies:
● prediction and reference data error (includes e.g. prediction error, model
fitting error, reference data error, etc.)
● real-time measurement error (includes e.g. measurement accuracy requirement
3GPP TS 36.133 [8], terminal carrier error, body impact, etc.)
In the former case the error may have several sources such as prediction error
(i.e. the fidelity in which one can accurately predict the RF environment) and
reference data error (i.e. if field measurements are used to improve the
prediction, their intrinsic measurement error must also be included). Figure
6.4.1-1 highlights how these two error mechanisms work with what is the actual
RF environment in a simulation.
Figure 6.4.1-1: RFPM error models
For the purposes of simulation a RF map is generated for each cell in
accordance with the parameters outlined in clause 6.5.1. The RFPM model error
is assumed to be normally distributed and has two components as it may be the
case that some portion of the time we select the wrong RF model parameters for
the environment:
● e1: RMS = 9 dB (for 90% of randomly select UEs)
● e2: RMS = 13 dB (for 10% of randomly selected UEs)
For the simulated UE measurements the error must account for not only the
intrinsic measurement error from the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 36.133 [8],
but also the possibility that the UE may be oriented in different ways with
respect to the user yielding head/body effects on the actual measurements in
relation to the RF environment. It is also true that the UE error performance
will be better in low interference conditions than in high interference
conditions.\ Hence, two scenarios are captured, both assuming normally
distributed errors:
● RMS = 6.5 dB (normal subframes at full system load)
● RMS = 5.7 dB (subframes with reduced interference)
## 6.5 Simulation assumptions

# 7 Simulation results and observations
Simulation results are presented in this clause for the following scenarios:
● **Scenario 1:** (baseline): based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in
full-load conditions,
● **Scenario 2:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in reduced-
interference subframes,
● **Scenario 3:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in full-load
conditions and GSM RSSI measurements,
● **Scenario 4:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in reduced-
interference subframes and GSM RSSI measurements,
● **Scenario 5:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in full-load
conditions and UMTS CPICH RSCP measurements,
● **Scenario 6:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in reduced
interference subframes and UMTS CPICH RSCP measurements,
● **Scenario 7:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in reduced
interference subframes, UMTS CPICH RSCP measurements and GSM RSSI
measurements,
● **Scenario 8** : based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in full-load
conditions and UMTS CPICH RSCP measurements during IPDL,
● **Scenario 9:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in reduced
interference subframes and UMTS CPICH RSCP measurements during IPDL and,
● **Scenario 10:** based on LTE measurements (RSRP and UE Rx-Tx) in reduced
interference subframes, UMTS CPICH RSCP measurements during IPDL, and GSM RSSI
measurements.
Several observations can be made based on the results of the simulation study:
● **Observation 1:** When LTE measurements are made in low-interference
subframes the performance improves significantly. In the urban 10 MHz case the
67^th^ percentile error is reduced 30% while in the suburban 10 MHz case the
67^th^ percentile error is reduced 47%.
● **Observation 2:** Including GSM RSSI measurements adds some improvement to
the RFPM performance.\ In the urban 10 MHz case the 67^th^ percentile error is
reduced 11% while in the suburban 10 MHz case the 67^th^ percentile error is
reduced 23%.
● **Observation 3:** Combining both the GSM RSSI measurement enhancement and
the LTE measurements in low-interference subframe enhancement in an urban 10
MHz condition reduces the 67^th^ percentile error by 37% while it reduces the
suburban 10 MHz 67^th^ percentile error by 54%.
● **Observation 4:** Adding UMTS inter-RAT measurements shows improvement
albeit not quite to the extent of the GSM inter-RAT scenario. When UMTS intra-
RAT measurements are made during IPDL periods the results are improved over
the full-load LTE with GSM inter-RAT scenario (Scenario 3).
● **Observation 5:** Combining UMTS inter-RAT and GSM inter-RAT along with LTE
measurements in low-interference subframes yields the greatest performance
impact decreasing the 67^th^ percentile error 44% and 47% for the cases when
the UMTS inter-RAT measurements aren\'t made and are made during IPDL
respectively.
● **Observation 6:** The grid spacing influences the performance of RFPM, as
evidenced by a 2%-6% increase in the baseline 67^th^ percentile error when
moving from 10 meter bin spacing to 50 meter bin spacing when comparing same
company results. However, the relative performance improvements offered when
LTE measurements are made in reduced-interference subframes or when GSM RSSI
or UMTS RSCP measurements are included hold.
## 7.1 Urban 10 MHz bandwidth case
Table 7.1-1 provides company averaged simulation results for the baseline
(scenario 1), reduced interference subframe (scenario 2), GSM inter-RAT
(scenario 3), and combined reduced interference subframe and GSM inter-RAT
(scenario 4) for 10 MHz bandwidth in an urban environment. The results
establish the improvements offered by both the studied enhancements, which,
when combined reduce the overall 67^th^ percentile error by 36%.

## 7.2 Urban 1.4 MHz bandwidth case
One result for this case is in Figure 7.2-1. The absolute performance is
degraded due to the lower bandwidth, however, the relative improvements for
each of the studied scenarios remains consistent with the 10 MHz scenario.
Examining the 67^th^ percentile error we see a decrease in the error of 39%,
20%, and 50% for scenarios 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

One result for this case is presented in Figure 7.3-1 and summarized in Table
7.3-1. The absolute performance is degraded due to the larger cell spacing,
however, significant gains are observed in each of the studied scenarios.
Examining the 67^th^ percentile error we see a decrease in the error of 47%,

## 7.4 Suburban 1.4 MHz bandwidth case
One result is presented for this case in Figure 7.4-1 and summarized in Table
7.4-1. The absolute performance is degraded due to the larger cell spacing and
lower bandwidth, however, significant gains are observed in each of the
studied scenarios. Examining the 67^th^ percentile error we see a decrease in
the error of 45%, 19%, and 51% for scenarios 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

## 7.5 Urban 10 MHz bandwidth case with 50 meter bins
The last case studied examines the effects of changing the resolution of the
underlying grid used to model the network. In this case, the resolution is
changed from 10 meters to 50 meters for a 10 MHz bandwidth urban network.\ The
increased bin size yields a slightly degraded performance. This result is
perhaps expected due to the increased quantization error introduced by moving
to larger grid spacing. However, the relative improvement offered by each
studied enhancement holds.

# 8 Impact to the E-UTRA specifications
The basic RFPM functionality is already possible to support by implementation,
based on the existing positioning measurements and procedures standardized
since 3GPP Rel-9.
In addition, two key enhancements have been evaluated in this study:
(1) Signal measurements during reduced interference subframes
(2) Inclusion of Inter Radio Access Technology (Inter-RAT) measurements
## 8.1 Signal measurements during reduced interference subframes
There are several approaches that can be used to support this enhancement.
To enable positioning measurements in reduced-interference subframes, the UE
would need to know when such subframes occur and adapt its measurements
accordingly.
**Positioning subframes** is one example of reduced-interference subframes.
Positioning subframes are configured via LPP for RSTD measurements with OTDOA
positioning. With the current standard, however, the UE is not expected to
perform RSRP or UE Rx-Tx measurements in such positioning subframes only, even
when the positioning subframe configuration is known to the UE via LPP.
**ABS subframes** in heterogeneous deployments is another example of reduced-
interference subframes. Measurement resource restriction patterns are
configured via RRC and once the UE is configured with such a pattern, it would
perform the RSRP and UE Rx-Tx measurements accordingly. Thus, requesting RSRP,
RSRQ, or UE Rx-Tx measurements for E-CID via LPPa by positioning node and then
configuring the measurements and a measurement resource restriction pattern
via RRC by the serving eNodeB is a possible implementation solution.
Thus, the RFPM enhancement based on reduced interference subframes in the form
of ABS subframes used for RFPM seems to be already possible with LPPa-based
E-CID positioning via implementation, with no additional standard impact. A
shortcoming of this implementation may be that not all UEs supporting E-CID
positioning may be supporting measurements in ABS subframes.
Using positioning subframes for E-CID which currently are used for OTDOA only
would provide more flexibility but would also require some protocol changes to
either the E-CID or OTDOA positioning method defined in 3GPP TS 36.355 [11]
and 3GPP TS 36.455 [10] along with an update to the stage 2 positioning
specifications in 3GPP TS 36.305 [9].\ It would also need to be decided
whether the signal measurements in positioning subframes would be performed
based on CRS or PRS.
## 8.2 Addition of inter-RAT measurement reporting
The second enhancement that has been evaluated also has multiple
implementations.\ The inter-RAT measurement reporting could be standardized as
a part of E-CID positioning method.\ From the signalling and protocol
procedure enhancement perspective, if this is done in LPPa, there is an impact
on 3GPP TS 36.455 [10] and 3GPP TS 36.305 [9]. If this enhancement is to be
specified for LPP, there is a corresponding impact on 3GPP TS 36.355 [11] and
3GPP TS 36.305 [9], 3GPP TS 36.355 [11].\ In both ways, there is also an
impact on UE complexity, which needs to be further assessed, and potentially
UE requirements in 3GPP TS 36.133 [8].\ Extending the inter-RAT capability to
include UMTS measurements made during IPDL would require some additional
changes at least to 3GPP TS 36.331 [14], 3GPP TS 36.355 [11], 3GPP TS 36.455
[10], and 3GPP TS 36.133 [8].
# 9 Conclusions
The basic RFPM functionality is already possible to support by implementation,
based on the existing positioning measurements and procedures standardized
since 3GPP Rel-9.
This study focused on two enhancements to RFPM in LTE:
(1) LTE measurements performed in reduced-interference subframes;
(2) LTE measurements combined with additional inter-RAT measurements.
Each proposed enhancement effectively improves the positioning geometry by
providing additional measurements. When the UE makes measurements in reduced
interference conditions the number of observable or hearable neighbours is
improved significantly. Such reduced interference subframes already exist,
e.g., in LTE OTDOA positioning in the form of positioning subframes in which
Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) may be transmitted.
Similarly, using inter-RAT measurements not only adds additional measurements
but the measurements are from a different radio access technology that may
have a significantly different interference environment than that of the LTE
network, improving the positioning geometry.
Based on average results, the gains with LTE measurements in reduced-
interference conditions are up to 30% and the gains from using GSM
measurements are up to 23%. Using UMTS measurements show similar gains to that
of GSM.
Based on these results the following recommendations are made:
● Rel-12 to include that E-CID RSRP and RSRQ measurements are performed in
positioning subframes, to exploit the lower interference conditions. Such
measurements shall be optional for the UE.
● Rel-12 to include support for inter-RAT measurements for E-CID positioning
method such that inter-RAT measurements are optionally available for the
purposes of positioning.
It is worth noting that, although this study focused on RFPM positioning, the
above enhancements have a potential to improve the performance of any
positioning technique that uses the E-CID positioning procedures and
protocols.
###### ### Annex A: RFPM location estimation algorithm
An example location estimation approach that may be used for RFPM is described
below.
Assume that we have a predicted database of RSRP and TA measurements for a 2
dimensional set of locations (pixels). Given a measurement vector, we will
compute the following expression for each pixel:
The denominators in the above expression denote measurement error variances
and can be computed from the measurement error samples observed during link
level simulations. The RFPM location estimate is then the location of the
pixel that minimizes the above expression.
