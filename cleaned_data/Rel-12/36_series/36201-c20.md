# 4 General description of LTE Layer 1
## 4.1 Relation to other layers
### 4.1.1 General Protocol Architecture
The radio interface described in this specification covers the interface
between the User Equipment (UE) and the network, and sidelink transmissions
between UEs. The radio interface is composed of the Layer 1, 2 and 3. The TS
36.200 series describes the Layer 1 (Physical Layer) specifications. Layers 2
and 3 are described in the 36.300 series.
{width="5.291666666666667in" height="2.0729166666666665in"}
Figure 1: Radio interface protocol architecture around the physical layer
Figure 1 shows the E-UTRA radio interface protocol architecture around the
physical layer (Layer 1). The physical layer interfaces the Medium Access
Control (MAC) sub-layer of Layer 2 and the Radio Resource Control (RRC) Layer
of Layer 3. The circles between different layer/sub-layers indicate Service
Access Points (SAPs). The physical layer offers a transport channel to MAC.
The transport channel is characterized by how the information is transferred
over the radio interface. MAC offers different logical channels to the Radio
Link Control (RLC) sub-layer of Layer 2. A logical channel is characterized by
the type of information transferred.
### 4.1.2 Service provided to higher layers
The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers. The access
to these services is through the use of a transport channel via the MAC sub-
layer. The physical layer is expected to perform the following functions in
order to provide the data transport service:
\- Error detection on the transport channel and indication to higher layers
\- FEC encoding/decoding of the transport channel
\- Hybrid ARQ soft-combining
\- Rate matching of the coded transport channel to physical channels
\- Mapping of the coded transport channel onto physical channels
\- Power weighting of physical channels
\- Modulation and demodulation of physical channels
\- Frequency and time synchronisation
\- Radio characteristics measurements and indication to higher layers
\- Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna processing
\- Transmit Diversity (TX diversity)
\- Beamforming
\- RF processing. (Note: RF processing aspects are specified in the TS 36.100
series)
## 4.2 General description of Layer 1
### 4.2.1 Multiple Access
The multiple access scheme for the LTE physical layer is based on Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) in the
downlink, and on Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA)
with a cyclic prefix in the uplink and sidelink. To support transmission in
paired and unpaired spectrum, two duplex modes are supported: Frequency
Division Duplex (FDD), supporting full duplex and half duplex operation, and
Time Division Duplex (TDD).
The Layer 1 is defined in a bandwidth agnostic way based on resource blocks,
allowing the LTE Layer 1 to adapt to various spectrum allocations. A resource
block spans either 12 sub-carriers with a sub-carrier bandwidth of 15kHz or 24
sub-carriers with a sub-carrier bandwidth of 7.5kHz each over a slot duration
of 0.5ms.
The radio frame structure type 1 is used for FDD (for both full duplex and
half duplex operation) and has a duration of 10ms and consists of 20 slots
with a slot duration of 0.5ms. Two adjacent slots form one sub-frame of length
1ms. The radio frame structure type 2 is used for TDD and consists of two
half-frames with a duration of 5ms each and containing each either 10 slots of
length 0.5ms, or 8 slots of length 0.5ms and three special fields (DwPTS, GP
and UpPTS) which have configurable individual lengths and a total length of
1ms. A sub-frame consists of two adjacent slots, except for sub-frames, which
consist of DwPTS, GP and UpPTS, namely sub-frame 1 and, in some
configurations, sub-frame 6. Both 5ms and 10ms downlink-to-uplink switch-point
periodicity are supported. Further details on the LTE frame structure are
specified in [2]. Adaptation of the uplink-downlink subframe configuration via
Layer 1 signalling is supported.
To support a Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS), LTE offers the
possibility to transmit Multicast/Broadcast over a Single Frequency Network
(MBSFN), where a time-synchronized common waveform is transmitted from
multiple cells for a given duration. MBSFN transmission enables highly
efficient MBMS, allowing for over-the-air combining of multi-cell
transmissions in the UE, where the cyclic prefix is utilized to cover the
difference in the propagation delays, which makes the MBSFN transmission
appear to the UE as a transmission from a single large cell. Transmission on a
dedicated carrier for MBSFN with the possibility to use a longer CP with a
sub-carrier bandwidth of 7.5kHz is supported as well as transmission of MBSFN
on a carrier with both MBMS transmissions and point-to-point transmissions
using time division multiplexing. Transmission of PDSCH also in MBSFN
subframes that are not used for MCH is supported.
Transmission with multiple input and multiple output antennas (MIMO) are
supported with configurations in the downlink with up to eight transmit
antennas and eight receive antennas, which allow for multi-layer downlink
transmissions with up to eight streams. Multi-layer uplink transmissions with
up to four streams are supported with configurations in the uplink with up to
four transmit antennas and four receive antennas. Multi-user MIMO, i.e.
allocation of different streams to different users is supported in both UL and
DL.
Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission and reception are supported,
including the possibility to configure a UE with multiple Channel State
Information (CSI) feedback processes.
Aggregation of multiple cells is supported in the uplink and downlink with up
to five serving cells, where each serving cell can use a transmission
bandwidth of up to 110 resource blocks and can operate with either frame
structure type 1 or frame structure type 2. Dual connectivity to groups of
serving cells that belong to two different eNode-Bs is also supported.
Sidelink transmissions are defined for ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct
Communication between UEs. The sidelink transmissions use the same frame
structure as uplink and downlink when the UEs are in network coverage;
however, the sidelink transmissions are restricted to a sub-set of the uplink
resources.
### 4.2.2 Physical channels and modulation
The physical channels defined in the downlink are:
\- the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH),
\- the Physical Multicast Channel (PMCH),
\- the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH),
\- the Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel (EPDCCH),
\- the Relay Physical Downlink Control Channel (R-PDCCH),
\- the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH),
\- the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH)
\- and the Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH).
The physical channels defined in the uplink are:
\- the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH),
\- the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH),
\- and the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH).
The physical channels defined in the sidelink are:
\- the Physical Sidelink Broadcast Channel (PSBCH),
\- the Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH),
\- the Physical Sidelink Discovery Channel (PSDCH),
\- and the Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH).
In addition, signals are defined as reference signals, primary and secondary
synchronization signals, and discovery signals.
The modulation schemes supported are:
\- QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM in the uplink,
\- QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM in the downlink,
\- QPSK and 16QAM in the sidelink.
### 4.2.3 Channel coding and interleaving
The channel coding scheme for transport blocks in LTE is Turbo Coding with a
coding rate of R=1/3, two 8-state constituent encoders and a contention-free
quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) turbo code internal interleaver.
Trellis termination is used for the turbo coding. Before the turbo coding,
transport blocks are segmented into byte aligned segments with a maximum
information block size of 6144 bits. Error detection is supported by the use
of 24 bit CRC. Further channel coding schemes for BCH and control information
are specified in [3].
### 4.2.4 Physical layer procedures
There are several Physical layer procedures involved with LTE operation. Such
procedures covered by the physical layer are;
\- Cell search
\- Power control
\- Uplink synchronisation and Uplink timing control
\- Random access related procedures
\- HARQ related procedures
\- Relay related procedures
\- ProSe related procedures
Through the control of physical layer resources in the frequency domain as
well as in the time and power domains, implicit support of interference
coordination is provided in LTE.
### 4.2.5 Physical layer measurements
Radio characteristics are measured by the UE and the eNode-B and reported to
higher layers in the network. These include, e.g. measurements for intra- and
inter-frequency handover, inter RAT handover, timing measurements and
measurements for RRM and in support for positioning.
Measurements for inter-RAT handover are defined in support of handover to GSM,
UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, CDMA2000 1x RTT, CDMA2000 HRPD and IEEE 802.11.
