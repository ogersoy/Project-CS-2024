# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for LTE Advanced Dual Uplink Inter-
band Carrier Aggregation under Rel-12 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS
side. The document is divided in two different parts:
\- Common part: this part covers general BS and UE issues for all CA classes.
\- CA class part: this part covers each CA class in parallel clauses. For each
CA class, general part for this specific CA class and each band combination
with specific issues will be structured in separate sub-clauses.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the rapporteur of
each WI to ensure that the TPs related to the WI have been implemented.
# 5 Dual Uplink Inter-band Carrier Aggregation: CA classes general part
## 5.1 BS specific
Since current 2UL inter-band CA classes are specified from UE point of view
and should be agnostic to BS implementation that supports CA, it is envisioned
that the current BS requirements shall remain unchanged. However, the
applicability of requirements depends on the BS type. A typical implementation
is that different RF modules are used for different bands, thus single band
requirements shall apply in this case. For some close band combinations, if
multi-band receiver is declared to receive both uplink carriers, the
exclusions and provisions in RX requirements for BS capable of multi-band
operation shall apply.
## 5.2 UE specific
### 5.2.1 UE Coexistence requirements for Dual UL CA when the aggregated bands
are from different regions
Most dual-uplink inter-band CA combinations are from the same regions as shown
in table 5.2.1-1. But some inter-band CA combinations are from the inter-
regions such as B1+B5, B3+B5 and B4+B7 combinations.

For the 1UL/2DL inter-band CA UE, the aggressor signal is generated in 1 UL
band same as rel-8/9 UE. So it is possible to follow the conventional UE-to-UE
coexistence requirements that are described in table 6.6.3.2-1[5]. However,
the frequency range of emission level for IMD and Harmonic from 2UL inter-band
CA needs to be analyzed and measured to determine the adjacent UE coexistence
requirements.
From the e-mail discussion after RAN4 #68 meeting, there was consensus to add
the inter-regions bands in the protected band lists in table 6.6.3.2-1 [5] for
single UL UE as follow.

To define the protected band lists for inter-region issues, we used option 5
in [6].
\- Option5) Choose a subset of protected frequency ranges/bands to protect
based on spectrum allocations in the countries where the two bands are
deployed

From the table5.2.1-3 and 5.2.1-4, we can define the protect band lists for
1UL coexistence requirements as shown in table 5.2.1-2.
For the 2ULs inter-band CA UE, same approach to define the protected band
lists can be applied.
A general harmonics and IMD coexistence analysis table for inter-band CA with
2UL is given in table 5.2.1-5. For UE-UE coexistence, it is sufficient to
consider only up to 3^rd^ order intermodulation.

When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 5.2.1-6 is given which is for the general
IMD/harmonics analysis to coexist with ISM bands and GNSS system. From this
table, the harmonics and IMD issues can be summarized.

### 5.2.2 Dual Uplink CA intermodulation analysis
Two different RF front-end architectures are analysed, one with common
diplexer and one without common diplexer. We analyse the impact of switch,
diplexer and duplexer. It has to be noted that the component linearity really
plays a key role here; choosing overly pessimistic or overly optimistic values
one can get of course very different results. We used pretty neutral data in
this analysis.
There can be also other mechanism of intermodulation than these analysed in
this contribution. We did not present intermodulation calculations for the
entire RF front-end chain because those calculations would have been quite
extensive. Instead we calculated the intermodulation of each component that
gives accurate enough results.
#### 5.2.2.1 Intermodulation with "common diplexer" based UE RF front-end
architecture
Figure 5.2.2.1-1 below shows an example of common diplexer based RF front-end
architecture.
Figure 5.2.2.1-1: Common diplexer based RF Front-end architecture
**Intermodulation in antenna switch** :
Figure 5.2.2.1-2 below illustrates the contributors of intermodulation. In
this example, band L1 transmission is attenuated by the diplexer. Attenuated
L1 transmission is seen at the antenna switch output. H1 transmission is seen
at the antenna switch input. The intermodulation products generated in the
antenna switch are seen at the antenna. Depending on the frequency, they are
attenuated by the diplexer. In this analysis we analyse the case when
intermodulation is not attenuated by the diplexer that is worse case from
emissions perspective.
Figure 5.2.2.1-2: Contributors of intermodulation
The following formulas can be used to calculate IMD2 and IMD3:
Where $\left| a \right| + \left| b \right| = 2$and $P_{1},P_{2}$are
fundamental and aggressor Power levels [dBm]
Where $\left| a \right| + \left| b \right| = 3$ and $P_{1},P_{2}$are
fundamental and aggressor Power levels [dBm]
In this analysis we used the following numerical values for these parameters:
Note that $P_{1}$is H1 TX in figure 5.2.2.1-2 and $P_{2}$is attenuated L1 TX.
L1 TX was assumed to be 20dBm and diplexer attenuation (very worst case) 10dB.
Thus $P_{2}$became 20dBm-10dBm=10dBm. There exists a lot of variation
in$\text{IIP}_{2}$and $\text{IIP}_{3}$performance. The values we present in
this analysis are assumed to be pretty "safe" i.e. they are not overly
optimistic. The switch performance can be significantly better in practice.
Inserting these values into formulas we get the following intermodulation
products at the antenna switch output:
If the above values would be shown in dBm/1MHz format, they would naturally be
even lower. For instance -60dBm $P_{\text{IMD}2}$assuming 5MHz channel BW's
would be roughly -68dBm/1MHz in worst place (in the middle of intermodulation
frequency). Thus there is quite a lot of margin to -50dBm/1MHz emission limit.
**OBSERVATION 1: There is quite a lot of margin to -50dBm/1MHz emission
limit**
**Intermodulation in diplexer:**
Figure 5.2.2.1-3 below depicts the situation. Intermodulation is generated by
L1 TX and H1 TX.
Figure 5.2.2.1-3:
We were not able to get vendor verified data about diplexer intermodulation.
In discussions with component vendors this mechanism was not seen to be a big
issue, anyhow the real performance must be further studied.
**OBSERVATION2: This mechanism is not seen as a big problem but the real
performance must be anyhow further studied**
#### 5.2.2.2 Intermodulation with "no common-diplexer" based RF front-end
architecture
**Single TX antenna RF front-end architecture:**
Figure 5.2.2.2-1 below shows an example of common diplexer based RF front-end
architecture.
Figure 5.2.2.2-1: No common diplexer based RF Front-end architecture
Figure 5.2.2.2-2 below illustrates the contributors of intermodulation. In
this example, bands are combined with a diplexer that is then connected to
antenna switch. The analysis would be similar if L1-H1 band combination were
implemented using a quadplexer.
Figure 5.2.2.2-2: the contributors of intermodulation
In this analysis we used the following numerical values for these parameters:
Note that $P_{1}$is H1 TX in figure 5.2.2.2-2 and $P_{2}$ is L1 TX. Different
to earlier example, now L1 TX is not attenuated and is thus 20dBm.
Inserting these values into formulas we get the following intermodulation
products at the antenna switch output:
If the above values would be shown in dBm/1MHz format, they would naturally be
even lower. For instance -50dBm $P_{\text{IMD}2}$assuming 5MHz channel BW's
would be roughly -58dBm/1MHz in worst place (in the middle of intermodulation
frequency). Thus there is still some margin to -50dBm/1MHz emission limit.
**OBSERVATION3: There is some margin to -50dBm/1MHz emission limit**
**Dual TX antenna RF architecture:**
Figure 5.2.2.2-3: Dual TX antenna architecture
The antenna to antenna isolation is typically around 10dB. Figure 5.2.2.2-3
above illustrates how aggressor transmission couples to the antenna switch.
The aggressor is attenuated by the amount of antenna to antenna isolation.
Thus the values are the following
Inserting these values into formulas we get the following intermodulation
products at the antenna switch output:
**OBSERVATION 4: There is quite a lot of margin to -50dBm/1MHz emission
limit**
#### 5.2.2.3 Duplexer and quadplexer intermodulation
Duplexers generate intermodulation as well. In figure 5.2.2.3-1, attenuated H1
TX is the aggressor.
Figure 5.2.2.3-1: Duplexer intermodulation
Diplexer attenuates H1 by at least 10dB. We used measurement data from
randomly chosen low band duplexer to derive $\text{IIP}_{2}$and
$\text{IIP}_{3}$values. We assumed 4dB post PA loss. It has to be noted that
these values are examples only and they should not be used as "minimum" or
"maximum" duplexer performance values. The values we used are:
Inserting these values into formulas we get the following intermodulation
products at the duplexer output:
Looking at the intermodulation powers, there is margin to -50dBm/1MHz
especially in case of $P_{\text{IMD}2}$even if the intermodulation product
generated in the duplexer were at such a frequency that it were not attenuated
by the diplexer. Even in the case of $P_{\text{IMD}3}$there is roughly 14dB
margin to -50dBm/1MHz assuming 5MHz channel BW's. Like earlier said, results
are initial and duplexer linearity was obtained from only one randomly chosen
component.
**OBSERVATION5: There is some margin to -50dBm/1MHz emission limit**
Figure 5.2.2.3-2 illustrates another possible intermodulation born mechanism
when two duplexers are matched together (=quadplexer).
Figure 5.2.2.3-2: Quadplexer intermodulation
If the matching were perfect, then L2 should be seen as open port in L1
passband. In practice this is not always the case and thus L2 generates
intermodulation in duplexer with L1. The level of L2 attenuation is very
difficult to precisely estimate. The ultimate imaginary worst case would
naturally be that there would be no attenuation at all. In that case the
aggressor TX would be at 20dBm power level, 10dBm higher than in figure
5.2.2.3-1. Respectively, $P_{\text{IMD}2}$and $P_{\text{IMD}3}$would be 10dBm
higher. Anyhow there has to be significant attenuation in practice or the
quadplexer would not operate at all. Thus, in practice it is quite safe to
assume that case in figure 5.2.2.3-1 is worse case than in figure 5.2.2.3-2.
**OBSERVATION6: When two duplexers are matched together (quadplexer) the
intermodulation generated by any of these duplexers does not violate
-50dBm/1MHz emission limit.**
### 5.2.3 Dual Uplink CA Passive intermodulation measurements
#### 5.2.3.1 Passive intermodulation measurement for CA class A1
To analyze the IMD from passive components, we assume the typical values of RF
components as follows
● Aggregated maximum output power = 23dBm with 0dB MPR
▪ PA gain = 27dB, PA IIP3 =40dB
● Tx/Rx RF component IL = 3.5dB
▪ 3.5dB (ANT SW: 0.5dB, Diplexer :0.5dB, Duplexer: 2.5dB)
● FE coupling loss = 40dB
● Antenna loss =10dB
● Diplexer Characteristics: Band 1- Band 5 isolation : 20dB
● Duplexer Characteristics: Tx-Rx isolation: 50dB, Tx-Ant isolation : 35 dB
(824-849MHz)
For the 2UL inter-band CA, the input signal level induced from the other
operating Band Y into Band X through Duplexer/Diplexer/Switch/Quadplexer is
quite high. That is derived in Eq. 5-1.
The leakage signals level at RF Components of Band X (Eq. 5-1)
S1 (Blue line) = PA output power of Band Y - Tx RF component loss of Band Y
--Rx RF component loss of Band X
Figure5.2.3.1-1: Class A1: Examples of the signal level at passive/active
components
In Figure 5.2.3.1-1, we denoted the point where passive IMD can be generated
as point A, B and C to compare with active IMD at point P.
For the passive IMD analysis, we assume the input signal level from Band Y to
Band X on these RF components at Duplexer, switch and Diplexer as follow
i) Duplexer Passive IMD (point A): consider the 23dBm input signal from Band X
and -1dBm input signal from Band Y
ii) Switch Passive IMD (point B): consider the 20.5dBm input signal from Band
X and -0.5dBm input signal from Band Y
iii) Diplexer Passive IMD (point C): consider the 20dBm input signal from Band
X and 20dBm input signal from Band Y
So, we measured the passive IMD level with aid of RF component vendors. Table
5.2.3.1-1 \~ 5.2.3.1-5 provides the measured data of PIM for Duplexer,
Diplexer and Switch components.

#### 5.2.6.2 Transmit OFF power
For dual ul interband CA UE the Transmit OFF power requirements is set to -50
dBm per transmitted carrier / MBW when the power on both UL carriers is set to
the transmit OFF power level.
This can be specified by adding following highlighted text into 36.101
**\ **
#### 5.2.6.3 ON/OFF time mask
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the general output power ON/OFF
time mask specified in subclause 6.3.4.1 is applicable for each component
carrier during the ON power period and the transient periods. The OFF period
as specified in subclause 6.3.4.1 shall only be applicable for each component
carrier when all the component carriers are OFF. Dual uplink inter-band CA
shall follow the same way to define ON/OFF time mask due to the sharing
antenna connector between the two bands.
This can be specified by adding following highlighted text into 36.101.
**\ **
#### 5.2.6.4 Power Control
##### 5.2.6.4.1 Absolute power tolerance
For dual uplink inter-band carrier aggregation, the absolute power control
tolerance is specified on each component carrier exceed the minimum output
power as defined in subclause 6.3.2A and the total power is limited by maximum
output power as defined in subclause 6.2.2A. The requirements defined in Table
6.3.5.1.1-1 shall apply on each component carrier with both component carriers
active. The requirements can be tested by time aligning any transmission gaps
on both the component carriers.
##### 5.2.6.4.2 Relative power tolerance
For dual uplink inter-band carrier aggregation, the relative power tolerance
is specified on each component carrier exceed the minimum output power as
defined in subclause 6.3.2A and the total power is limited by P~UMAX~ as
defined in subclause 6.2.5A. The requirements shall apply on each component
carrier with both component carriers active. The UE transmitter shall have the
capability of changing the output power independently on all component
carriers in the uplink and:
a) the requirements for all combinations of PUSCH and PUCCH transitions per
component carrier is given in Table 6.3.5.2.1-1.
b) for SRS the requirements for combinations of PUSCH/PUCCH and SRS
transitions between subframes given in Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 apply per component
carrier when the target and reference subframes are configured for either
simultaneous SRS or simultaneous PUSCH.
c) for RACH the requirements apply for the primary cell and are given in Table
6.3.5.2.1-1.
##### 5.2.6.4.3 Aggregate power control tolerance
For dual uplink inter-band carrier aggregation, the aggregate power tolerance
is specified on each component carrier exceed the minimum output power as
defined in subclause 6.3.2A and the total power is limited by maximum output
power as defined in subclause 6.2.2A. The requirements defined in Table
6.3.5.3.1-1 shall apply on each component carrier with both component carriers
active. The requirements can be tested by time aligning any transmission gaps
on both the component carriers.
### 5.2.7 Transmit signal quality and intermodulation
Since each band is expected to have its own transmitter for 2UL inter-band CA,
transmit signal quality and transmit intermodulation requirement shall not be
affected by the carrier from different band. To guarantee existing RF
performance, these two requirements shall be kept unchanged for each band in
2UL inter-band CA. The requirements shall apply on each component carrier with
both component carriers active.
#### 5.2.7.1 Frequency error in CA
For inter-band carrier UL aggregation the frequency error requirements defined
in frequency error section apply per component carrier.
### 5.2.8 Output RF spectrum emissions
For 2UL inter-band CA, multiple carriers from different band transmit through
a common antenna simultaneously, which means the spurious emission application
range should exclude out-of-band emission frequency range and channel
frequency range of all carriers. The figure below illustrates the spectrum
emissions application range for 2UL inter-band CA.
For occupied bandwidth, general spurious emission requirement, existing
requirement for each carrier could also be reused for 2UL inter-band CA. The
requirements shall apply on each component carrier with both component
carriers active.
Figure 5.2.8-1: Transmitter RF spectrum for inter-band CA 2UL
#### 5.2.8.1 SEM requirements
Currently, RAN4 has assumed two RF front-end architectures for 2ULs inter-band
CA as shown in Figure 5.2.8.1-1. In both cases, individual RF chain is used
for each PCell and SCell, respectively.
Figure 5.2.8.1-1: Examples of 2ULs inter-band CA architectures
And also from the 2ULs inter-band CA combination under discussion in Table
5.2.8.1-1, the minimum band gap is observed in B2+B4 of Class A4, which is
95MHz. So the conventional SEM requirements in Rel-8/9 can be reused for the
SEM of 2ULs inter-band CA.

In 2ULs inter-band CA band combinations in future release, if band gap between
two bands is less than sum of ∆f~OOB_X~ and ∆f~OOB_Y~, the SEM requirements
allowing higher PSD level for emissions is chosen as intra-band NC CA case.
From the observation, we propose as follow
**Proposal 1: The SEM requirement for 2UL CA should be the same as that in
Rel-8/9 if band-gap is larger than** ∆f~OOB_CBW_X~ + ∆f~OOB_CBW_Y~**.**
**Proposal 2 : The higher PSD levels of SEM of two individual carrier should
be applied in the overlapped region if band-gap is smaller than**
∆f~OOB_CBW_X~ + ∆f~OOB_CBW_Y~**.**
#### 5.2.8.2 ACLR requirements
In the figure 5.2.8.2-1, we showed two cases for ACLR requirements for 2ULs
inter-band CA. For current inter-band combinations, all deployments scenarios
falls into case 1 in Figure 5.2.8.2-1 due to the large band gaps as shown in
table 5.2.8.1-1. BW~GAP~ is frequency gap between the upper frequency of low
UL CC and the lower frequency of high UL CC.
Figure 5.2.8.2-1: ACLR requirements for 2ULs inter-band CA
However, when considering 2ULs inter-band CA in future release such that if
band gap between is less the supported channel BW as shown in the case2 and
case3 of Figure 5.2.8.2-1, RAN4 can follow the ACLR requirements for intra-
band non contiguous CA in TR36.823.
Therefore, the typical possible solution can be proposed as follow
**Proposal 3: For UTRA~ACLR1~ and UTRA~ACLR2~**
**▪ UTRA~ACLR1~ is required to be met in the band gap when the gap bandwidth
BW~GAP~ is 5MHz ≤ BW~GAP~.**
**▪ Both UTRA~ACLR1~, UTRA~ACLR2~ are required to be met in the gap when the
gap bandwidth BW~GAP~ is 15MHz≤ BW~GAP~**
**● Proposal 4: For E-UTRA~ACLR~**
**▪ E- UTRA~ACLR~ adjacent channel power measurement bandwidth equals the
channel bandwidth that it is adjacent to.**
**▪ In case the band gap is smaller than other of the channel bandwidth then
for that channel bandwidth no E-UTRA~ACLR~ requirement is set for the band
gap.**
**▪ In case the band gap is smaller than either of the channel bandwidths then
no E- UTRA~ACLR~ requirement is set for the band gap.**
#### 5.2.8.3 Dual Uplink CA UE Coexistence requirements
For inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink assigned to two E-UTRA
bands the requirements in Table 5.2.8.3-1 applies for CA_1A-5A UE as an
example. We note that CA_1A-5A does not provide protection of Band 27 beyond
SEM.
NOTE: The requirements in 2 UL inter-band CA UE to UE co-existence table could
be verified by measuring spurious emissions [at least] at the specific
frequencies where second and third order intermodulation products generated by
the two transmitted carriers can occur; in that case, the requirements for
remaining applicable frequencies in 2 UL inter-band CA UE to UE co-existence
table would be considered to be verified by the measurements verifying the 1
UL inter-band CA UE to UE co-existence requirements.

### 5.2.9 Dual uplink Intermodulation and harmonics analysis for UE self-
downlink performance
When two transmitters are transmitting simultaneously, two uplinks would
generate intermodulation products and harmonics at multiple places at front-
end of the transceiver. When harmonics and intermodulation products fall into
UE self DL spectrum, they may desensitize receiver performance significantly
for existing H/H, L/L and H/L band combinations. Initially, only 2^nd^ and
3^rd^ orders of harmonics and IMDs have been considered for UE self-
desensitization~~.~~ However, further studies have shown that 4^th^ and 5^th^
orders of IMDs may also cause relevant self-desensitization. The meanwhile,
3^rd^ order harmonics is the highest order that needs to be considered for FDD
2UL inter-band CA, due to FDD band spectrum allocation. Therefore, a table is
established to examine 2UL inter-band CA harmonics up to 3^rd^ order and IMDs
up to 5^th^ order, as presented in Table 5.2.9-1. One thing worth mentioning
is that this table is intended to examine on LTE band level. Once a CA
combination is identified as the one with harmonics and/or IMDs in the DL
band(s), further investigation is required for identifying if this specific CA
combination would be impacted by self-desensitization based on its spectrum
allocation/deployment. Further identification, such as MSD, needs to be
investigated, based on individual CA case.

* * *
It is realized that IMD products with the sum of frequency components would
not cause self-desensitization, such as 2~~x~~_f_ x + 1~~x~~_f_ y or 3~~x~~_f_
x +1~~x~~_f_ y for Band x and Band y. Therefore only IMD products with the
difference of frequency components are listed in Table 5.2.9-1, such as I
2~~x~~_f_ x - 1~~x~~_f_ y I and I 3~~x~~_f_ x - 1~~x~~_f_ y I.
A thorough examination is conducted by applying Table 5.2.9-1 to existing 2UL
inter-band CA combinations. Table 5.2.9-2 lists the information of CA
combinations where harmonics and IMDs can fall into its own downlink band(s).
The information listed in Table 5.2.9-2 is based on general band-to-band
analysis. When IMD issue is not identified with specific FDD spectrum
deployment, this table could be updated with further study.

### 6.1.2 UE receiver requirement for Class A1
Reference sensitivity is defined to be met with both downlink carriers active
and either one of the uplink carriers active for 1UL inter-band CA. For 2UL
inter-band CA, reference sensitivity shall be specified with both carriers
transmitting simultaneously, interference comes from both the uplink CCs in
each band.
For 2UL inter-band CA class A1, the TX and RX frequency separation between two
different bands is much larger than that for the same band, which generally
means larger attenuation will be provided for TX noise from the other band. In
addition, if the two bands share a common antenna a diplexer across the low
and high bands is also assumed in the reference structure for CA class A1.
Based on the previous study, minimum 15dB isolation between two bands could be
realized for the diplexer in current band combinations. If the two bands have
separate antennas, 10dB antenna isolation is also assumed between two bands.
Therefore, the residual noise from the other uplink CC could be neglected.
For other receiver requirement like ACS, blocking, spurious response, and
intermodulation requirements in 1UL inter-band CA, the single active uplink
carrier is the opposite to the downlink carrier being tested when both
downlink carriers are active. It means current requirements shall be met with
either of the uplink carrier active. Considering the isolation between two
bands, it is also expected that impact on other RX requirements due to 2UL can
be neglected for class A1.

##### 6.2.1.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_1A-5A with 2ULs
For the analysis of 2UL inter-band CA 1A-5A UE, we should study and analyze
the inter-modulation products and harmonics products when both Band 1 and Band
5 with 2ULs are transmitting simultaneously.
The combination of Band 1 and Band 5 has harmonics frequencies that are far
away from the components receive and transmit frequencies, in the UL and in
the DL of the CA combination, as shown in table 6.2.1.1.2-1. So there was no
harmonic issue except Band 41. In the conventional SE for UE-to-UE coexistence
requirements, the 3^rd^ harmonics of Band 5 UE already fall into B41 DL band,
but exceptions for SE measurements are permitted if there is at least one
individual RB within the transmission bandwidth for which the 2^nd^, 3^rd^ or
4^th^ harmonic totally or partially overlaps the measurement bandwidth (MBW)
[3].
Also, the inter-modulation products for CA_1A-5A UE with 2 ULs as shown in
table 6.2.1.1.2-1. None of the IMD products fall into the own CA_1A-5A UE
receive bands. But, 2-tone 3^rd^ IMD products may have impact on the Band 22
DL, Band 42 DL and 43 DL bands. But Band 22, Band 42 and Band 43 are far away
from Band1 and Band 5, so we can assume that the UE front-end filter can
effectively attenuate these IMD products.

For the connectivity radios (WLAN, BT etc. in ISM bands) and positioning
systems (GPS, Galileo, Glonass, Compass, etc), RAN4 analyzed the impact of the
IMD/Harmonic from dual-uplink CA transmission in Table 6.2.1.1.2-2. From the
analysis table, WLAN system has some harmonics problems in 5GHz and 2.4GHz by
3^rd^ harmonics from each Band 1 and Band5, respectively.

##### 6.2.1.1.3 Analysis of IMD4 products
The IMD4 products for 2ULs CA_1A-5A UE are shown in table 6.2.1.1.3-1. The
two-tone IMD4 products by \|2*fx_low --2* fy_high\| to \|2*fx_high --
2*fy_low\| fall into the own CA_1A-5A UE receive bands. And also 2-tone IMD4
products may have impact on the Band 4 DL, Band 10 DL and 23 DL bands. But
Band 4, Band 10 and Band 23 are not deployed in the same region with CA_1A-5A
UE.

To analyze the IMD4 products on PA components, we assume the typical values of
RF components as follows
● CA Channel BW : 10MHz + 10MHz
● RB Allocation for worst scenario: Victim band (1 RB), Aggressor band (1 RB)
● Aggregated maximum output power : 25dBm with 2dB tolerance
● Tx/Rx RF component IL : 3.5dB
▪ 3.5dB = sum(ANT SW: 0.5dB, Diplexer :0.5dB, Duplexer: 2.5dB)
● FE coupling loss : 40\~70dB
● Antenna loss :10dB
● Diplexer Characteristics: 20dB for Band 1- Band 5 isolation
● Duplexer Characteristics: Tx-Rx isolation: 50dB, Tx-Ant isolation : 35 dB
For example, in the 2UL inter-band CA_1A-5A, the leakage from Band 5 into Band
1 can be modelled with two paths which are depicted in Figure 6.2.1.1.3-1. The
first path (blue line) is general interference signal from band 5
transmission, which level is estimated to be about -34dBm considering general
duplexer, diplexer and antenna loss. And the second path (yellow line) is
generated by cross coupling effect through PCB which is quite dependent on the
UE implementation.
Figure 6.2.1.1.3-1 Example of input signal level to generate the IMD4 at PA
components
This two leakages are described as Eq. 6.2.1.1.3-1 and Eq. 6.2.1.1.3-2 :
  * **The leakage signal level at "P" :**
> **S1 (Blue line) = PA output power of Band 5 - Tx RF component loss of Band
> 5 --Rx RF component loss of Band 1 = -34dBm/CBW** (Eq. 6.2.1.1.3-1)
>
> **S2 (Yellow Line) = PA output power of Band 5 -- Coupling loss (30\~70dB) =
> 25-(40\~70) = -15 \~ -45 dBm/CBW** (Eq. 6.2.1.1.3-2)
In Figure 6.2.1.1.3-1, the "P" is the point where IMD4 can be generated by two
different signal paths (blue path and yellow path). But the input signal level
by coupling loss in PA (yellow path) is more critical than the general
interference signal by reversed RF path (blue path). That is to say, assuming
coupling loss of 50 dB to evaluate the IMD4 signal level in PA, the input
signal level of Band 1 PA is about -25dBm which is 9dB higher than the general
interference signal level of -34dBm by reversed RF path in blue line.
Figure 6.2.1.1.3-2. IMD measurement setup by coupling loss at PA output in
Case1
So, we can measure the IMD4 level by coupling loss as shown in Figure
6.2.1.1.3-2 [2]. The measurement results are shown in Table 6.2.1.1.3-2 and
6.2.1.1.3-3 according two test cases.

From Table 6.2.1.1.3**-** 2, we can see that the IMD4 level has quite an
impact on the Band 1 DL frequency range (8^th^ column) considering coupling
loss of equal or less than 50 dB. From Table 6.2.1.1.3**-** 3, the most
measured IMD4 levels (7^th^ column) are higher than those of Case1. But the
frequency range of IMD4 in Case2 is not directly related to the own DL
frequency of band 1 and band 5. And also the measured IMD4 level by \|3*fx-
1*fy\| is a bit higher than IMD4 level by \|2*fx-2*fy\|, but the difference is
small.
We can analyze impact on the REFSENS with this measurement. To do this, we
consider the B1 duplexer attenuation to be 50dB. Then the estimated REFSENS
degradation is:
\- Desense level for 2ULs UE = Conventional thermal noise level -- (Thermal
noise + Interference level of IMD4 products)
> = -104dBm -- (10\^(-10.4) +10\^( -7.93)) = -104dBm -- (-79.285 dBm)
>
> = -24.71dB (Eq. 6.2.1.1.3**-** 3)
From the IMD4 measurements and REFSENS analyses, we can summarize the self
desensitisation levels in Table 6.2.1.1.3**-** 4 according to the coupling
loss for Case 1.
Table 6.2.1.1.3-4: Self-desensitization in Band 1 by coupling loss for 2ULs
CA_1A-5A UE
* * *
Coupling factor (dB) Desensitization (dB) 40 45.10 45 34.80 50 24.71 55 13.98
60 6.27 65 1.27 70 0.55
* * *
So we can see that IMD4 impact is negligible on REFSENS of Band 1, when
coupling loss is over the 70dB.
But, from the discussion paper [3], IMD4 from B1+B5 would not be falling into
Band 1 DL spectrum when we assume maximum 20MHz channel bandwidth per each
band and fixed Tx-Rx separation. So RAN4 needs not define any MSD level for
2ULs CA_1A-5A UE.
**Observation1: For the CA_1A-5A UE, RAN4 needs not consider the MSD level for
Band 1 assuming maximum 20MHz channel bandwidth per each bands and fixed Tx-Rx
separation.**
##### 6.2.1.1.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For the class A1 UE with 2ULs simultaneous transmission, additional insertion
loss is introduced by diplexer, which can impact to the maximum output power
and reference sensitivity level. Generated IMD products and harmonics from 2UL
inter-band CA 1A-5A UE do not impact to its own DL frequency bands. The
insertion loss of the diplexer has been reported by the RF filter vendors as
following Table 6.2.1.1.4-1.
Table 6.2.1.1.4-1: Reported ILs for CA_1A-5A diplexer

0.45 5 0.36 0.49 0.45 0.35 0.3
* * *
For the reported IL values there was no or only marginal difference for the
Tx/Rx paths reported. Table 6.2.1.1.4-2 shows the average IL

The inter-band CA combination CA_3A-20A does not have 2nd, 3rd or 5th order
intermodulation problems into its own DL as shown in Table 6.3.3-1 and
Table6.3.3-3. IMD4 can cause intermodulation distortion to the own band 20 and
band 3 DL, Table 6.3.3-2.
Table 6.3.3-4 lists B3 and B20 protected bands for UE co-existence which are
affected by harmonics or IMDs from B3 + B20 CA.
When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.3.3-5 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics

RAN4 agreed on the following in order to deal with possible harmonic and IMD
problems for 2ULs:
● For UE-UE coexistence, it is sufficient to consider only up to 3^rd^ order
intermodulation [11].
● For harmonics and IMD problems in ISM bands, RAN4 should not consider an
additional insertion loss for filtering solutions compared to 1UL inter-band
CA [12].
● From RAN4#69 forward approve proposals that reuse single uplink inter-band
CA ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values for those dual uplink inter-band CA band
combinations that don\'t have 2nd/3rd/5th order intermodulation problem with
own DL [13].
● RAN4 shall consider 4^th^ and 5^th^ order intermodulation if falling into
the own receiving band, R4-140575, R4-141259 and R4-69AH-0030.

# 7 Class A2. Low-high band combination with harmonic relation between bands
In accordance with the way forward agreement R4-69AH-0091, we propose to reuse
the Tx and Rx relations for class A2 combinations from 1UL to 2UL. The Tx and
Rx relaxations agreed for 1UL were derived based on a \"shared-pain\"
principle applied to the additional insertion loss of a diplexer as well as
the harmonic trap filter in the low band needed to suppress the level of the
transmitted harmonic.
The reference sensitivity for 2UL class A2 combinations is also agreed to be
specified by MSD. This is similar to how reference sensitivity is specified
for 1UL class A2 since the interference mechanism leading to MSD is the same.
It is expected that the same RF front-end hardware will be used for 2UL as for
1UL for A2 combinations. Therefore, the insertion losses and linearity
specifications for the components will be the same.
For 2UL CA, one possible difference is that the power at the output of the low
band PA may be lower than for single carrier since the composite power of the
two transmitters is bound by P~CMAX~. However, since the output power of each
component carrier is allowed to be power controlled separately, it is still
possible that most of the output power is assigned to the low band. The impact
of reduced Tx power per CC depends on the distribution of 3rd harmonic
generation throughout the entire transmit and receive chain as well as
coupling across the PCB and on-chip. With the inclusion of a harmonic trap
filter attenuating the 3rd harmonic spur at the output of the duplexer, it is
estimated that the difference in MSD when considering equal power transmission
in each CC is only 0.5 dB. With unequal power transmission, the difference
will be even smaller.
Table 7-1: Third harmonic MSD for single transmission and for dual
transmission with power split equally to each CC.
* * *
                      5 MHz   10 MHz
Single Tx -90 -89.5 2 Tx, equal power -90.5 -90
* * *
Therefore, we propose that the H3 interference and therefore the MSD will be
approximately the same between 1UL and 2UL and that the same specifications
can be reused.

The inter-band CA combination CA_4A-12A has 3rd harmonic problems into its own
DL as shown in Table 7.3.1.2-1.and IMD4 may little partly fall into band 4 DL
base on Table 7.3.1.2-2.
When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 7.3.1.2-3 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 8.7.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
As stated in TS 36.851, the focus of current TDD inter-band CA is not
supporting simultaneous Tx/Rx. Comparing to the 1UL/2DL architecture an
additional diplexer may be used for the Tx chain, while the Rx chain could be
reused. It is therefore proposed to define the following ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c
values for CA_39A-41A with two uplinks in Table 8.7.4-1 and Table 8.7.4-2,
note that different ΔTIB,c value is used for one uplink and two uplinks:

### 9.1.2 IMD analysis for CA class A4 band combinations
When UE with interband CA capability transmits on both uplink bands
simultaneously, intermodulation components and harmonics of the wanted signal
are generated. In some cases these unwanted components may interfere own
reception on either of own E-UTRA downlinks, ISM and/or GNSS frequencies. Also
interband CA band combinations currently specified in releases 10-11 for
single uplink operation were analysed, even if simultaneous transmission of
both uplinks have not been planned on those yet.
The ranges of intermodulation components were calculated for intermodulation
components up to fifth order and conflicts with own downlinks, ISM and GNSS
frequencies were reported. The frequency bands reserved for ISM and GNSS
operation are presented in table 5.2.1-2.
In this analysis the protection of the entire GNSS bands is considered.
However, in reality the actual wanted signals are narrower than that.
Therefore if it is decided that GNSS bands need to be protected, practical
signal bandwidths and center frequencies should be used instead covering the
entire bands.
It should always be noted that the regions where each band is deployed has not
been taken into account in this analysis.
The following table can be updated according to the deployment of individual
band.
Table 9.1-1: Results of the IMD study showing the components falling on own
Rx, ISM and GNSS frequencies. Band configurations belonging to interband class
A4 are bolded.

Based on Table 9.2.1.2-1 2^nd^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 5. In
addition to this 5^th^ order IMD may fall into band 5 Rx also, which is seen
in Table 9.2.1.2-2 and may have to be considered in Rx desensitization
studies. 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order IMD and harmonics may also fall into Rx
frequencies of bands 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 19, 22, 26, 27, 38, 41 and 42.
In addition to E-UTRA bands also co-existence with GNSS and ISM frequencies
was studied. GNSS and ISM frequencies which were included in the study are
captured in Table 9.2.1.2-3.

Based on table 9.8.1.1-2, 2nd harmonic and 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may fall

was studied. GNSS and ISM frequencies which were included in the study are
captured in Table 9.8.1.1-3.

It can be seen that when IM4 and IM5 products are considered, there is
potential for overlap with the receive band of both Band 3 and Band 8.
Therefore, this combination has attributes of both class A2 (harmonics) and A4
(intermods). However, it was found that the impact of 2nd harmonic
interference is limited and in fact, the specifications for this band
combination in 1UL/2DL configuration do not provide any relaxation for the
insertion loss needed if the harmonic were to be filtered and do not have a
reference sensitivity requirement in the case that there is overlap due to the
rarity of occurrence. We propose in defining this CA configuration to include
both aspects of harmonic interference (A2) and intermodulation inteference
(A4). It is expected that the harmonic interference aspects will be treated as
they were for 1UL; that is, the reference sensitivity specifications will only
be defined for frequencies where there is no harmonic overlap. The
intermodulation interference aspects will be treated with MSD as agreed for A4
combinations.
##### 9.8.1.2.1 Impacted frequency ranges
Upon closer inspection, it is observed that not all of the channels within
Band 3 and Band 8 generate IM4 and IM5 self-interference. The analysis above
is general, based only on the band definition. In many cases, while the 2UL
channel pairing is indeed within Band 3 and Band 8, the IM5 product does not
fall on the downlink.
1) The downlink frequency allocation owned by the operator is within the band,
but is outside if the range where IM products land,
2) The uplink frequency allocation owned by the operator is within the band,
but is outside of the range where IM products generated land within the
receive band,
3) The IM products might land within the downlink band or even within the
frequency allocation owned by the operator, but the IM products do not land in
receive channels when taking into account the Tx-Rx spacing of the band and
the symmetric uplink and downlink channel bandwidth,
4) The IM products might land within the downlink band, downlink frequency
allocation, and downlink channel, but only for specific uplink channel
pairings. Since IM products depend on the location of _both_ uplink channels,
the operator may not have the specific pairing in both bands to cause a
problem.
Thus, while the general approach based on band definition to determine IM
frequency range identifies _potential_ impact, whether there is _actual_
impact depends on a number of other parameters and can be avoided in many
cases. For the purpose of classifying band combinations and defining
specifications for standardization, we believe that the general approach is
most suitable since the specifications are not defined for any particular
operator holdings and deployment. However, it is noted that operator-specific
holdings and deployments may not suffer from IM self-interference, even if the
CA configuration it falls under is classified as A4.
##### 9.8.1.2.1 Example
Consider an operator who owns spectrum in Band 3 and Band 8 and desires to
deploy 2UL/2DL CA. The operator spectrum allocation in this example is 1735 -
1755 / 1830 - 1850 MHz in Band 3 and 905 - 915 / 950 - 960 MHz in Band 8. The
harmonic and intermod analysis for this example is shown in table 9.8.1.2.1-1
Table 9.8.1.2.1-1: The harmonic and intermod analysis for band 3 and band 8
{width="3.123611111111111in" height="3.592361111111111in"}
It can be seen that there is no IM4 interference and no IM5 interference to
Band 8 since the operator allocation in the downlink is outside of the range
where IM products land (the 960 MHz edge of Band 8 downlink is on the border
if it is found that IM4 is problematic). For Band 3 downlink, the
intermodulation products formed when considering the uplink allocation of the
operator in this example do land in-band in the range 1865 - 1880 MHz.
However, because of the Tx-Rx separation in Band 3, the receive channel in the
downlink of Band 8 is 1830 - 1850 MHz. Therefore, the IM5 interference does
not land in the receive channel.
It is therefore shown that although the 2UL CA_3-8 combination is classified
as A4 due to the potential for IM4 and IM5 self-interference, in this
particular example, the interference is not present. It is therefore expected
that in this example, the receive performance will not be subjected to the
maximum sensitivity degradation due to IM interference.
