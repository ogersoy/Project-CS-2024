# 4 Background
Chinese government officially announced to allocate 1880-1920 MHz to IMT TDD
in 2002. Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of the
Government of the People\'s Republic of China formally issued 4G (TD-LTE)
commercial licences on December 4, 2013. Band 39 is one of the main commercial
4G (TD-LTE) frequencies. Operator has big interest to deploy carrier
aggregation network in Band 39.
## 4.1 Task description
The objectives of this work item are as follows:
● Specify the specific RF requirements for band 39 intra-band contiguous CA
scenario
● Define the supported transmission bandwidths for this band combination.
Currently, 20MHz channel bandwidth is used in the commercial TD-LTE network in
China. In addition, 5MHz, 10MHz and 15MHz may also be used for Band 39 in the
near future when more frequencies are available.
● Add the performance requirements for this band combination in the relevant
specifications.
This WI is seen as complementary to the generic one (Carrier Aggregation for
LTE) where band combination independent tasks are treated.
## 4.2 Spectrum and regulatory review
### 4.2.1 Spectrum and regulatory review in China
In 2002, Ministry of Information Industry of the People\'s Republic of China
(MII) officially announced that 1920-1980/2110-2170MHz, 1880-1920MHz and
1755-1785/1850-1880MHz was allocated to IMT-2000 systems.
In 2012, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People\'s
Republic of China (MIIT) announced that frequency arrangements for IMT-2000
were changed to apply for IMT (including both IMT-2000 and IMT-Advanced).
Operators can upgrade their network technologies in the existing operating
frequencies with the permission of MIIT.

Figure 4.2.1-1 Spectrum allocation around 1.9GHz in China
The spectrum allocation around 1.9GHz in China is illustrated in figure 4.2-1.
According to the frequency allocation, band 39 is in the middle of band 3
downlink and band 1 uplink. To avoid the FDD and TDD coexistence interference
in adjacent frequencies, in November 2012, MIIT issued a notice of radio
frequency and station set up requirements for IMT base station operating in
1800 and 1900MHz bands. The minimum coupling loss (MCL) between IMT FDD and
TDD base station is at least 50dB. The detail regulatory unwanted emission and
blocking requirements for base stations working on 1.8GHz and 1.9GHz bands are
specified in table 4.2.1-1 and table 4.2.1-2. There are no regulatory UE-UE
coexistence requirements.

The mechanism to meet the emission level specified in Table 6.1.5-1 is to
define CA_NS signalling and the corresponding A-MPR table.
**[Network signalled value \"CA_NS_07\"]{.underline}**
When \"CA_NS_07\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission shall
not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.1.5-2. This requirement also
applies for the frequency ranges that are less than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table
6.6.3.1A-1 in TS36.101 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth.

### 6.1.6 A-MPR
If the UE is configured to CA_39C and it receives IE CA_NS_07 the allowed
maximum output power reduction applied to transmission on the PCC and the SCC
for contiguously aggregated signals is specified in Table 6.1.6-1.

If the UE is configured to CA_39C and it receives IE CA_NS_07 the allowed
maximum output power reduction applied to transmissions on the PCell and the
SCell with non-contiguous resource allocation is defined as follows
A-MPR = CEIL {M~A,~ 0.5}
Where M~A~ is defined as follows
> M~A~ = -16.67A + 17.50 ; 0 ≤ A \
> -9.00 A + 15.20 ; 0.30 ≤ A \
> -2.50 A + 10.00 ; 0.80 ≤ A ≤ 1
Where A = N~RB_alloc~ / N~RB_agg~
## 6.2 Receiver characteristics
Three subclauses in TS 36.101 (Rel-11) shall be updated for UE supporting
intra-band contiguous CA in Band 39, and these subclauses cover the following
aspects:
Reference sensitivity
In-band blocking
Out-of-band blocking
Because CA Band 39 is TDD band, there is no restriction on the uplink RB
allocations when defining the UE receiver characteristics, and the uplink
configuration shall be specified with full RB allocation for both PCC and SCC
for all supported CC combinations. All of the relative changes for CA in Band
39 are captured in sub-clause 9.1 in the present document.
# 7 E-UTRA RRM requirements for UE
There are no additional measurement procedures or performance requirements
specifically for CA in Band 39.
# 8 E-UTRA RF requirements for BS
A study of the existing technical specifications, including MSR, was
conducted. The study concluded that no impact to BS RF specifications is
required. Support for Band 39 CA in the BS specifications can be accommodated
solely by a new entry for CA_39 in Table 5.5-2 in TS 36.104 and a new entry
for CA_39 in Table 5.5-2 in TS 36.141. These changes are identified in Section
9.2 and 9.4.
# 9 Summary of required changes to E-UTRA specifications
