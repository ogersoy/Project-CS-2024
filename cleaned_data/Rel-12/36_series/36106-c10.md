## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Carrier: The modulated waveform conveying the E-UTRA or UTRA physical
channels**
**Channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier
with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a
cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for
transmitter and receiver RF requirements.
**Channel edge:** The lowest and highest frequency of the E-UTRA carrier,
separated by the channel bandwidth.
**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and the
donor base station.
**Downlink** : Signal path where base station transmits and mobile receives.
**Downlink operating band:** The part of the operating band designated for
downlink.
**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.
**Operating band:** A frequency range in which E-UTRA operates (paired or
unpaired), that is defined with a specific set of technical requirements**.**
NOTE1: The operating band(s) for an E-UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 5.5 table 5.5-1.
NOTE2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating band
and downlink operating band.
**Output power, Pout:** This is the mean power of one carrier at maximum
repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load
impedance of the transmitter.
**Pass band:** The frequency range in which the repeater operates in with
operational configuration. This frequency range can correspond to one or
several consecutive nominal channels. If they are not consecutive each subset
of channels shall be considered as an individual pass band. A repeater can

level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the
antenna connector.
**Repeater:** A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or
conducted RF carrier both in the downlink direction (from the base station to
the mobile area) and in the uplink direction (from the mobile to the base
station) ~~In operating bands with one exclusive link direction, only the
dedicated link direction is repeated.~~
In operating bands specified with only down-link or up-link, only the up-link
or down-link as specified for the operating band is repeated.

## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 36.143 [4] Annex B defines
Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each
test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [3].
## 4.2 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.2-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.

## 5.7 Channel arrangement
### 5.7.1 Channel spacing
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.7.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.
### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 - 65535\. The
relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is
given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

NOTE: The channel numbers that designate carrier frequencies so close to the
operating band edges that the carrier extends beyond the operating band edge
shall not be used. This implies that the first 7, 15, 25, 50, 75 and 100
channel numbers at the lower operating band edge and the last 6, 14, 24, 49,
74 and 99 channel numbers at the upper operating band edge shall not be used
for channel bandwidths of 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz respectively.

# 6 Output power
Output power, Pout, of the repeater is the mean power of one carrier at
maximum repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal
load impedance of the transmitter.
Maximum output power, Pmax, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference condition.
## 6.1 Minimum requirement
The requirements shall apply at maximum gain, with E-UTRA signals in the pass
band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated output power
per channel.
When the power of all signals is increased by 10 dB, compared to the power
level that produce the maximum rated output power, the requirements shall
still be met.
In normal conditions, the Repeater maximum output power shall remain within
limits specified in Table 6.1-1 relative to the manufacturer\'s rated output
power.

### 9.2.3 Co-location with base stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850 UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are
co-located with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
transmitter and receiver.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with Wide Area UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
#### 9.2.3.1 Minimum Requirements
Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of
the repeater, at maximum gain.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in Table 9.2.3.1-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency
range immediately outside the repeaters operating band frequency range of an
operating band (see Table 5.5-1). This is also the case when the repeaters
operating band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of the co-
location requirement in the Table 9.2.3.1-1. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss.
However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [5].
NOTE 2: The Table 9.2.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.3.1-1 for the up link
direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of
the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB between a
Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.
NOTE 4: The requirements of -83dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.3.1-1 for the up link
direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of
the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 43 dB between a
Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.
NOTE 5: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz and -83dBm/100kHz in Table
9.2.3.1-1shall be reconsidered when the state of the art technology
progresses.
# 10 Error Vector Magnitude
## 10.1 Downlink Error Vector Magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the ideal
symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization. This difference is
called the error vector. The equaliser parameters are estimated as defined in
TS36.104 [6] Annex E. The EVM result is defined as the square root of the
ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed in
percent.
### 10.1.1 Minimum requirement
For all E-UTRA channel bandwidths, as defined in sub-clause 5.6, applicable to
the repeater, the EVM measurement shall be performed over all allocated
resource blocks and subframes within a frame. The EVM value is then calculated
as the mean square root of the measured values.
For the downlink of the repeater the Error Vector Magnitude shall not be worse
than 8 %.
## 10.2 Uplink Error Vector Magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by
the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the IQ origin offset
shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and
absolute amplitude of the Tx chain. The EVM result is defined after the front-
end IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %. The basic EVM measurement interval is
one slot in the time domain.
### 10.2.1 Minimum requirement
For the uplink of the repeater the RMS average of the basic EVM measurements
for 10 consecutive sub-frames for the different modulations schemes shall not
exceed 8 %.
# 11 Input Intermodulation
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.
## 11.1 General requirement
The following requirement applies for interfering signals in the operating
bands defined in sub-clause 5.5, depending on the repeaters pass band.
This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater, at
maximum gain.
### 11.1.1 Minimum requirement
For the parameters specified in table 11.1.1-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the 3^rd^ order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre of
the pass band.
Table 11.1.1-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals, where:
> \- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first or
> last channel in the pass band of the closer carrier.
Table 11.1.1-1: Input intermodulation requirement
* * *
f~1~ offset Interfering Signal Levels Type of signals Measurement bandwidth
1,0 MHz -40 dBm 2 CW carriers 1 MHz
* * *
## 11.2 Co-location with BS in other systems
This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of E-UTRA FDD Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850,
UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located with an E-UTRA FDD
Repeater.
Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of
the repeater, at maximum gain.
### 11.2.1 Minimum requirement
For the parameters specified in table 11.2.1-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre
of the pass band.
NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation products correspond to the 4^th^ and 3^rd^
order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 11.2.1-1 do not apply when the
repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of the
co-location requirement in the Table 11.2.1-1. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss.
However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [5].
NOTE 2: The Table 11.2.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.
## 11.3 Co-existence with other systems
This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied when GSM900,
DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS operating in
another frequency band co-exist with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.
Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of
the repeater, at maximum gain.
### 11.3.1 Minimum requirement
For the parameters specified in table 11.3.1-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre
of the pass band.
NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation products correspond to the 4^th^ and 3^rd^
order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 11.3.1-1 do not apply when the
repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of the
co-existence requirement in the Table 11.3.1-1. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-existence.
NOTE 2: The Table 11.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
# 12 Output intermodulation
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products signals created
by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the repeater via the output
port.
The requirement shall apply to the downlink of the Repeater.
## 12.1 Minimum requirement
The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation products
when an interfering signal is injected into the output port. The wanted signal
channel bandwidth BW~Channel~ shall be the maximum bandwidth supported by the
repeater. The offset of the interfering signal from the wanted signal shall be
as in Table 12.1‑1.
Table 12.1-1 Interfering and wanted signals for the output intermodulation
requirement
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Value | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Wanted signal | E-UTRA signal of maximum channel | | | bandwidth BW~Channel~ | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal type | E-UTRA signal of channel | | | bandwidth 5 MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal level | Mean power level 30 dB below the | | | mean power of the wanted signal | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Interfering signal centre | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 12.5 MHz | | frequency offset from wanted | | | signal carrier centre frequency | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 7.5 MHz | | | | | | -BW~Channel~ /2 - 2.5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 2.5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 7.5 MHz | | | | | | BW~Channel~ /2 + 12.5 MHz | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE: Interfering signal | | | positions that are partially or | | | completely outside of the | | | downlink operating band of the | | | repeater are excluded from the | | | requirement. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
The output intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission limits
in clause 9 in the presence of an interfering signal according to Table
12.1‑1. The measurement may be limited to frequencies on which third and fifth
order intermodulation products appear, considering the width of these
products.
# 13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
## 13.1 Definitions and applicability
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted gain
per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the
repeater on an adjacent channel outside the repeater pass band. The carrier in
the pass band and in the adjacent channel shall be of the same type (reference
carrier).
The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater, at
maximum gain, where the donor link is maintained via antennas (over the air
Repeater).
### 13.1.1 Minimum Requirements
There is no minimum requirement for E-UTRA signals.
## 13.2 Co-existence with UTRA
This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA signals in
geographic areas in which E-UTRA-FDD Repeater and UTRA BS are deployed so that
they serve adjacent channels. The reference carrier is a UTRA-FDD carrier.
### 13.2.1. Minimum Requirements
In normal conditions the ACRR shall be higher than the value specified in the
Table 13.2.1-1.
Table 13.2.1-1: Repeater ACRR
* * *
Co-existence with other systems Repeater maximum output power Channel offset
from the centre frequency of the first or last 5MHz channel within the pass
band. ACRR limit UTRA P ≥ 31 dBm 5 MHz 33dB P ≥ 31 dBm 10 MHz 33dB P \< 31 dBm
5 MHz 20dB P \< 31 dBm 10 MHz 20dB
* * *
Note1: Repeater maximum output power as defined in TS25.143 clause 9.1.1.
Note2: For co-existence with TDD, a narrow band requirement is for further
study.
###### ## Annex A (normative): Environmental requirements for the Repeater
equipment
The Repeater equipment shall fulfil all the requirements in the full range of
environmental conditions for the relevant environmental class from the
relevant IEC specifications listed below
60 721-3-3 \"Stationary use at weather protected locations\" [7];
60 721-3-4 \"Stationary use at non weather protected locations\" [8].
Normally it is sufficient for all tests to be conducted using normal test
conditions except where otherwise stated. For guidance on the use of test
conditions to be used in order to show compliance refer to TS 36.143.
