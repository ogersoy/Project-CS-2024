# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
RAN4 framework requirements for non-contiguous intra-band CA with 1 UL are
defined in Release 11 under the LTE CA enhancement WID. The framework
requirements for non-contiguous intra-band CA with 2ULs have been postponed to
release 12. RAN4 framework requirements are utilized when developing different
band specific requirements based on the work done for the framework
requirements. After deploying 2 DL CA with 1 UL on the field CA deployments
are expected to move towards 2UL deployments
## 4.2 Work item objective
The objectives of this work item are:
\- Specify the band specific RF requirements for band 4 intra-band non-
contiguous carrier aggregation for 2UL.
\- Same channel bandwidth combinations as in the LTE_CA_NC_B4 apply.
\- Add the performance requirements for this band combination in the relevant
specifications.
\- Add the conformance testing in RAN5 specifications (to follow).
This WI is seen as complementary to the LTE Carrier Aggregation Enhancements
work item, where generic aspects for non-contiguous carrier aggregation are
treated.
