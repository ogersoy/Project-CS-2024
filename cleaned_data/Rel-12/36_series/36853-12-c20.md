# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 3DL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-12 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
present document is divided in two different parts:
\- Common part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination).
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.

rapporteur of each WI to ensure that the TPs related to the WI have been
implemented.
# 5 3 Band Carrier Aggregation with single UL: general part
BS, UE, and RF general requirements are specified in the individual band
combinations in clause 6.
## 5.1 RF receiver characteristics
### 5.1.1 UL configuration for verifying RF receiver characteristics
In what follows we describe the test configuration for verifying RF receiver
requirements for inter-band CA and combinations of inter-band and intra-band
CA for 3DL FDD. The description is general, but with some specific CA
configurations used as examples.
The number of possible DL-UL configurations will increase substantially for
3DL aggregation compared to the 2DL counterpart for which two configurations
is specified: one for each uplink band. Despite the large number of possible
DL-UL configurations for 3DL aggregation, requirements should still be
specified for all DL-UL configurations in order to make the test coverage
complete, whereas for the conformance test specification, a subset of these
configurations could be chosen for the verification in order to reduce the
test time.
Starting with band combinations with one DL carrier per operating band, e.g.
CA_4A-12A-30A, it is straightforward to specify the requirements relying on
the test configuration for 2DL inter-band combinations. For the latter, the
reference sensitivity is essentially verified in the following way:
1) pick one of the carriers as the \"measurement carrier\" but keep the
carrier in the other downlink band active;
2) assign the uplink in any one of the two uplink bands;
3) make the measurement.
Then this is repeated with the roles of the two DL carriers/bands
interchanged. The selectivity and blocking requirements for 2DL combinations
are verified in the following way:
1) pick one of the carriers as the \"measurement carrier\" but keep the
carrier in the other downlink band active;
2) assign the uplink in the other band not supporting the measured carrier;
3) make the measurement with the interferers assigned relative to the measured
carrier.
Thus the verification of the requirement is "per carrier". The selectivity and
blocking tests does not include the effect of the UL in the band supporting
the measured DL, but rather effects of e.g. cross-modulation arising from the
UL in the other band not captured in the corresponding tests for non-CA
operation.
This could be extended for 3DL combinations of different bands with one DL
carrier per operating band such as the configuration CA_4A-12A-30A:
a) pick one of the carriers as the "measurement carrier" but keep the carriers
in the other downlink bands active;
b) assign the uplink in any one of the three uplink bands (reference
sensitivity) or assign the uplink in one of the other bands not supporting the
measured carrier (blocking and selectivity);
c) make the measurement; for the selectivity and blocking tests, the
interferers are assigned relative to the measured carrier.
Then repeat for all three DL carriers and the applicable uplink
configurations.
The downside is that the number of measurements would be large and the test
time considerable. For 2DL aggregation, there are two possible measurements:
one for each DL carrier with the UL in the other band. For 3DL aggregation,
there are six possible measurements for each blocking and selectivity test
case: for each measured DL carrier the UL can be assigned to anyone of the
other two operating bands -- nine measurements for reference sensitivity.
Nevertheless, the core requirements in TS 36.101 [5] should cover all cases;
the procedure a-c) would be viable for this purpose, but the measurements need
to be limited for the conformance tests in TS 36.521-1 [5].
Turning next to combinations of non-contiguous intra-band and inter-band CA
such as CA_2A-2A-13A, the following modification of a-c) for blocking and
selectivity based on the test approaches for the 2DL intra-band non-contiguous
and inter-band cases:
a) pick one of the carriers as the \"measurement carrier\", keep all other
downlink carriers active;
b) assign the uplink in the band not supporting the measured carrier: if the
measurement carrier is within the band containing two carriers (Band 2),
assign the uplink in the band not supporting the single carrier (Band 13) with
UL configuration according to the non-CA case, whereas if the measurement
carrier is within the band supporting one carrier, assign the uplink in
accordance with the test configuration for the corresponding intra-band
REFSENS test for 2DL non-contiguous aggregation (CA_2A-2A);
c) make the measurement with the interferer(s) assigned relative to the
measured carrier.
Hence the selectivity and blocking tests does not include the effect of the UL
in the band supporting the measured DL(s) just as for the 2DL inter-band
tests.
For the reference sensitivity test, the UL should be assigned in any one of
the two bands, but always with the configuration according to the
corresponding test for 2DL non-contiguous aggregation when the UL is active in
this band. Again, the number of measurements would be large and the test time
considerable, but all six cases (still two possible UL configurations for each
measured DL carrier) should nevertheless be covered by the core requirements.
The UL configuration for the two cases above is displayed in Figure 5.1.1-1.
In the case of one DL per band, the UL is assigned at F~UL1~ or F~UL2~ for
measurements on F~DL3~ for blocking and selectivity tests, whereas any one of
the three UL frequencies is used for the reference sensitivity. In the mixed
case in the lower part of Figure 5.1.1-1, the UL is assigned at F~UL1~ for
measurements on F~DL2~ and F~DL3~ for the blocking and selectivity tests,
whereas either F~UL1~ or F~UL3~ is used for the reference sensitivity test
(F~UL2~ is never used).

Figure 5.1.1-1: UL configuration for 3DL receiver tests
Hence the tests configuration for 3DL is consistent with that for the 2DL
fall-back modes. For the intermodulation tests, the same procedure for
blocking and selectivity is used.
### 5.1.2 Requirements for reference sensitivity
Starting with band combinations with one DL carrier per operating band, the
reference sensitivity for 2DL inter-band CA can be extended to 3DL using the
procedure a-c) in 5.2.2.1; the requirements for inter-band CA with one
component carrier per band would read as follows; changes of the Rel-11
version of TS 36.101 shown in italics:
**\  For inter-band carrier aggregation with _one component carrier per operating
> band and the_ uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the throughput shall be â‰¥
> 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
> specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
> Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
> A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.3.1-1 and Table
> 7.3.1-2. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with _all_ downlink
> component carriers active and _any one_ of the uplink carriers active. The
> UE shall meet the requirements specified in subclause 7.3.1 with the
> following exceptions.
The non-CA requirements apply per component carrier (two or three in the
Rel-12 version of 36.101).
For 3DL combinations with harmonics problems between any two (or three) bands
of a configuration, exceptions are allowed whenever any transmitter harmonics
uplink transmission in a "lower" band falls into a higher band. Picking
CA_4A-12A-30A as an example, the exceptions to B4 requirements would be
allowed when the uplink is assigned in B12 just as for the 2DL fall-back mode
CA_4A-12A that is of Class A2. (The other fall-back modes CA_12A_30A and
CA_4A_30A are of Class A1 and Class A3, respectively.) However, the exceptions
for B4 allowed for CA_4A-12A-30A may not be the same as those allowed for
CA_4A-12A due to different front-end arrangements: a B4-B30 multiplexer is
needed for the former. The changes of the 36.101 could look as follows
(changes in italics), using the existing table for A2 combinations specified
in Rel-11:
For the UE that supports any of the E-UTRA CA configurations given in Table
7.3.1A-0a, exceptions are allowed when the uplink is active in a lower-
frequency band and within a specified frequency range such that transmitter
harmonics fall within the downlink transmission bandwidth assigned in a higher
band as noted in Table 7.3.1A-0a. For these exceptions, the UE shall meet the
requirements specified in Table 7.3.1A-0a, Table 7.3.1A-0b and Table
7.3.1A-0c.

For combinations of non-contiguous intra-band and inter-band aggregation such
as CA_2A-2A-13A, the reference sensitivity requirements should build on the
requirements for the fall-back modes CA_2A-13A for and CA_2A-2A (to be
specified in Rel-12), using the configuration in 5.2.2.1:
â€¢ for the component carrier in B13, the UE shall meet the requirement for B13
when the UL is allocated either in B2 according to the configuration in Table
7.3.1A-3 in 36.101 for intra-band NC CA or in B13;
â€¢ for the component carriers in B2, the UE shall meet the requirements for B2
intra-band NC CA when the UL is allocated in B2 according to the configuration
in Table 7.3.1A-3 in 36.101, while the same requirement should be met but with
âˆ†R~IBNC~ = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps when the UL is active in B13.
The carriers are measured in turn with the remaining component carriers active
throughout the test. The âˆ†R~IBNC~ specified in Table 7.3.1A-3 for CA_2A-2A (to
be specified) should also apply for CA_2A-2A-13A,
Table 7.3.1A-3: Intra-band non-contiguous CA uplink configuration for
reference sensitivity

band combinations.
Reference-sensitivity requirements for combinations of intra-band non-
contiguous and intra-band CA could be added to 36.101 as follows, for example:
> _For combinations of intra-band non-contiguous and inter-band carrier
> aggregation with three downlink carriers and one uplink carrier assigned to
> one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with an uplink configuration in
> accordance with Table 7.3.1A-3 when the uplink is active in the band
> supporting two component carriers and in accordance with Table 7.3.1-2 when
> the uplink is active in the other band. For these uplink configurations, the
> UE shall meet the reference sensitivity requirements for intra-band non-
> contiguous carrier aggregation of two downlink carriers and for the
> remaining component carrier the requirements specified in subclause 7.3.1.
> For the two component carriers within the same band, âˆ†R~IBNC~ = 0 dB for all
> sub-block gaps (Table 7.3.1A-3) when the uplink is active in the band
> supporting the single component carrier._

### 5.1.3 Requirements for blocking and selectivity
Even if all possible DL-UL combinations for blocking and selectivity are
specified in the core specification, many of test configurations (for the UL)
or even some test cases could possibly be omitted in the conformance test
specification given the number of permutations. One could then rely on the
conformance tests for 2DL. However, the out-of-band blocking should be
verified for conformance with all component carriers active.
For band combinations with one DL carrier per operating band, the out-of-band
blocking requirements for 2DL inter-band CA can be extended to 3DL using the
procedure a-c) in 5.2.2.1. The requirements then apply per carrier with the
blocker frequency offset relative to the measured carrier and the UL allocated
in one of bands not containing the measured carrier. Table 7.6.2.1A-0 in
36.101 specifying the interferer power profile would have to be amended to
cover three downlink carriers in different bands:
**\  _For combinations of intra-band non-contiguous and inter-band carrier
> aggregation with three downlink carriers and the uplink assigned to one
> E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active in the band
> other than that supporting the downlink(s) under test. The uplink
> configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.1A-3 when the uplink is
> active in the band supporting two component carriers and in accordance with
> Table 7.3.1-2 when the uplink is active in the other band. For the two
> component carriers within the same band, P~wanted~ in Table 7.6.2.1A-0 is
> set using âˆ†R~IBNC~ = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps (Table 7.3.1A-3). For each
> downlink the UE shall meet the out-of-band blocking requirements applicable
> for inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating
> band. The three downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests._
For 3DL CA configurations, the number of allowed exceptions per downlink
carrier should be the same as that for 2DL CA configurations:
> _For Table 7.6.2.1A-0 in frequency ranges 1, 2 and 3, up to_
> {width="1.1625in" height="0.19375in"} _exceptions per downlink are allowed
> for spurious response frequencies when measured using a step size of 1 MHz.
> For these exceptions the requirements in clause 7.7.1A apply._
Turning to in-band blocking and combinations with one component carrier per
band, the requirements for 2DL combinations could be extended to 3DL using the
procedure a-c) in 5.2.2.1 (the UL in any band not containing the measured
carrier):
7.6.1.1A Minimum requirements for CA
> For inter-band carrier aggregation with _one component carrier per operating
> band and the_ uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the in-band blocking
> requirements are defined with the uplink active on the _band(s)_ other than
> the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements
> specified in subclause 7.6.1.1 for each component carrier while _all_
> downlink carriers are active. For the UE which supports inter band CA
> configuration in Table 7.3.1A-2, P~Interferer~ power defined in Table
> 7.6.1.1-2 is increased by the amount given by Î”R~IB,c~ in Table 7.3.1A-2.
> For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band without uplink band
> (as noted in Table 5.5-1), the requirements for _all_ downlinks shall be met
> with the uplink in the _band(s)_ capable of UL operation [...]
For combinations of intra-band non-contiguous and inter-band CA, the in-band
blocking requirements could be amended in the following way, for example:
> _For combinations of intra-band non-contiguous and inter-band carrier
> aggregation with three downlink carriers and one uplink carrier assigned to
> one E-UTRA band, the requirement is defined with the uplink active in the
> band other than that supporting the downlink(s) under test. The uplink
> configuration shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.1A-3 when the uplink is
> active in the band supporting two component carriers and in accordance with
> Table 7.3.1-2 when the uplink is active in the other band. For these uplink
> configurations, the UE shall meet the in-band blocking requirements for
> intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation of two downlink carriers with
> âˆ†R~IBNC~ = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps (Table 7.3.1A-3) and for the
> remaining component carrier the requirements specified in subclause 7.6.1.
> The three downlink carriers shall be active throughout the tests._
Remark that the requirements for the two component carriers in the same band
must be met with âˆ†R~IBNC~ = 0 dB for all sub-block gaps since the UL is active
in the other band.
Adjacent channel selectivity could be verified in the same way as for in-band
blocking.
**End of extract from TS 36.101 >**
### 5.1.4 Requirements for wideband intermodulation
The requirements for wideband intermodulation could be verified like for in-
band blocking as described in 5.2.2.3.
### 5.1.5 Requirements for maximum input level
For combinations of intra-band non-contiguous and inter-band CA, the maximum
input level could be specified in the following way using the principle a-c)
in 5.2.2.1, e.g. for CA_2A-2A-13A:
â€¢ the UE shall meet the maximum input-level requirements applicable for intra-
band non-contiguous carrier aggregation of two downlink carriers in B2 with
the uplink active in B13: the sum of the mean carrier powers received at the
UE antenna port should be -22 dBm while both B2 carriers have equal power; the
B13 downlink is also active (but not necessarily at maximum input power);
â€¢ the UE shall meet the maximum input-level requirement for B13 (-25 dBm) with
the uplink active in B2 (according to Table 7.3.1A-3); the B2 downlinks are
also active (but not necessarily at maximum input power).
## 5.2 Specific BS RF requirements
It is agreed that:
1) Table 5.2-3 Inter-band carrier aggregation bands (two bands) in TS 36.104
and TS 36.141 can be reused to list the Inter-band CA + Intra-band contiguous
CA supported in the specifications.
**\ **
2) Table 5.5-3 Inter-band carrier aggregation bands (two bands) in TS 36.104
and TS 36.141 can be reused to list the Inter-band CA + Intra-band non-
contiguous CA supported in the specifications, with the new CA_X-Y-Y insert
into the middle of the table.
**\ **
3) A new Table 5.2-3A Inter-band carrier aggregation bands (three bands) shall
be introduced in TS 36.104 and TS 36.141 to list the Inter-band CA supported
in the specifications.

### 6.1.1 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/3 DL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
2 and Band 13 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.1.1-1 below:
Table 6.1.1-1: Band 2, Band 2 and Band 13 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1-low f1-high f2-low f2-high f3-low f3-high DL frequency (MHz)

f3-low)

3^rd^ order IMD products (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) (f2-high + f3-high --

3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f2-low + f3-low) (f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 4606 4736
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.1.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 2 + 13) may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28 and 44. However, Bands
18, 27, 28 and 44 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as
Bands 2 and 13. Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products
falling into Bands 12, 13, 14, 17 and 26.
Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS own (10 MHz)
receive block within Band 13. Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the
Band (2 + 2 + 13) BS are _a_ , _b_ and _c_ MHz in channel bandwidth and _d_ ,
_e_ and _f_ MHz from the lower edges of Bands 2 and 13 DL frequency bands as
shown in Figure 6.1.1-1 below:
Figure 6.1.1-1: 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (2 + 2 + 13) BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.1.1-2 below:

Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.1.1-2 below:

Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.1.1-2 with the BS receive blocks
in Figure 6.1.1-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused
in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the BS own receive
block of Band 13 under one of the transmit configurations shown in Table

### 6.13.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.13.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
3 and Band 8 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.13.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.13.3.1-1: Band 1, Band 3 and Band 8 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *

f3-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 560 730
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high) (f1-high + f3-high --
f2-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2955 3125
3^rd^ order IMD products (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) (f2-high + f3-high --
f1-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 1155 1325
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f2-low + f3-low) (f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 4840 5010
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.13.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 3 + 8) may fall into
BS receive band of Bands 12, 17,28 and 44. However, Band 12 and 17 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 1, 3 and 8. Therefore,
the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 28 and
44.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 28 or 44 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 3 + 8) BS transmitter does
not share the same antenna with Band 28 or 44 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (1 + 3 + 8) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 28 or 44 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 28 or 44 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.13.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.13.3.2-1 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B1+ B3 + B8.
It can be seen that distortions caused by 2^nd^ order harmonics of Band 8
located within the pass band of Band 3. It was already identified in previous
work and specified in TR 36.850. Except 2^nd^ order harmonics of Band 8, none
of the products falls into the B1, B3 or B8 UE receiving bands.

It can be seen from Table 6.15.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 4 + 5) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 12, 17, 28 and 44. However, Bands 28 and 44 are
not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 2, 4 and 5.
Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into
Bands 12 and 17.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 12 or 17 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band (2 + 4 + 5) BS transmitter does
not share the same antenna with Band 12 or 17 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (2 + 4 + 5) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 12 or 17 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 12 or 17 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.

It can be seen from Table 6.16.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of

It can be seen from Table 6.17.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 5 + 12) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 2, 3, 9, 10, 25, 35, 42 and 43. However, Bands 3,
9 and 10 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 2, 5
and 12. Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling
into Bands 2, 25, 35, 42 and 43. Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products will
not fall into the BS own (up to 20 MHz) receive block within Band 2.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 42 or 43 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band (2 + 5 + 12) BS transmitter does
not share the same antenna with Band 42 or 43 BS receiver. But there is not a
large frequency gap between Bands 2, 5 and 12 DL and Bands 2, 25 and 35 UL,
and hence Bands 2, 25 and 35 BS receiver desensitization may still be an
issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (2 + 5 + 12) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 2, 25, 35, 42 or 43 BS receiver to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^
order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 2, 25, 35, 42 or

As shown in Table 6.20.3.1-2, second order intermodulation products will not

Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 1-4, 9-10,
23, 25, 30, 33-37 or 39-40. As third intermodulation products may fall to own
receive block of Band 2 or 4 (highlighted in Table 6.20.3.1-2), the
desensitisation may be an issue.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 2, Band 4 and Band 4
should not share the same antenna with Band 1-4, 9-10, 23, 25, 30, 33-37 or

and Band 12
### 6.21.1 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/3 DL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
12 and Band 12 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.21.1-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 3388 3482
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.21.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 12 + 12) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 22, 23, 25, 31, 33, 36, 37, 39 and 42.
However, Bands 1, 31, 33 and 39 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 2 and 12. Moreover, co-location of Band (2 + 12 +
12) transmitter and Band 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-location on
adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain site-engineering
solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus here is on the
3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 22, 23, 25 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 22 or 42 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band (2 + 12 + 12) BS transmitter does
not share the same antenna with Band 22 or 42 BS receiver. But there is not a
large frequency gap between Band 2 DL and Bands 23 and 25 UL, and hence Band
23 or 25 BS receiver desensitization may still be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (2 + 12 + 12) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 22, 23, 25 or 42 BS receiver to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^
order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 22, 23, 25 or 42
BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
### 6.21.2 Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.21.2-1 and 6.21.2-2 respectively.

### 6.21.3 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/2 DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting contiguous or non-contiguous Band 12 DL carriers can be
calculated as shown in Table 6.21.3-1 below:
Table 6.21.3-1: Band 12 DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 729 746

3^rd^ order IMD products (2* f-low -- f-high) (2*f-high -- f-low) IMD
frequency limits (MHz) 712 763
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.21.3-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting
in Band 12 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 21, while the 3^rd^ IMD
products of BS supporting CA of Band 12 may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 12, 17, 28 and 44. Note that the calculation in Table 6.21.3-1 assumes
the BS is transmitting with the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band 12. If the
BS is only transmitting up to 15 MHz (10 + 5 or 5 + 10 MHz) contiguous
carriers in Band 12, then the 3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS
receive band of the Bands 12 and 17 under the transmit configurations shown in
Table 6.21.3-2 below:
Table 6.21.3-2: Band 12 BS contiguous carriers transmit configurations with
3^rd^ IMD within Bands 12 and 17 BS receive band

10 729 -- 730.9 714 -- 715.9 10 5 729 -- 730.9 714 -- 715.9
* * *
The case if the BS is transmitting up to 15 MHz (10 + 5 or 5 + 10 MHz) non-
contiguous carriers in Band 12 is studied as follows. Assume that the 2 non-
contiguous CC transmitted by the Band 12 BS are _a_ and _b_ MHz channel
bandwidth and _c_ and _d_ MHz from the edges of Band 12 DL frequency band as
shown in Figure 6.21.3-1 below:
Figure 6.21.3-1: Non-contiguous CC transmitted by the Band 12 BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.21.3-2 below:
Figure 6.21.3-2: Non-contiguous CC received by the Band 12 BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting the 2 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.21.3-3 below:
Table 6.21.3-3: Band 12 BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
3^rd^ order IMD products IMD frequency limits (MHz) (2*f1-low -- f2-high) 712

f1-low) 746 -- _d_ \-- _a_ \-- _b_ (f2-high + f1-high -- f1-low) 746 -- _d_ \+
_a_
* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.21.3-3 with the BS receive
blocks in Figure 6.21.3-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products
caused in the BS by transmitting the 2 CC will only fall into the BS own
receive blocks of Band 12 under one of the transmit configurations shown in
Table 6.21.3-4 below:

As shown in Table 6.31.3.1-2, second order intermodulation products may fall
to UL frequencies of Band 5-6, 8, 13-14, 18-20, 26-28 or 44.
Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 2, 22, 25,
35, 38-39 or 41-42.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 3, Band 3 and Band 7
should not share the same antenna with Band 2, 5-6, 8, 13-14, 18-20, 22,
25-28, 35, 38-39 or 41-44 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 2,
5-6, 8, 13-14, 18-20, 22, 25-28, 35, 38-39 or 41-44 BS receiver
desensitization.
#### 6.31.3.2 For the UE
For single UL the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for B3 and B7 is done in
the 2DL/1UL TR 36.850. None of the products falls into the B3 or B7 UE
receiving bands. For UE coexistence the single UL is already considered for
these bands in TS 36.101.
### 6.31.4 Î”TIB,c and Î”RIB,c
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with

As shown in Table 6.32.3.1-2, second order intermodulation products may fall
to UL frequencies of Band 5-6, 8, 13-14, 18-20, 26-28 or 44.
Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 2-3, 9-10,
22, 25, 33, 35, 37-39 or 41-42. As third intermodulation products may fall to
own receive block of Band 3 (highlighted in Table 6.32.3.1-2), the
desensitisation may be an issue. It should be noted, third intermodulation
product is falling to UL frequencies of Band 3 when f1 is in the range of
1805-1825MHz. If BS is operating in Band 3 DL frequency of 1805-1825MHz, the
Band 3 UL frequency range is 1710-1730MHz. No issue is foreseen with receiver
desensitisation.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 3, Band 7 and Band 7
should not share the same antenna with Band 2-3, 5-6, 8-10, 13-14, 18-20, 22,
25-28, 33, 35, 37-39 or 41- 44 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band

#### 6.32.3.2 For the UE
For single UL the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for B3 and B7 is done in
the 2DL/1UL TR 36.850. None of the products falls into the B3 or B7 UE

### 6.33.3 Harmonics IMD study
#### 6.33.3.1 For the BS
zzThe 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 4,
Band 4 and Band 5 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.33.3.1-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.33.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (4 + 4 + 5) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26 and 42\. However,
Bands 6, 8, 18, 19 and 20 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Bands 4 and 5. Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD
products falling into Bands 5, 22, 26 and 42.
Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS own (10 MHz)
receive block within Band 5. Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the
Band (4 + 4 + 5) BS are _a_ , _b_ and _c_ MHz in channel bandwidth and _d_ ,
_e_ and _f_ MHz from the lower edges of Bands 4 and 5 DL frequency bands as
shown in Figure 6.33.3.1-1 below:

And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.33.3.1-2
below:
Figure 6.33.3.1-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (4 + 4 + 5) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC

Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.33.3.1-2 with the BS receive
blocks in Figure 6.33.3.1-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD
products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the
BS own receive block of Band 5 under one of the transmit configurations shown
in Table 6.33.3.1-3 below:

As shown in Table 6.36.3.1-2, second order intermodulation products will not
fall to any UL frequencies for Bands specified in 3GPP specifications.
Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 12-14, 17,
22, 28 or 42-44. As third intermodulation products may fall to own receive
block of Band 12 (highlighted in Table 6.36.3.1-2), the desensitisation may be
an issue.
Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (4 + 4 + 12) BS are _a_ ,
_b_ and _c_ MHz in channel bandwidth and _d_ , _e_ and _f_ MHz from the lower
edges of Bands 4 and 12 DL frequency bands as shown in Figure 6.36.3.1-1
below:

And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.36.3.1-2
below:
Figure 6.36.3.1-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (4 + 4 + 12) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.36.3.1-3 below:

As shown in Table 6.44.3.1-2, in addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD
product from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ intermodulation
products generated by BS supporting 3DL CA of Band (4+4+7) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 24, 38 or 41. Since band 7 is not suggested to be
used simultaneously with band 38 or band 41 in the same device, we can safely
assume that there are significant IMD issues for B4+B4 and B7 3DL combination.
#### 6.44.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.44.3.2-1 gives the intermodulation products for band 4+ band 7 CA with

### 6.45.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.45.3.1 For the BS
Table 6.45.3.1-1 gives the three tone IM3 analysis for CA with B4 + B7 + B12.
For two DLs the 2nd and 3rd harmonic analysis for B4 + B7 and B4 + B12 are
done in the 2DL/1UL TR 36.850. None of the products falls into the B4, B7 or
B12 BS receiving bands. We note only single tones for each band are
considered. it is recommended that Bands 4 and 12 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 22, 42 or 43 BS receiver, unless the antenna
path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 22, 42 or 43 BS receiver desensitization.
It can be seen from the tables that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (4 + 7 + 12) may not fall into any of
the BS receive Bands. However, Band 24 is not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 4, 7 and 12. Therefore, the focus here is on the
3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Band 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 42 or 43 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band (4 + 7 + 12) BS transmitter does
not share the same antenna with Band 42 or 43 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (4 + 7 + 12) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 42 or 43 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 43 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.

For single UL the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for B4 + B7 and B4 + B12
is done in the 2DL/1UL TR 36.850. None of the products falls into the B4 or B7
or B12 UE receiving bands. For UE coexistence the single UL is already
considered for these bands in TS 36.101.

As shown in Table 6.46.3.1-2, second order intermodulation products may fall

Third intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 1, 2, 7, 22,
25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38 or 42.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 39, Band 39 and Band 41
should not share the same antenna with Band 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 25,
27, 28, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43 or 44 BS receiver, unless the antenna path
meets very stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Band 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 25, 27, 28, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43

#### 6.46.3.2 For the UE
For single UL non-simultaneous UE, the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for
B39 and B41 is done in the 2DL/1UL TR 36.851. None of the products falls into
the B39 or B41 UE receiving bands. For UE coexistence the single UL is already
considered for these bands in TS 36.101.

### 6.48.2 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/3 DL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
2 and Band 29 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.48.2-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 4577 4708
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.48.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 2 + 29) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 12, 13, 17, 28 and 44. However, Bands 28 and 44
are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 2 and 29.
Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into
Bands 12, 13 and 17.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 13 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (2 + 2 + 29) BS transmitter does not share
the same antenna with Band 13 BS receiver. On the other hand, receiver
desensitization may still be an issue for Bands 12 and 17 BS receive band,
which is only 1 MHz away from Band 29 transmit band.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (2 + 2 + 29) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 12 or 17 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, or with Band 13 BS receiver unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause
Band 13 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed
as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
### 6.48.3 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/2 DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of contiguous Band 2 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.48.3-1 below:
Table 6.48.3-1: Band 2 DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 1930 1990
2^nd^ harmonics frequency limits (MHz) 3860 3980 3^rd^ harmonics frequency
limits (MHz) 5790 5970
2^nd^ order IMD products (f-low -- f-high) (f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) -60 60
3^rd^ order IMD products (2* f-low -- f-high) (2*f-high -- f-low) IMD
frequency limits (MHz) 1870 2050
3^rd^ order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth) (f-low -- f-BWmax)
(f-high + f-BWmax) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 1890 2030
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.48.3-1 that the 3^rd^ IMD products of BS
supporting CA of Band 2 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 23,
25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 39. Note that the calculation in Table 6.48.3-1
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 60 MHz DL
frequency of Band 2. But even if the BS is only transmitting up to 20 MHz (20
+ 20 MHz) contiguous carriers in Band 2 as stated in the WIDS, the 3^rd^ IMD
products may still fall into the BS receive band of these bands as shown in
the last row in Table 6.48.3-1. However, the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall
into the BS own (up to 40 MHz) receive block within Band 2.
Note that Bands 1, 33, 34 and 39 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Band 2. Moreover, co-location of Band 2 transmitter and
Band 35, 36 or 37 transceiver implies FDD/TDD co-location on adjacent
frequencies which requires the use of certain site-engineering solutions to
avoid mutual interference. Consequently, the focus here will be on the 3^rd^
order IMD products falling into Bands 2, 23 and 25.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the Band 2 BS transmit filter and the Band 2, 23 or 25 BS
receive filter would not be able to provide substantial attenuation to reduce
the IMD interference generated within the Band 2, 23 or 25 BS receive band to
well below the receiver noise floor to prevent receiver desensitization, as
there is not a large frequency gap between Band 2 DL and Band 2, 23 or 25 UL.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band 2 BS transmitters supporting contiguous
CA should not share the same antenna with other Band 2, 23 or 25 BS receiver
to prevent BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.

defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [4] when operating in single carrier
mode.
#### 6.49.2.1 List of specific combination issues
For this band combination to work, following need to be 1provided:
1) B1 Rx and B41 Rx need to provide deep rejection at B1 Tx
2) B1 Tx needs deep rejection at B1 Rx and B41 Rx
The current RAN4 requirements for this inter-band CA combination only includes
PCell in FDD band, i.e. band 1.
### 6.49.3 Co-existence studies for Band 1, Band 41 and Band 41
#### 6.49.3.1 For the BS
Table 6.49.3.1-1 gives the intermodulation products for band 1 + band 41+ band
41 CA. For the IMD analysis the maximum transmission as defined in Table
6.49.3.1-1 is considered. None of the harmonics of one band fall into the
receive band of the other. The intermodulation products generated by two
operating bands do not impact the own receiver since TDD BS cannot transmit
and receive simultaneously in a single band.
It can be seen in the table that 2nd order IMD products may fall into BS
receive band 31. The 3rd order IMD products may fall into BS receive bands of
1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 23, 24, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41\. However,
when the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3^rd^ order IMD
products do not fall into the BS receive of Band 1, 23, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37,
39, 40.
It should be noted that Bands 4, 7, 10, 24, 31 and 38 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as Band 1 and Band 41. This leaves bands 3, 9
and 41 to consider for IMD products.
Currently Bands 3 and 9 are used in the same geographical area as Band 1 and
41. It is recommended that Band 1 and 41 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Band 3 or 9 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause
Band 3 or 9 BS receiver desensitization. A TDD BS cannot transmit and receive
simultaneously in a single band so the own B41 receiver is protected. However,
it is not recommended that different band 41 operators share the same antenna
as a Band 1 transmitter unless the operation is synchronized.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [4] when
operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.51.1 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/2 DL
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of contiguous Band 41 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.51.1-1 below:
Table 6.51.1-1: Band 41 DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 2496 2690
2^nd^ harmonics frequency limits (MHz) 4992 5380 3^rd^ harmonics frequency
limits (MHz) 7488 8070
2^nd^ order IMD products (f-low -- f-high) (f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) -194 194
3^rd^ order IMD products (2*f-low -- f-high) (2*f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) 2302 2884
3^rd^ order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth) (f-low -- BWmax)
(f-high + BWmax) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2456 2730
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.51.1-1 that the 3^rd^ order IMD products of BS
transmitting contiguous carriers in Band 41 may fall into the BS receive band
of Bands 7, 30, 38, 40 and 41. Note that the calculation in Table 6.51.1-1
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 194 MHz DL
frequency of Band 41. If the BS is only transmitting an up to 40 MHz DL in
Band 41 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into
the BS receive band of the Band 30 or 40 as shown in the last row in Table
6.51.1-1.
Note that Bands 7 and 38 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Band 41. Moreover, the Band 41 BS deployed in the same geographical
area are assumed to be synchronized so that the Band 41 BS receivers will not
be interfered by the Band 41 BS transmission. Therefore, the 3^rd^ IMD
products of BS transmitting two contiguous carriers in Band 41will not fall
into the BS receive band of any operating band currently defined in the 3GPP
standards for use in the same geographical area.
### 6.51.2 Co-existence studies for 1 UL/3 DL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 25, Band
41 and Band 41 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.51.2-1 below:
Table 6.51.2-1: Band 25, Band 41 and Band 41 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6922 7375
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.51.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (25 + 41 + 41) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 39 and 42. However, Bands 1, 3, 9, 10, 33, 34 and 39 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Bands 25 and 41. Moreover, co-
location of Band 25 transmitter and Band 35, 36 or 37 transceiver implies
FDD/TDD co-location on adjacent frequencies which requires the use of certain
site-engineering solutions to avoid mutual interference. Therefore, the focus
here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 2, 4, 22, 23, 25
and 42. Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products will not fall into the BS own
(up to 20 MHz) receive block within Band 25.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 4, 22 or 42
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (25 + 41 + 41) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Band 4, 22 or 42 BS receiver.
But there is not a large frequency gap between Band 25 DL and Bands 2, 23 and
25 UL, and hence Bands 2, 23 and 25 BS receiver desensitization may still be
an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (25 + 41 + 41) BS transmitter should
not share the same antenna with Band 2, 23 or 25 BS receiver to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, or with Band 4, 22 or 42 BS receiver unless the
antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the
PIM will not cause Band 4, 22 or 42 BS receiver desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.
