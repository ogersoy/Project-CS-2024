# Introduction
At the 3GPP TSG RAN #61 meeting, the Study Item description on \"Study on
Smart Congestion Mitigation in E-UTRAN\" was approved [2]. This study covers
improvement of congestion mitigation handling mechanisms in RRC_IDLE, in order
to ensure prioritization of access for initiation of MMTEL voice calls,
depending on the operator scenario.

# 4 Key Issues
## 4.1 Key Issue #1: Prioritization of Mobile Originating MMTEL Voice Services
in E-UTRAN
Considering that the network resources (e.g., RACH resources, number of
RRC_CONNECTED UEs in a cell) are limited, operators need to perform congestion
control according to the nature of congestion scenarios. In scenarios such as
public events (sport matches, fireworks, etc.), traffic rise tends to be
caused by accesses from packet data services. In this case, operator may want
to prioritize MO access for voice services over MO access for data service.
Therefore, instead of applying strong barring to all service, operator may
apply strong barring for packet data but less-strong (or even no barring) for
voice data such as MMTEL-voice.
However, operators that want to prioritize access for voice service in
congestion could not rely on the current congestion mitigation mechanisms, due
to lack of standardization support to allow MMTEL voice service prioritization
in access barring and/or connection establishment. The current standard
mechanism specifies access barring (ACB) for barring MO access of packet data
service, and IMS barring (SSAC) for barring MO access of MMTEL service.
However, in the current standard behaviour, MMTEL call may be barred whenever
ACB is activated. The current standard also does not allow independent barring
between MMTEL service and other packet data service, since according to the
standard behaviour, an MMTEL call will experience double barring when IMS
barring (SSAC) and access barring (ACB) are both activated. The inability of
LTE to prioritize MMTEL voice over other data in connection establishment when
ACB is activated leads to establishment failures of VoLTE calls.
Accordingly, prioritization of mobile originating MMTEL voice services in
E-UTRAN is considered as a key issue of this study.
Note that we study this issue with a higher priority than other issues,
considering that IMS voice is already available in some countries and is
replacing CSFB voice.
# 5 Potential Solutions
## 5.1 Solution 1: QCI based access barring
### 5.1.1 Description
In this solution, UE performs access control based on some existing QoS
related identifiers like QCI, assuming that the UE is already aware of the QCI
of each of its bearers. This approach would follow the QoS concept where the
RAN maintains an abstract view on services by mapping them to a set of QoS
characteristics referred to by a QCI. Services that require different QoS (or
access control) handling should be mapped on another QCI.
### 5.1.2 Evaluation
The evaluation of this solution is provided in Table 5.1.2-1.

In addition, the followings should be addressed for this solution:

  * This solution may have bigger impact of 3GPP specifications and > UE/network implementation than Solution 2.
## 5.2 Solution 2: Skipping ACB for MMTEL voice subject to SSAC
### 5.2.1 Description
The UE skips the ACB check for MMTEL Voice, regardless of whether SSAC
parameters are broadcast or not. The network may control whether or not the UE
performs the ACB check skip following SSAC check. This network control could
be realized by adding a new bit in the SIB.
### 5.2.2 Evaluation

In addition, the followings should be addressed for this solution:

  * If this solution is accepted, it will be discussed in Stage 3 phase > how AS can become aware of established MMTEL-voice call in order > to skip ACB.
## 5.3 Solution 3: Independent ACB for MMTEL voice
### 5.3.1 Description
In this solution, UE RRC applies independent ACB check for MMTEL voice, like
ACB check for CSFB. For prioritization of MMTEL voice, eNB may not broadcast
SSAC barring info for MMTEL voice, while broadcasting new ACB barring info for
MMTEL voice. This solution can be realized either by introducing new ACB
barring info for MMTEL voice or by reusing the existing _ac-BarringForCSFB_ in
SIB2 for MMTEL voice considering that some operators would not use CSFB
solution for voice.
VoLTE UE subject to new barring parameter for MMTEL voice in this solution
would behave like the CSFB UE subject to ac-BarringForCSFB.
### 5.3.2 Evaluation
The evaluation of this solution is provided in Table 5.3.2-1.

In addition, the followings should be addressed for this solution:

  * The study did not conclude whether or not UE needs to skip SSAC > check. If skipping SSAC check is needed, indication from AS to > MMTEL may be needed in UE.
## 5.4 Solution 4: RRC Connection Reject based on New Establishment Cause for
Voice
### 5.4.1 Description
In this solution, a new value of MO voice is defined in Establishment Cause of
RRC Connection Request message to inform eNB that UE is accessing for MO
voice. This solution allows eNB to recognize access for MO voice in connection
establishment, and helps eNB to accept some connection requests for voice
services while rejecting other connection requests for non-voice services.

Establishment Cause of RRC Connection Request message needs to be specified.

should implement handling of new establishment cause in connection
establishments for admission control.

In addition, the followings should be addressed for this solution:
  * This solution cannot prioritize MMTEL-voice call in case where ACB > is broadcast, since the MMTEL-voice call in the UE may be barred > by ACB.

  * If connection reject/release is used only, there can be overload > problems on Random Access before the establishment cause is even > known by the network.
  * The study did not conclude whether AS can become aware of > established MMTEL-voice call in order to set the intended > establishment cause.
## 5.5 Solution 5: Individual up- and downscaling of random access probability
(ac-Barring-Factor)
### 5.5.1 Description
_In this solution, UE performs access control based on some existing access
baring factors and optionally backoff time where the individual scaling factor
is either provided per specific use case/application (here VoLTE) via system
information broadcast or a pre-configuration for an individual UE was applied
by using dedicated signaling._

In addition, the followings should be addressed for this solution:

  * This solution will introduce the new functionality overlapped with > current MMTEL barring mechanism.

  * How to map services to different scaling groups is unclear.
  * The study did not conclude whether AS can become aware of > established MMTEL-voice call in order to apply the new barring > mechanism (instead of legacy ACB).
# 6 Conclusion
The study only focused on the prioritization of mobile-originated MMTEL Voice
Services in E-UTRAN.
It is agreed that the following solution is feasible for the prioritization of
mobile-originated MMTEL Voice Services in E-UTRAN:
  * The network indicates whether or not the UE performs the ACB check > skip following SSAC check. The UE skips the ACB check for MMTEL > Voice based on the indication, regardless of whether SSAC > parameters are broadcast or not.
This solution which is based on solution 2 is the preferred one and meets SA1
requirements in [3].
The followings are also agreed for this solution:
  * The indication is included in SIB2.
  * The indication is valid for Access Classes 0-9 and 11-15.
  * 3 bits in SIB2 indicate whether or not access attempts for MMTel > voice, MMTel video and SMS shall skip ACB functionality, > respectively.
It is recommended that this solution is specified in Release 12 Stage 3
specifications. Implementation of this solution in earlier releases than
Release 12 should be considered.
In addition, RAN2 discussed the following potential impacts of the solution
with regards to interworking between RRC, NAS and IMS layer:
> 1\. Coordination between upper layer and RRC in order for RRC to determine
> when to skip the ACB functionality.
>
> 2\. Coordination between NAS and RRC to ensure that, when ACB is applicable
> and ACB skip is configured, NAS is able to generate a Service Request for
> MMTEL or SMS even though NAS has previously been informed that access
> barring is applicable e.g., for other data packet call.
The coordination will be further discussed during Stage 3 phase, with
involvement of CT1.
Prioritization of MMTEL video and SMS was not in the original scope of this
study. However, due to new requirements defined by SA1 prioritization of MMTEL
video and SMS was also covered here. Therefore, it is recommended that
skipping the ACB check is also specified in Release 12 Stage 3 specifications
for prioritization of mobile originating MMTEL video access attempts and
mobile originating SMS access attempts in accordance with SA1 requirements in
[4].
