# 4 Background
## 4.1 Task description
The present document presents scenarios for 3 CC downlink non-contiguous
intra-band carrier aggregation for Band 41. To meet the market requirements of
operators, bandwidth demands are increasing constantly. As such, to meet the
market requirements of operators, especially in markets where contiguous
spectrum is less available to an operator, other schemes are needed. Two CC
carrier aggregation has been a successful mechanism to provide this additional
bandwidth in some cases. However, there are still market requirements which
require even higher bandwidth and greater flexibility. The next logical step
in downlink carrier aggregation is to aggregate 3 CCs on the downlink. This
work item proposes 3 CC intra-band non-contiguous DL CA with no changes to the
UL.
The WID for this work item was approved at RAN#62, December 2013, in RP-131694
[2].
The purpose and objectives of this work item are:
\- Building on the LTE intra-band 2-CC CA work completed for Band 41, specify
the core RF requirements for 3-CC non-contiguous DL intra-band CA in Band 41.
The aggregation scenarios to be specified as 2-contiguous CCs and 1 non-
contiguous CC, with a single sub-block gap, see Tables 2 and 3 in [2].
\- Add a bandwidth combination set to CA_41A-41A, see Table 1 in [2].
\- Modify CA_41C bandwidth combination set 0 to include 5 MHz in TS 36.101
Table 5.6A.1-1.

## 5.3 Specific UE RF requirements
### 5.3.1 Maximum input level
The 3-DL non-contiguous CA in band 41 consists of adding together the already-
existing 2-CC CA_41C with a single B41 carrier therefore no new requirements
are needed, however test configurations need to be defined to TS 36.101 as
follows:
##### _\"7.4.1A Minimum requirements for CA_ {#a-minimum-requirements-for-ca
.H6}
> _For combinations of intra-band contiguous and intra-band non-contiguous
> carrier aggregation with three downlink carriers assigned to one E-UTRA
> band, the requirement is defined with the uplink configuration in accordance
> with Table 7.3.1A-3. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet the
> maximum input-level requirements for intra-band contiguous carrier
> aggregation of two downlink carriers and for the remaining component carrier
> the requirements specified in subclause 7.4.1. The three downlink carriers
> shall be active throughout the tests.\"_
### 5.3.2 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
The 3-DL non-contiguous CA in band 41 consists of adding together the already-
existing 2-CC CA_41C with a single B41 carrier therefore no new requirements
are needed, however test configurations need to be defined to TS 36.101 as
follows:
##### _\"7.5.1A Minimum requirements for CA_ {#a-minimum-requirements-for-ca-1
.H6}
> _For combinations of intra-band contiguous and intra-band non-contiguous
> carrier aggregation with three downlink carriers assigned to one E-UTRA
> band, the requirement is defined with the uplink configuration in accordance

> adjacent channel selectivity requirements for intra-band contiguous carrier
> aggregation of two downlink carriers and for the remaining component carrier
> the requirements specified in subclause 7.5.1 subject to in-gap and out-of-
> gap interferers. The three downlink carriers shall be active throughout the
> tests. The interferer power is set to the larger value between those
> specified in subclause 7.5.1 and 7.5.1A. The power level of the carrier(s)
> other than the carrier(s) that the interfering signal is located with
> respect to is increased so as to keep the ACS level specified in subclause
> 7.5.1 or 7.5.1A.\"_
### 5.3.3 VOID
### 5.3.4 VOID
### 5.3.5 Reference sensitivity power level
Clause 7.3.1A in TS 36.101 deals with the reference sensitivity requirements
for CA. In general TDD intra-band CA does not change the UE reference
sensitivity requirement for CA, and as Band 41 does not introduce any new
requirements that impact CA aspects of reference sensitivity, no changes need
to be made to the existing CA requirements.
However the following changes are required in the definition of the uplink
configuration to support reference sensitivity testing:
\- Add N/A for 100RB+25RB of CA_41C into Table 7.3.1A-1 in accordance with
modifying the bandwidth combination set 1 of 5 MHz + 20 MHz with no changes to
the UL.
\- Add a row in Table 7.3.1A-3 for CA41A-41C and CA41C-CA41 to describe the UL
allocation that shall be used for the case of a UE that supports 3-CC DL
intra-band non- contiguous CA for Band 41
These changes are shown in the following tables.

NOTE 1: The carrier centre frequency of SCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL operating band. NOTE 2: The transmitted power over both PCC and SCC shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5A in TS 36.101. NOTE 3: The UL resource blocks in both PCC and SCC shall be confined within the transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.6-1 in TS 36.101). NOTE 4: The UL resource blocks in PCC shall be located as close as possible to the downlink operating band, while the UL resource blocks in SCC shall be located as far as possible from the downlink operating band. NOTE 5: In case a CA configuration consists of CC channel bandwidths which are unequal in bandwidth the PCC channel bandwidth shall be the larger one for reference sensitivity test. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The 3-DL non-contiguous CA in band 41 consists of adding together the already-
existing 2-CC CA_41C with a single B41 carrier therefore no new requirements
are needed, however test configurations need to be defined to TS 36.101 as
follows:

## 5.4 Specific BS RF requirements
The current requirements specified in TS 36.104 and TS 36.141 for BS capable
of multi-carrier and/or CA operation in contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
in single band are agnostic to the number of CC in each of the two sub-blocks
within the operating band supported by the BS in intra-band non-contiguous CA
operation, and thus can be applied for 3-CC non-contiguous intra-band DL CA in
Band 41. Hence no change in the BS requirements is needed.
However, the acronym \'CA_41-41\' in the Table 5.5-4 in TS 36.104 and TS
36.141 may be mis-interpreted that two CC instead of two sub-blocks are
supported within each operating band. This should be clarified in the BS
specifications as shown below.
Table 5.5-4. Intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation bands (with two
sub-blocks)

CA Band E-UTRA operating band
CA_3-3 3 CA_4-4 4 CA_7-7 7 CA_23-23 23 CA_25-25 25 CA_41-41 41

### 5.4.1 Co-existence studies for BS
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of contiguous or non-contiguous Band 41 DL carriers can be
calculated as shown in Table 5.4.1-1 below:
Table 5.4.1-1: Band 41 DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f-low f-high DL frequency (MHz) 2496 2690
2^nd^ harmonics frequency limits (MHz) 4992 5380 3^rd^ harmonics frequency
limits (MHz) 7488 8070
2^nd^ order IMD products (f-low -- f-high) (f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) -194 194
3^rd^ order IMD products (2*f-low -- f-high) (2*f-high -- f-low) IMD frequency
limits (MHz) 2302 2884
3^rd^ order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth for contiguous CA)
(f-low -- BWmax) (f-high + BWmax) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2436 2750
* * *
It can be seen from Table 5.4.1-1 that the 3^rd^ order IMD products of BS
transmitting contiguous or non-contiguous carriers in Band 41 may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 7, 30, 38, 40 and 41. Note that for contiguous
CA, the calculation in Table 5.4.1-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is
transmitting with the whole 194 MHz DL frequency of Band 41. If the BS is only
transmitting an up to 60 MHz DL in Band 41 as stated in the WIDS, then the
3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of the Band 30 or 40
as shown in the last row in Table 5.4.1-1.
Note that Bands 7 and 38 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Band 41, and the 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting CA of Band
41 will not cause BS receiver desensitization with synchronized Band 40 or 41
TDD operations. Therefore, the focus here will be on the IMD falling into Band
30.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 30
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band 41 BS transmitters
do not share the same antenna with Band 30 BS receiver.
On the other hand, it is recommended that Band 41 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 30 BS receiver in order to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^
order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 30 BS receiver
desensitization.
