# 4 Background
Band 23 is a major FDD band which has been allocated in the US. The US
regulatory rules require strict power and emissions limits for the UE
operating in Band 23 in order to protect adjacent operations below 2000 MHz
[3]. A new network-signalled value (NS_20), along with accompanying A-MPR
tables, is established in TS 36.101 for Band 23 for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz
channel bandwidths. Figures 4-1 and 4-2 show the A-MPR values specified for 10
MHz (centred at 2015 MHz) and 15 MHz uplink carriers, respectively. The
overall uplink user and sector performances will be negatively impacted by the
A-MPR restrictions imposed on the first 15 resource blocks (RBs) for the 15
MHz uplink carrier. The 10 MHz uplink carrier, on the other hand, is
relatively free of A-MPR restrictions.

Figure 4-2: A-MPR values for Band 23 15 MHz uplink carrier
An intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation for Band 23 is needed to
minimize the amount of stranded (i.e. unused) uplink spectrum to the 2000-2005
MHz band only, when a 10 MHz uplink carrier is deployed in the Band to
circumvent A-MPR restrictions imposed on wider uplink carrier configurations.
The suggested intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation allows Band 23
operator(s) to aggregate two downlink component carriers with a single 10 MHz
uplink component carrier for an increased DL capacity, while preserving paired
DL spectrum for the 2005-2010 MHz uplink spectrum. The only deployment
scenario for this aggregation would involve two downlink (DL) component
carriers, separated by no less than 5 MHz, with a single uplink (UL) component
carrier.
In current RAN4 carrier aggregation (CA) work, several intra-band cases have
been approved, studied, and discussed to determine feasibility and the RF
requirements needed to introduce such scenarios. These include intra-band
scenarios where the applicable LTE frequency band is situated at or near 2 GHz
(for instance, Band 3, Band 4 and Band 25). Building on these earlier intra-
band carrier aggregation precedencies, the referenced work item [2] proposes
to start the work on intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation for Band 23
to support deployment of LTE-advanced.
## 4.1 Task Descriptions
This WI is to specify the band specific core and performance requirements for
non‑contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation in band 23:
1) Specifying the core requirements for BS and UE in RAN4 specifications, and
taking the coexistence with nearby frequency bands into account, including
Band 2 and Band 25.
2) Specify band specific RRM requirements in RAN4 if any.
3) Signalling support in RAN2 specifications if any.
4) Performance requirements for BS and UE in RAN4 specifications.
## 4.2 Spectrum and regulatory aspects
This Work Item is based on the spectrum arrangement as shown in Table 4.2-1.
Table 4.2-1 Frequency arrangements in the band 2 000‑2 020 (with 2 180‑2 200)
MHz

C1 2000-2020 160 2180-2200 180 FDD UL and guard
* * *
The frequency band 2000‑2020 MHz is paired with 2180‑2200 MHz for FDD
operation, where the mobile terminals transmit within the lower band and the
base stations transmit within the upper band. These paired spectrum blocks are
designated as "Band 23" in 3GPP E-UTRA specifications. Band 23 has been
allocated and licensed for use in Region 2.
The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules requires that the band
2000-2020 MHz meet the following emissions limits [3]:
● 1930 -- 1990 MHz: -50 dBm/MHz
● 1990 -- 1999 MHz: -40 dBm/MHz
● 1999 -- 2000 MHz: -40 dBm/(1 % Channel Bandwidth)
The FCC also limits the EIRP in the frequency range 2000 -- 2005 MHz to 7 dBm.
# 5 Band and Channel Arrangements
## 5.1 CA operating bands
E-UTRA CA for Band 23 is defined to operate in the entire Band 23 range, as
defined in Table 5.1-1.

## 5.2 CA channel bandwidth
Table 5.2-1 defines the supported E-UTRA bandwidths for intra-band non-
contiguous CA in Band 23. 5 and 10 MHz component carrier (CC) channel
bandwidths are proposed to be supported in Band 23 intra-band non-contiguous
carrier aggregation.

* * *
Combinations of component carriers with unequal channel bandwidth should be
considered for Band 23, specifically combinations of 5 + 10 MHz.
## 5.3 Supporting intra-band CA with 1 CC UL
The proposed intra-band non-contiguous CA for Band 23 is supported by 2 CCs on
the DL, separated by at least 5 MHz, and 1 CC on the UL. The only recommended
CA_23-23 configuration is:
● 5+10 MHz DL aggregation with upper 10 MHz portion in Band 23 UL
Figure 5.3-1 illustrates the proposed CA_23-23 configuration.

# 6 E-UTRA RF requirements for UE
## 6.1 Transmitter Characteristics
No new requirements since the proposed CA consists of a single uplink CC.
## 6.2 Receiver Characteristics
## 6.2.1 Reference Sensitivity
Band 23 has a large duplex cap of 160 MHz and downlink/uplink band is 20 MHz
wide, as shown in Figure 6.2.1-1. The standard non-CA uplink allocations for
the REFSENS test, as specified in Table 7.3.1-2 of TS 36.101, is consistent
with the values in Table 5.6-1 of the same spec, even for the maximum 20 MHz
bandwidth configuration. Therefore, it is proposed that no restrictions are
necessary for the uplink allocation during the REFSENS test for intra-band
non-contiguous CA in Band 23 (CA_23A-23A). Proposed intra-band non-contiguous
CA uplink allocation for REFSENS for CA_23A-23A is shown in Table 6.2.1-1.

## 6.3 E-UTRA coexistence requirements
No new requirements since the proposed CA consists of a single uplink CC.
# 7 E-UTRA RRM requirements for UE
The proposed intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation in Band 23
(CA_23A-23A) involves aggregating two downlink component carriers (CCs),
specifically 10 MHz and 5 MHz CCs. This configuration is DL only CA and only a
single UL CC is used. After studying the current TS 36.133, it is determined
that new RRM test cases covering 10 MHz + 5 MHz CA configuration would be
needed. Additionally, new RMC and OCNG patterns for 5 MHz TDD carrier would
need to be defined.
## 7.1 RRM Test Cases
New test cases verifying the core RRM requirements for 10 MHz + 5 MHz CA
configuration are shown below:

## 7.3 OCNG Patterns
New OCNG patterns for 5 MHz TDD channel bandwidth are defined with outer RB
and full RB allocations. The inner 11 RBs are used for the RMC (PDSCH) in OCNG
pattern with outer RB allocation. The proposed OCNG patterns for TDD are
defined as follows:

# 8 E-UTRA RF requirements for BS
The proposed intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation in Band 23
(CA_23A-23A) involves aggregating two downlink component carriers (CCs) with
the maximum aggregation bandwidth not exceeding 20 MHz. Band 23 already
supports a 20 MHz bandwidth configuration and there are no additional BS RF
requirements needed for CA_23A-23A. Table 8-1 shows a new CA_23-23 entry to be
added to TS 36.104 operating bands.

# 9 E-UTRA demodulation performance for BS and UE
## 9.1 BS performance
No new BS demodulation performance requirements are needed since only a single
UL CC is used for the CA configuration.
## 9.2 UE performance
The proposed intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation in Band 23
(CA_23A-23A) involves aggregating two downlink component carriers (CCs),
specifically 10 MHz and 5 MHz CCs. This configuration is DL only CA and only a
single UL CC is used. After studying the current TS 36.101, it is determined
that new demodulation performance test cases covering 10 MHz + 5 MHz CA
configuration would be needed. The scope of the new demodulation performance
test cases is agreed in [4] as follows:
● Specify new CA normal tests with TM3
○ Propagation condition and antenna configuration: EVA70 2x2 Low
○ Use the R.11-2 FDD for 5MHz
○ Reuse the test parameters specified in Table 8.2.1.3.1-1
● Specify new CA CQI test
○ Use the same test setup and metrics as the existing CA CQI test
● No new power imbalance test is required
● No new soft buffer management test is required
● Do not specify the sustained data rate test with 10MHz+5MHz for Band 23
intra-band NC CA performance requirements
○ If CA 23A-23A is the only CA configuration supported in the UE, apply single
carrier SDR test
● Focus on FDD performance requirements
