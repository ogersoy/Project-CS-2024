# 1 Scope
Positioning mechanisms were specified in 3GPP as a key feature for E-UTRA
networks since Release 9, e.g. OTDOA, E-CID etc. They are not only used in
helping meet regulatory requirements, but also utilized with increasing
importance to enable all kinds of location based applications.
The proliferation of heterogeneous network deployments brings some challenges
also in the area of efficient terminal positioning and calls for the study of
enhanced mechanisms and positioning performance requirements.
The addition of multiple nodes in heterogeneous networks can improve the
position accuracy remarkably if the specificities of such deployments are
taken into account in the positioning mechanisms. Some examples include the
support of several transmission points with identical cell IDs and improved
support for positioning in carrier aggregation.
Furthermore, the accuracy of current positioning mechanisms and in particular
OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is only defined
for limited scenarios:
  * Limited channel bandwidth for the cells to be measured (reference and neighbour cells)
  * Tests defined assuming single Tx antenna. Practical network might have Tx diversity on antenna port 6 which is used for RSTD measurements
It is desirable to study the possibility of enhanced accuracy for other
practical deployment scenarios.
The present document is the Technical Report for the Study Item on positioning
enhancements for E-UTRA.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Study item objective
The objective is to study accuracy enhancements for current positioning
mechanisms such as OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement in heterogeneous deployment scenarios and different system
bandwidths.
The feasibility of improving the existing UE positioning performance
requirements of OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
shall be studied for the following cases:
  * Larger available bandwidths (e.g. 15 and 20MHz for OTDOA and 10, 15, and 20 MHz for E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement).
  * Smaller available bandwidths (e.g. 1.4 and 3 MHz for OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement)
  * Possible use of downlink Tx diversity for the positioning reference signals (PRS), e.g., schemes transparent to UE, and its impact on the both UE and system performance and/or complexity. Use of non-transparent schemes can be discussed.
  * Deployment of RRHs with identical cell IDs for OTDOA and E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.
  * Carrier aggregation scenarios (including scenarios with multiple TAs for E-CID based on UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement)
The study includes the definition of the above mentioned scenarios in an
initial phase.

### 6.3.2 RSTD Estimation with Diversity
A general structure for TOA estimation with diversity is shown in Figure
6.3.2-1 below, where the diversity system has _P_ branches. The TOA is
estimated independently at each diversity branch of the receiver, and then a
"combining algorithm" is used to process the TOA estimates from all branches
to obtain a desired "optimum" estimate for RSTD calculation.
Figure 6.3.2-1: General Structure of TOA Estimation with Diversity Techniques.
A variety of different combining algorithms can be designed for different
diversity techniques. Two examples were used for the simulation results in
subclause 6.3.3:
  1. ${\hat{\tau}}_{0} = \text{min}\left{ {\hat{\tau}}_{o}^{i} \right}$ ("Method #1")
  2. ${\hat{\tau}}_{0} = \frac{1}{P}\sum_{i = 1}^{P}{\hat{\tau}}_{0}^{(i)}$ ("Method #2")
Other possibilities may be to include a weighting factor, where the estimate
of each diversity branch is weighted with a coefficient that reflects the
quality of the TOA estimation at each branch.
For the simulation results in subclause 6.3.3, _P=2_ has been used as defined
in the simulation assumptions (subclause 6.3.1).
### 6.3.3 Performance characterization
In this clause the performance gains are evaluated by using link level
simulations based on the simulation assumptions in clause 6.3.1.

The following Figures compare the results with combining method #1 and method
#2 defined in subclause 6.3.2 (i.e., min. TOA is selected as final TOA and
average TOA is selected as the final TOA, respectively) for the Urban A
example:

(a) **Time Diversity Benefit:** \ The curves "No Diversity" in Figure
6.3.3.1.1.1-1 show the benefit from time diversity; i.e., a single TX antenna
is used but two PRS occasions which are combined as described in subclause
6.3.2 above. With combining method #1 (min TOA), a time diversity effect is
exploited. The performance is about 1.5 Ts better at the 70^th^ percentile
compared to the use of a single PRS occasion.\ \ Due to the fading, the two
TOAs estimated are slightly different, and picking the smallest TOA among the
two as a final TOA estimate should provide a TOA as close as possible to the
desired line-of-sight TOA.\ \ With combining method #2 (average TOA),
essentially no time diversity benefit is obtained. The "No Diversity" curve in
Figure 6.3.3.1.1.1-1 (right hand side) overlap with the result of a single PRS
occasion (baseline). The average TOA over two consecutive occasions is (on
average) similar to the TOA estimated from a single occasion.
(b) **Antenna Switching Benefit:\** With the given channel models, antenna
switching does not provide an additional performance benefit compared to the
use of a single antenna ("No Diversity").\ \ With combining method #1 (Min
TOA) the benefit is essentially due to time diversity. With combining method
#2 (average TOA), no benefit compared to a single PRS occasion can be obtained
(the same as (a) above).
(c) **TX Diversity 1 (Power splitting with sign flip):\** This technique shows
worse performance compared to no diversity; slightly worse with combining
method #1, and considerably worse with combining method #2. With combining
method #2, the performance is even worse compared to the base line result with
a single PRS occasion.\ \ In the first PRS occasion, the sum of the two TX
signals is used at the receiver; for the second PRS occasion the difference of
the two TX signals is used at the receiver. With the given channel models,
this means that most of the signal is canceled in the second occasion. With
combining method #1, we pick the TOA mostly from the first occasion; with
combining method #2, we compute an average TOA, but since the TOA from the
2^nd^ occasion is quite bad (since components cancel due to the 180 degrees
phase shift), the final TOA get worse compared to the use of a single
occasion.\ \ With combining method #1, we essentially use the TOA from the
first occasion only, and therefore, no additional time diversity. The benefit
here comes primarily from space diversity only, where the two TX signals in
the first occasion are added from the two antennas. With the given channel
models, space diversity alone does not provide the same benefit as time
diversity alone. Therefore, the performance with method #1 is worse compared
to no diversity (i.e., time diversity only), but still better compared to the
baseline with a single PRS occasion only.
(d) **TX Diversity 2 (Power splitting):\** This technique shows the best
performance in the simulations. Here, in both occasions the signal from the
two antennas adds up at the receiver. There are two different TOAs available
(compared to a single "good" TOA as in case of TX Diversity 1, where the
signal in the second occasion mostly cancel), and by picking the smallest
among the two TOAs, both, time and space diversity is exploited. The benefit
with combining method #1 is about 2.5 Ts compared to a single PRS occasion at
the 70^th^ percentile; and about 1.5 Ts compared to time diversity only ("No
Diversity") at the 70^th^ percentile.\ \ Also with combining method #2, a gain
can be obtained, which is however, slightly worse compared to combining
technique #1. The average TOA is always more biased than a single selected
TOA.
#### 6.3.3.2 Conclusions from interested companies
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------+ | Qualcomm (R4-141826) | Under the given simulation assumptions and | | | channel models, some TX Diversity schemes | | | can achieve about 1 -- 2Ts improvement, if | | | the UE processes the PRS occasions | | | accordingly. E.g., processes nonconsecutive | | | occasions and does not treat each occasion | | | equally for estimating a final TOA to | | | calculate the RSTD. Otherwise, it is | | | possible that TX diversity performs worse | | | compared to no diversity. Processing PRS | | | occasions accordingly require at the UE the | | | knowledge that TX diversity for PRS is being | | | used at the eNodeB. If this is not the case, | | | the PRS should not be transmitted from more | | | than a single antenna. | | | | | | The results also show that the performance | | | improvement with TX Diversity depends on the | | | channel model so without channel information | | | at the TX side it may not be possible to | | | obtain any performance gains. | +----------------------+----------------------------------------------+
7 Feasibility on enhancement for OTDOA and E-CID with identical cell ID RRHs
## 7.1 General
\
## 7.2 Network Scenarios
In certain het-net deployments, some non-collocated RRHs have the identical
PCI with the associated Macro cell so that these RRHs transmit the identical
reference signals, and therefore it may cause ambiguousness on reference
signal ToA detection. Scenarios to be studied:
  * OTDOA scenario: RRH with PCI identical to the associated Macro cell
  * E-CID scenario: RRH with PCI identical to the associated Macro cell
