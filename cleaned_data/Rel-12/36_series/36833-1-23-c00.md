# 4 Background
Band 23 is a major FDD band which has been allocated in the US. The US
regulatory rules require strict power and emissions limits for the UE
operating in Band 23 in order to protect adjacent operations below 2000 MHz
[3]. A new network-signalled value (NS_20), along with accompanying A-MPR
tables, is established in TS 36.101 for Band 23 for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz
channel bandwidths.
An intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation for Band 23 is needed to exploit
the full 20 MHz downlink spectrum available in the band without allocating a
matching 20 MHz uplink carrier. The suggested intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation allows Band 23 operator(s) to select different uplink carrier
sizes with varying degrees of A-MPR restrictions, without sacrificing the full
downlink capacity. The only deployment scenario for this aggregation would
involve two downlink (DL) component carriers with a single uplink (UL)
component carrier.
In current RAN4 carrier aggregation (CA) work, several intra-band cases have
been approved, studied, and discussed to determine feasibility and the RF
requirements needed to introduce such scenarios. These include intra-band
scenarios where the applicable LTE frequency band is situated at or near 2 GHz
(for instance, Band 3, Band 4, and Band 25). Also, the WI for intra-band
contiguous CA case involving CA Bandwidth Class B configuration was approved
for Band 27 [4]. Building on these earlier intra-band carrier aggregation
precedencies, the referenced work item [2] proposes to start the work on
intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation for Band 23 to support deployment of
LTE-advanced.
## 4.1 Task Descriptions
This WI is to specify the band specific core and performance requirements for
intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation in band 23:
1) Specifying the core requirements for BS and UE in RAN4 specifications, and
taking the coexistence with nearby frequency bands into account, including
Band 2 and Band 25.
2) Specify band specific RRM requirements in RAN4 if any.
3) Signalling support in RAN2 specifications if any.
4) Performance requirements for BS and UE in RAN4 specifications.
## 4.2 Spectrum and regulatory aspects
This Work Item is based on the spectrum arrangement as shown in Table 4.2-1.
Table 4.2-1 Frequency arrangements in the band 2000‑2020 (with 2180‑2200) MHz
* * *
Frequency arrangement Mobile station transmitter\ Centre gap\ Base station
transmitter\ Duplex separation\ Centre gap usage (MHz) (MHz) (MHz) (MHz)
C1 2000-2020 160 2180-2200 180 FDD UL and guard
* * *
The frequency band 2000‑2020 MHz is paired with 2180‑2200 MHz for FDD
operation, where the mobile terminals transmit within the lower band and the
base stations transmit within the upper band. These paired spectrum blocks are
designated as "Band 23" in 3GPP E-UTRA specifications. Band 23 has been
allocated and licensed for use in Region 2.
The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules requires that the band
2000-2020 MHz meet the following emissions limits [3]:
● 1930 -- 1990 MHz: -50 dBm/MHz
● 1990 -- 1999 MHz: -40 dBm/MHz
● 1999 -- 2000 MHz: -40 dBm/(1 % Channel Bandwidth)
The FCC also limits the EIRP in the frequency range 2000 -- 2005 MHz to 7 dBm.
# 5 Band and Channel Arrangements
## 5.1 CA operating bands
E-UTRA CA for Band 23 is defined to operate in the entire Band 23 range, as
defined in Table 5.1-1.

## 5.2 CA channel bandwidth
Table 5.2-1 defines the supported E-UTRA bandwidths for intra-band contiguous
CA in Band 23. 5, 10 and 15 MHz component carrier (CC) channel bandwidths are
proposed to be supported in Band 23 intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation.
Table 5.2-1: E-UTRA CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets defined
for intra-band contiguous CA
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | E-UTRA CA | | | | | | co | | | | | | nfiguration | | | | | | / Bandwidth | | | | | | combination | | | | | | set | | | | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | E-UTRA CA | 50RB+50RB | 75RB+25RB | Maximum | Bandwidth | | Co | | | aggregated | Combination | | nfiguration | (10 MHz + | (15 MHz + 5 | bandwidth | Set | | | 10 MHz) | MHz) | | | | | | | [MHz] | | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | CA_23B | Yes | Yes | 20 | 0 | +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
Combinations of CCs with unequal channel bandwidth should be considered for
Band 23, specifically combinations of 5 + 15 MHz.
## 5.3 Supporting intra-band CA with 1 CC UL
The proposed intra-band contiguous CA for Band 23 is supported by 2 CCs on the
DL and 1 CC on the UL. Allowable CA_23 deployment configurations are:
● 10+10 MHz DL aggregation with upper 10 MHz portion in Band 23 UL
● 5+15 MHz DL aggregation with upper 15 MHz portion in Band 23 UL
Figure 5.3-1 illustrates the proposed CA_23 deployment configurations.
{width="5.7625in" height="3.2256944444444446in"}
Figure 5.3-1: Intra-band contiguous CA configurations in Band 23
In the proposed CA_23 deployment, the downlink secondary component carrier
(SCC) is closer to the uplink component carrier than the downlink primary
component carrier (PCC). Due to Band 23's large channel gap of 160 MHz,
placing the downlink SCC closer to the uplink CC is not expected to impact the
UE sensitivity. Although it is not the proposed CA_23B deployment
configuration, placement of the downlink PCC closer to the uplink CC for UE
sensitivity testing purpose is acceptable for CA_23B.
# 6 E-UTRA RF requirements for UE
## 6.1 Transmitter Characteristics
No new requirements are needed since the proposed CA consists of a single
uplink CC.
## 6.2 Receiver Characteristics
### 6.2.1 Reference Sensitivity
CA_23B consists of two downlink component carriers (CCs) and a singe uplink
CC. According to Section 7.3.1A in TS 36.101, for intra-band contiguous CA
with a single uplink carrier, the maximum number of allocated uplink resource
blocks for the REFSENS test is the same as the single carrier REFSENS
requirement specified in Table 7.3.1-2. No CA_23B specific changes are
required in the specification.
### 6.2.2 CA Bandwidth Class B Requirements
CA_23B involves aggregating two downlink component carriers (CCs) with the
maximum aggregation bandwidth not exceeding 20 MHz; a CA configuration of CA
Bandwidth Class B. The generic UE receiver requirements for CA Bandwidth Class
B are addressed as apart of the preceding work item for Release-12 intra-band
contiguous CA in Band 27 (LTE_CA_C_B27) and are documented in the technical
report for the work item, TR 36.833-1-27.
## 6.3 E-UTRA coexistence requirements
No new requirements are needed since the proposed CA consists of a single
uplink CC.
# 7 E-UTRA RRM requirements for UE
A study of the existing technical specifications was conducted. The study
concluded that no additions to UE RRM specifications are required.
# 8 E-UTRA RF requirements for BS
The proposed intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation in Band 23 (CA_23B)
involves aggregating two downlink component carriers (CCs) with the maximum
aggregation bandwidth not exceeding 20 MHz. Band 23 already supports a 20 MHz
bandwidth configuration and there are no additional BS RF requirements needed
for CA_23B. Table 8-1 shows a new CA_23 entry to be added to TS 36.104
operating bands.

# 9 E-UTRA demodulation performance for BS and UE
A study of the UE and BS demodulation performance requirements in Section 8 of
TS 36.101 and TS 36.104 was conducted. Since the demodulation performance
requirements in both specifications are band agnostic, and it was determined
that CA_23B does not require any specific UE and BS demodulation performance
requirements.
CA_23B involves aggregating two downlink component carriers (CCs) with the
maximum aggregation bandwidth not exceeding 20 MHz; a CA configuration of CA
Bandwidth Class B. The generic UE demodulation performance requirements for CA
Bandwidth Class B are addressed as apart of the preceding work item for
Release-12 intra-band contiguous CA in Band 27 (LTE_CA_C_B27) and are
documented in the technical report for the work item, TR 36.833-1-27.
