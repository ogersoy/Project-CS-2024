# Introduction
At the 3GPP TSG RAN #58 meeting (Dec 2012), the Study Item Description on
\"Small Cell Enhancements for E-UTRA and E-UTRAN -- Physical-layer Aspects\"
was agreed for Release 12 [2].
This study covers the technologies for further enhancements of indoor and
outdoor scenarios using low-power node, taking into account the scenarios and
requirements for small cell enhancements captured in 3GPP TR 36.932 [3].
The present document covers the physical-layer aspects of these technologies.
# 1 Scope
The present document contains the result of the study item \"Small Cell
Enhancements for E-UTRA and E-UTRAN -- Physical-layer Aspects\" [2].\ The
purpose of the present document is to help TSG RAN WG1 to define and describe
the potential physical layer small cell enhancements under consideration and
compare the benefits of each enhancement technique, along with the complexity
evaluation of each technique.
This activity involves the Radio Access work area of the 3GPP studies and has
impacts both on the Mobile Equipment and Access Network of the 3GPP systems.
The present document is intended to gather all information and draw a
conclusion on a way forward.
The present document is a \'living\' document, i.e. it is permanently updated
and presented to TSG-RAN meetings.

Within scenarios 2b and 3, all features will at least be evaluated in the
dense cases. Note that this does not preclude evaluation being carried out
equally in other cases for particular features. It is recommended that
spectral efficiency enhancements should be evaluated in sparse cases as well.
# 5 Potential enhancements to improve spectrum efficiency
## 5.1 Introduction of a higher order modulation scheme for the downlink
The high geometry experienced by UEs in some small cell deployments provides
the possibility for introducing higher order modulation scheme (i.e. 256 QAM)
for the downlink transmission. In this section, the potential gain of
introducing 256QAM is summarized from both link level and system level
perspectives.
The link level evaluation results are summarized in Table 5.1-1. The system
level evaluation results are summarized in Tables 5.1-2 and 5.1-3. The
evaluations are performed according to the assumptions shown in Annex A.3. All
UEs in the simulation are assumed to be 256QAM-capable. Rx EVM and impairment
modelling including Rx IQ imbalance are used to model Rx impairments, unless
described otherwise. In both tables, the entries without explicitly mentioning
Rx impairment modelling refer to the cases that no Rx impairments is modelled.
Different Rx EVM modelling may be used in the simulations.
In Tables 5.1-2 and 5.1-3, the entries without mentioning CRS interference
refer to the cases that CRS interference is not modelled.

The evaluation results show that:
  * The potential gains of 256 QAM are dependent on Tx EVM being around 4% or less, and are more sensitive to practical Rx impairments, especially IQ imbalance, than to Tx EVM.
  * In the link level simulations, the minimum SINR for which a gain is observed as following:
    * The minimum SINR for which a gain is observed is around 18dB\~24dB with rank1 transmission.
    * For transmission with rank 2 or with rank adaptation, with 0% Tx EVM, the minimum SINR for which a gain is observed is around 20dB\~30dB.
    * For transmission with rank 2 or with rank adaptation, with 4% Tx EVM, eight sources show the minimum SINR for which a gain is observed is around 25dB\~30dB, two companies show the minimum SINR is around 36dB\~38dB.
  * In the link level simulations, the observed maximum spectrum efficiency gain as following:
    * When Tx EVM and Rx impairments are not modelled, the observed maximum spectrum efficiency gain is 15%\~33%.
    * When Tx EVM is assumed to be 4%:
      * The observed maximum spectrum efficiency gain is 10%\~30% without considering Rx impairments. One source shows 3% maximum spectrum efficiency gain without considering Rx impairments.
      * The observed maximum spectrum efficiency gain is 0\~17% with 1.5\~4% Rx EVM.
    * When Tx EVM is assumed to be 3%:
      * The observed maximum spectrum efficiency gain is 0%\~22% with 1.5%\~4% Rx EVM.
    * The different evaluations between the sources result from different assumptions, such as Tx/Rx EVM, transmission rank and transmission schemes.
    * According to the sources with Rx impairment modelled as Rx EVM, the observed maximum spectrum efficiency gain degrades when Rx impairment is modelled. According to the one source with modelling of Rx IQ imbalance with -25dB IMRR, no gains from 256QAM were observed.
  * In the system level simulations without applying transmit power back-off:
    * Considering realistic scenarios of CRS interference modelling, 3% and 4% Tx EVM and 1.5%\~4% Rx EVM assumed,
      * 0%\~5% gain on cell average UPT is observed for the scenarios of S2a.
      * 5%\~13% gain on cell average UPT is observed for the scenarios of S2b.
      * 7%\~30% gain on cell average UPT is observed for scenario S3.
    * Considering unrealistic scenarios of not modeling the CRS interference, 4% Tx EVM and 1.5%\~4% Rx EVM assumed, simulations results indicate the theoretical upper bounds of 4.4%\~16% gain on cell average UPT is observed for the scenario S2a, 4.9%\~19% gain on cell average UPT is observed for scenarios of S3 sparse.
RAN4 [9] has the following observations concluded from relevant discussions
and investigations:
  * For Tx EVM
    * Transmitter EVM for 256QAM can be modelled as an AWGN component.
    * Based on RAN4 discussion, low power BS such as 20dBm and 24dBm may achieve a better EVM such as 3\~4% with power back-off and/or relaxed clipping at the cost of decreased coverage, increased price and size. But RAN4 has not yet evaluated guaranteed minimum performance of Tx EVM.
  * For Rx EVM,
    * Applicable Rx impairments can be modelled by an equivalent AWGN component at the receiver.
    * UE\'s may achieve Rx EVM in the range of 1.5\~4% as typical performance depending on operating band frequency and implementation. But RAN4 has not yet evaluated guaranteed minimum performance of Rx EVM.
Based on the RAN4 LS feedback in [9], further evaluations are performed based
on the feedback as noted above with slightly different assumpitons on nominal
transmission powers. RX and TX EVM had been taken as listed in the Table 5.1-5
according to the RAN4 feedback.

In this section, it is observed from the system level evaluations that:
  * In scenario 2a sparse, the cell average UPT gain with 256QAM without applying transmit power back-off is 0\~5% with CRS interference modeling
```{=html}
``` \- If 256QAM is operated without an additional implementation specific
solution, e.g., adjusting cell association bias, the gain for eNB with
transmission power of 30dBm decreases and even show loss due to shrinkage of
small cell coverage with transmit power back-off from 30dBm to 23,22,21dBm
  * Cell mean UPT reduction is less than 2% with transmit power back-off from 30dBm to 28dBm
  * Cell mean UPT reduction is less than 7% with transmit power back-off from 24dBm to 21dBm
  * Note that RAN4 did not provide EVM values for eNB transmission power of 30 dBm
```{=html}
``` \- In scenario 2b sparse, the cell average UPT gain with 256QAM is 5\~13%
with CRS interference modeling
  * In scenario 3 sparse, the cell average UPT gain with 256QAM is 7\~30% with CRS interference modeling
  * For scenarios 2b sparse and scenario 3 with no more than 3 dB power back-off, the impact of power back-off on the system performance is limited
Note: the different evaluations between the sources for each scenario result
from different assumptions, such as Tx/Rx EVM and RU value. All the
evaluations have Tx/Rx EVM impairment as indicated by RAN4 , i.e, 3\~4% Tx
EVM, 1.5\~4% Rx EVM.
Supporting 256QAM has standards impacts on:
  * eNB Tx EVM and UE impairment in RAN4
  * CQI/MCS/TBS tables
  * Mechanism for the eNB to select and inform the UE whether the new CQI/MCS/TBS tables are used
> PUCCH and PDCCH/EPDCCH design if larger UCI/DCI payload size is used.
Conclusion on standards impacts:
  * Introduce new CQI/MCS entries if 256QAM is introduced
    * The size of CQI/MCS table is FFS
    * Higher layer signalling is used to configure CQI/MCS table and/or 256QAM
  * Introduce new TBS entries if 256QAM is introduced
Size of feedback field is 4 or 5 bits if 256QAM is introduced
Conclusion on downlink higher order modulation:
  * RAN1 finds DL higher order modulation, i.e. 256QAM is beneficial in evaluated indoor sparse small cell scenarios with low mobility
  * RAN1 recommends to support DL higher order modulation, i.e. 256QAM
## 5.2 Enhancements and overhead reduction for UE-specific reference signals
and control signalling
The channel characteristics of small cells that are relevant to the
enhancements considered in this clause include
  * Low frequency-selective fading channel with small delay spread.
  * In cases when the UE mobility is low, the time-selective fading is also low.
In this clause, the discussion is focused on the techniques of enhancements
and overhead reduction for UE-specific reference signals and control
signalling to better match the scheduling and feedback in time and/or
frequency to the channel characteristics of small cells. The techniques are in
both downlink and uplink based on existing channels and signals.
### 5.2.1 Overhead reduction of downlink UE-specific reference signal
The low frequency-selective and low time-selective fading provides the
possibility for overhead reduction of downlink UE-specific reference signal.
Evaluations on spectrum efficiency gain have been performed with the
assumptions shown in Annex A.3.\ The baseline downlink UE-specific reference
signal with port 7 and port 8 is shown in Figure 5.2.1-1 [5].\ The overhead
reduction is considered in the time and/or frequency domain.

Figure 5.2.1-1 Baseline downlink UE-specific reference signal with port 7 and
port 8
The evaluation results are summarized in Table 5.2.1-1 and Table 5.2.1-2.

Table 5.2.1-2 Observed spectrum efficiency gain
* * *
SINR Average gain 5dB 0.9% 20dB 2.4% 30dB 3.9%
* * *
The evaluation results show that:
  * Any gains from overhead reduction of downlink reference signal occur mainly at high SINR range.
  * Gain/loss is dependent on various factors including:
    * PRB bundling size
    * UE speed
    * Modulation scheme
    * Transmission rank
    * TX/RX impairments including EVM
  * Real interference modelling/estimation is important, especially for advanced receivers
Supporting the overhead reduction of downlink reference signal has the
following specification impacts:
  * The pattern design of the reduced reference signal
  * Signalling to inform the UE of using the reduced reference signal
A suitable mechanism by which the eNB can select the downlink reference signal
pattern would also need to be identified.
### 5.2.2 Overhead reduction of uplink UE-specific reference signal
The low frequency-selective and low time-selective fading channel in small
cells provides the possibility for overhead reduction of uplink UE-specific
reference signal.
Evaluations on spectrum efficiency gain have been performed with the
assumptions shown in Annex A.3.\ The baseline uplink UE-specific reference
signal is shown in Figure 5.2.2-1[5].\ The overhead reduction is considered in
the time and/or frequency domain, the main methods proposed being:
  * reduction of number of the reference signal symbols per subframe
  * reduction of number of subcarriers carrying the reference signal
{width="2.6847222222222222in" height="2.327777777777778in"}
Figure 5.2.2-1 Baseline uplink UE-specific reference signal
The evaluation results are summarized in Table 5.2.2-1 and Table 5.2.2-2 for
reduction of the number of reference signal symbols per subframe.
Table 5.2.2-1 SINR range in which the spectrum efficiency gain is observed
* * *
Source SINR range in which the gain is observed Source 1 >3dB Source 2 >0dB

* * *
Table 5.2.2-2 Observed spectrum efficiency gain
* * *
SINR Average gain 3dB 7.8% 10dB 8.7% 20dB 6.4%
* * *
It is observed from the evaluation that
  * Around 7% spectrum efficiency gains are observed with only 1 reference signal symbol per subframe at medium and high SINR range and low UE mobility
  * There is a large spread between the results of different sources.
Implementation issues also need to be considered, including PAPR/CM
consideration in case of reduction of number of subcarriers carrying the
reference signal.
If the method involves reduction of the number of reference signal symbols per
subframe, the impact on MU scheduling would need to be considered.
Supporting the overhead reduction of uplink reference signal may have the
following specification impacts:
  * The pattern design of the reduced reference signal
  * The mapping of the reduced reference signal in the case of reduction of number of subcarriers carrying the reference signal
  * Signalling to inform the UE of using the reduced reference signal
  * OCC design in case of reduction of the number of reference signal symbols per subframe
  * Group hopping design in case of reduction of the number of reference signal symbols per subframe
  * UCI mapping design
  * PUSCH RE mapping
A suitable mechanism by which the eNB can select the uplink reference signal
pattern would also need to be identified.
### 5.2.3 Enhancements of control signalling
#### 5.2.3.1 Multi-subframe scheduling and cross-subframe scheduling
Multi-subframe scheduling and cross-subframe scheduling have been considered
as possible control signalling overhead reduction techniques
  * There are diverse views on the usefulness and potential gains of these methods, and possibilities for achieving significant gains have not been identified
  * It has been noted that PDSCH transmission in OFDM symbol #0 is strongly related to realising possible downlink gains from these methods
  * These methods may facilitate the scheduling of PUSCH e.g. in ABSs.
Supporting multi-subframe and/or cross-subframe scheduling may have the
following specification impacts:
  * The timing between DL grant and PDSCH
  * The timing between UL grant and PUSCH, as well as the timing between PUSCH and PHICH
  * The maximum number of HARQ process and the corresponding UE soft buffer handling
  * The necessary DCI format
  * Signalling to configure multi-subframe/cross-subframe scheduling
  * HARQ-ACK resource allocation
  * Possible PDCCH/EPDCCH blinding decoding
  * Mechanism to override or interrupt a multi-subframe/cross-subframe scheduling assignment
#### 5.2.3.2 Transmission of PDSCH/ePDCCH in OFDM symbol #0
Transmission of PDSCH/EPDCCH in OFDM symbol #0 has been considered
  * A gain in PDSCH RE availability can be achieved by this method in subframes in which it can be performed, e.g. up to 5.5% in PDSCH PRB pairs in MBSFN subframes with 2 CRS ports configured and rank 1-2 transmission, or up to 6% in PDSCH PRB pairs in non-MBSFN subframes, with 2 CRS ports configured, with DMRS based transmission modes
  * The proportion of subframes in which this gain can be achieved is FFS.
  * There are diverse views on the complexity and potential gains of this method.
  * It is noted that reliable dynamic signalling for PDSCH starting in OFDM symbol #0 is only available using a mechanism similar to the PQI signalling introduced in TM10.
Supporting the PDSCH/EPDCCH from the first OFDM symbol may have the following
specification impacts:
  * Signalling to inform the UE of the PDSCH/EPDCCH starting symbol
  * Mechanism(s) to maintain backward compatibility
# 6 Mechanisms to ensure efficient operation of a small cell layer
## 6.1 Mechanisms for interference avoidance and coordination among small
cells
For each technique of interference avoidance and coordination, further study
includes the followings:
  * Feasible time scale (i.e., how fast or slow the technique is applied)
  * Performance analysis/gain
  * Necessary enhancements of mechanism and procedure, and additional measurements to help the network decision
  * Consideration on its potential impacts on other system performance, for example, coverage, increased handover and signalling, energy consumption, possible impact on IDLE mode UEs
Candidate techniques for study are listed in following subclauses, other
techniques are not precluded.
### 6.1.1 Small cell on/off
A small cell can also refer to a component carrier when more than one
component carrier is available.
This work continues under this Study, with the findings being taken later into
account in the NCT(New Carrier Type) Work Item.
#### 6.1.1.1 Small cell on/off schemes and performance gains
The following schemes are relevant to small cell on/off study:
1) Baseline schemes without any on/off
> In these schemes, the small cell is always on.
2) Long-term on/off schemes for energy saving
> In these schemes, the small cells may be turned on/off in large time scales.
> These schemes are studied in RAN3 Energy Saving SI/WI.
3) Semi-static on/off schemes
> In these schemes, the small cells may be turned on/off semi-statically. The
> descriptions of the schemes and their performance evaluations are included
> in 6.1.1.1.1.
4) Ideal, dynamic on/off schemes
> In these schemes, the small cells may be turned on/off in subframe level.
> The descriptions of the schemes and their performance evaluations are
> included in 6.1.1.1.2.
5) NCT with NCTCRS (i.e., reduced CRS)
> NCT with NCTCRS is studied in NCT WI. Small cell on/off developed in SCE can
> apply to NCT after it is introduced. Comparison NCTCRS and small cell on/off
> performance are included in 6.1.1.1.3.
##### 6.1.1.1.1 Semi-static small cell on/off schemes and performance gains
In these schemes, the small cells may be turned on/off semi-statically. The
criteria used for semi-static on/off may be the traffic load
increase/decrease, UE arrival/departure (i.e. UE-cell association), and packet
call arrival/completion. With legacy procedures, the feasible time scales of
semi-static on/off schemes are generally in the order of seconds to hundreds
of millisecond level; and with possible enhancements, the transitions may
reduce to tens of milliseconds if all UEs connected to the cell are at least
of Rel. 12.
a) Semi-static on/off scheme based on traffic load
In this case, a turned-off small cell may be turned on if the traffic load in
a neighbourhood of the cell (including the cell itself) increases to a certain
level. Conversely, a turned-on small cell may be turned off if the traffic
load in a neighbourhood of the cell decreases to a certain level.
The performance gains for semi-static on/off based on traffic load for
Scenario 2a with 10picos/macro are summarized in Table 6.1.1.1.1-1. Note that,
in this set of results, relative long on period is assumed and hence
transition time has no impact on average system performance.

a. Semi-static on/off based on traffic load can offer moderate gains (mainly
concentrated in the range of 5% to 27%) with low/medium small cell turning-off
ratio (â‰¤40% off of randomly selected small cells) and with low/medium traffic
load.
b. With high/very high small cell turning-off ratios (â‰¥50% off), the gains are
lower or vanish, especially with high traffic load. Loss was observed by some
companies.
  * With 6 MBSFN subframes configured as baseline:
a. A single contribution provides results for high/very high small cell
turning-off ratios (â‰¥50% off) which shows performance loss.
b) Semi-static on/off scheme based on UE-cell association
In this case, a turned-on small cell may be turned off if there is no UE
associated to it, and a turned-off small cell may be turned on if the network
decides a UE to be associated to it. The UE-cell association may be decided by
the network taking into account of UE measurements (e.g. mobility
measurements) and load balancing/shifting considerations.
The performance gains for semi-static on/off based on UE-cell association are
summarized in Table 6.1.1.1.1-2. Note that, in this set of results, relative
long on period is assumed and hence transition time has no impact on average
system performance.

* * *
It is observed from the evaluation results that
  * Semi-static on/off based on UE-cell association can offer moderate (\~10%) to large (>20%) gains with low/medium traffic load.
  * The large gains are observed in cases with sparse UE distributions.
  * Note that all results available for this scheme assume no MBSFN subframe configured.
c) Semi-static on/off scheme based on packet call arrival/completion, with
transition time modeled
In this case, a turned-off small cell may be turned on if a packet call
arrives and needs to be transmitted, and the cell may be turned off after the
packet call is completed. An off-to-on transition time and on-to-off
transition time are modeled. Various assumptions on small cell and UE
capabilities, status, protocols, etc., can affect the feasibility of the
considered time scales for on/off transitions.
The performance gains for semi-static on/off based on packet call
arrival/completion with transition times are summarized in Table 6.1.1.1.1-3A,
Table 6.1.1.1.1-3B, and Table 6.1.1.1.1-3C (for transition time â‰¤ 100ms) and
Table 6.1.1.1.1-4 (for transition time > 100ms). In the tables, "(x,y)" stands
for x ms off-to-on transition time and y ms on-to-off transition time.

call arrival/completion, with transition time â‰¤ 100ms and no cell ID planning

It is observed from the evaluation results that, for semi-static on/off based
on packet call arrival/completion with transition time shorter than 100ms,
  * With no cell ID planning and 0 MBSFN subframes configured
    * Large (>20%) gains in most results with low/medium traffic load. Many sources show very high gains (>40%).
      * For transition time in the range of [20ms, 50ms], very large gains are observed in most results.
      * For transition time in the range of [80ms, 100ms], large gains are observed though lower than in the case of [20ms, 50ms].
      * For transition time in the range of [10ms, 15ms], high to very high gains are observed.
  * With no cell ID planning and 6 MBSFN subframes configured
    * Moderate to large gains (mostly >10%) in most results with all traffic load in at least one of the performance metrics (mean/5%ile /50%ile/95%ile UPT gains). One source show losses in the only performance metric (mean UPT gain).
      * With high traffic load, the gains are reduced.
      * One source shows that with larger packet sizes, the gains are improved to become moderate and large (mostly 10% to 20%) with all traffic load.
      * One source with CRS-IC shows losses with high traffic load where performance loss of macro UEs is shown without clear reason.
  * With sector-aligned CRS shift and 0 MBSFN configuration
    * With 4 Picos/Cluster and the on/off transition no longer than 50ms: moderate (10%\~25%) 5%ile UPT gains, and low (5%\~15%) 50%ile UPT gains.
    * With 10 Picos/Cluster and the on/off transition no longer than 50ms: low (\ 100ms

It is observed from the evaluation results that for semi-static on/off based
on packet call arrival/completion with transition time longer than 100ms
  * Low or no gains or losses in most results, though moderate to large gains are also observed by some companies.
  * Note that gains are observed in some sets of results where off-to-on transition time is not included when calculating UPT.
Table 6.1.1.1.1-5 shows performance gains in the presence of legacy UEs which
could not use discovery signals for the measurement.

* * *
It is observed from the evaluation results from two sources that
  * The performance gain with semi-static on/off decreases as the percentage of legacy UEs increases due to performance loss in legacy UEs.
  * With no more than 40% legacy UEs, semi-static on/off provides low to large performance gains (3%\~37%).
  * With more than 50% legacy UEs, semi-static on/off may not provide performance benefit.
  * One source show that the performance loss with 50% legacy UEs can be remedied if on/off is restricted to cells without legacy UEs, in which case semi-static on/off provides low to moderate performance gains.
  * One source show that the performance loss with 60% legacy UEs can be remedied if on/off is restricted to only 60% of small cells, in which case semi-static on/off provides low to high performance gains.
##### 6.1.1.1.2 Ideal, dynamic small cell on/off schemes and performance gains
In these schemes, the small cells may be turned on/off in subframe level,
following criteria such as packet arrival/completion and the need for
interference coordination/avoidance in subframe time scales. In other words,
at the moment of a packet arrival, the small cell can be turned on immediately
and transmit the packet to a UE, and it can be turned off at the moment of the
completion of the packet. Likewise the small cell can be turned on/off
immediately based on the need for interference coordination/avoidance.
Clearly, these schemes cannot be supported at least according to current
standards, and they are studied in SCE SI to provide performance gain upper
bounds for on/off adaptation.
The performance gains for ideal, dynamic on/off based on packet
arrival/completion are summarized in Table 6.1.1.1.2-1 (with 0 MBSFN per radio
frame and no cell ID planning), Table 6.1.1.1.2-2 (with 0 MBSFN per radio
frame and cell ID planning ensuring aligned small cell CRS within cluster),
Table 6.1.1.1.2-3 (with 6 MBSFN per radio frame and no cell ID planning), and
Table 6.1.1.1.2-4 (with 6 MBSFN per radio frame and cell ID planning ensuring
aligned small cell CRS within cluster).

It is observed from the evaluation results on Rel.8 mechanism that
  * For the 1st best RSRP small cell, at least, almost all UEs within a cluster area can detect the best RSRP small cell by using 8 PSS/SSS samples.
  * The detection probabilities can be improved to a certain extent as the number of measurement samples for PSS/SSS increases.
  * Evaluation results differ substantially depending on the evaluation methodologies.

For further improvement of cell detection performance, some companies have
evaluated the PSS/SSS interference canceller (SS-IC)-based cell discovery
mechanism. Evaluation results on the small cell detection performance in SCE
scenario 2a with dense deployment for the top three small cells are summarized
in Table 6.2-2.

It is observed from the evaluation results on SS-IC-based mechanism that
  * The detection probabilities for the 2nd and 3rd best RSRP small cells can be improved significantly.
  * For the 3rd best RSRP small cell, some results (Sources 1 and 2) show that the detection probability is significantly lower than those for the 1st and 2nd best RSRP small cells especially the case of using only 1 PSS/SSS measurement sample; another result (Source 4) shows that the detection probability is virtually the same as for the 1st and 2nd best RSRP cell.
#### 6.2.1.3 Other RS-based mechanisms (with existing RS)
For further improvement of cell detection performance, some companies have
investigated the new cell discovery mechanism based on existing RS such as PRS
and CSI-RS.
Compared to PSS and SSS, PRS and CSI-RS have longer transmission periods in
general. To avoid the large UE effort on the timing search, it could be
considered that the eNB informs RRC_CONNECTED UE the rough timing of RSs for
the small cell discovery so that the UE can detect PRS or CSI-RS without the
large effort on the timing search.
Evaluation results on the small cell detection performance in SCE scenario 2a
with dense deployment for the top three small cells are summarized in Table
6.2-3.

It is observed from the evaluation results on the new mechanism based on
existing RS that
  * The detection probabilities for top three small cells can be improved significantly even if only 1 measurement sample is applied for the small cell discovery assuming more than 25 RBs and with +/- 3 microsecond or +/- 0.1 CP search window.
  * The detection probabilities for top three small cells based on CSI-RS can approach 0 with 1 measurement sample for the small cell discovery assuming 6 RBs and with +/- 5ms search window.
  * The muting mechanism such as ZP-CSI-RS can provide significant performance improvement, when the appropriate muting pattern is assigned to small cells within the same cluster assuming more than 25 RBs and with +/- 3 microsecond or +/- 0.1 CP search window.
#### 6.2.1.4 Modified SS/RS or new discovery signal-based mechanism
For further improvement of cell detection performance, some companies have
investigated the new cell discovery mechanism based on modified SS/RS or new
discovery signal such as PSS/SSS muting, Companion Discovery Signal (CDS)
based on the unused REs next to the existing PSS/SSS REs, and CRS with RE
muting.
Evaluation results on the small cell detection performance in SCE scenario 2a
with dense deployment are summarized in Table 6.2-4.

  * The CDS can provide significant performance improvements. The detection probabilities for the top 6 cells are over 90% even if only one measurement sample is applied.
#### 6.2.1.5 Evaluation on opportunistic activation and deactivation of small
cells based on UL signals
In evaluations, the existing UL signals are utilized as the discovery signal
by the dormant cell to detect proximity of active UEs. UL transmissions can be
utilized to trigger a cell to transition from a dormant state to start
transmission of DL-SS/RS.
Based on one source evaluation, if SRS SINR threshold is set to be 10dB in
scenario 1 defined in this TR, there are 80% UEs detected by the 1^st^
strongest neighbouring cell, 60% UEs detected by the 2^nd^ strongest
neighbouring cell and 40% UEs detected by the 3^rd^ strongest neighbouring
cell.
#### 6.2.1.6 Additional observation related to inter-frequency small cell
discovery
An interest in increasing the maximum number of measurement carriers without
significant increase of UE power consumption and/or measurement delay has been
expressed by some operators.
Power consumption is affected by many factors, one of which is the time UE
spends on inter-frequency measurements. In the evaluations in Tables 6.2.1,
6.2-2, 6.2-3 and 6.2-4, measurements with short period have been considered
and have been shown to provide good detection performance, if network
assistance (in Sec. 6.2.2.3) is assumed. However, other factors including UE
mobility, propagation delay, and measurement robustness have not been studied
in the evaluations.
### 6.2.2 Enhancements of small cell discovery
The following enhancements have been studied for achieving the benefits for
the small cell discovery.
#### 6.2.2.1 PSS/SSS interference cancellation
UE PSS/SSS IC can be utilized to enhance the performance of small cell
discovery, i.e., more small cells can be detected by removing the effects of
interference. It may not require a new standardised procedure and can be
achieved by defining new UE performance requirements.
#### 6.2.2.2 Burst transmission of DL-SS/RS
If small cell on/off mechanisms are supported (cf subclause 6.1.1), a small
cell in dormant state or DTX state transmits a DL-SS/RS burst with low duty
cycle.
  * As a DL-SS/RS burst, PSS/SSS/CRS, CSI-RS, PRS, modified SS/RS or new discovery signal can be considered.
  * At least, the legacy PSS/SSS/CRS can be transmitted from a small cell in active state as usual so that the legacy UE can detect and measure the active small cell.
Following benefits may be achieved by this solution.
  * For the DL-based small cell on/off mechanisms, a DL-SS/RS burst with long duty cycle may be transmitted by small cells in dormant state or DTX state so that the network would be able to make a quick decision on whether to activate the eNB or not based on the measurement report from RRC_CONNECTED UEs
  * A DL-SS/RS burst with long duty cycle can also provide additional help for UL-based small cell on/off mechanisms for small cells in dormant state or DTX state so that the network would be able to make a quick decision on whether to activate the eNB or not based on the measurement report from RRC_CONNECTED UEs.
  * For enabling small cell on/off (e.g., in absence of macro coverage), a DL-SS/RS burst with low duty cycle may be transmitted by small cells in dormant state so that an Idle UE would be able to know the cell may be available for connection later.
#### 6.2.2.3 Network synchronization and assistance
An eNB informs an RRC_CONNECTED UE the rough timing of the cluster so that the
UE can reduce the effort on cell detection, especially in the case of
synchronized transmission of SS/RS from small cells within the same cluster.
Although the synchronized transmission of SS/RS among small cells causes
severe interference regardless of the amount of traffic load, it can provide
several benefits as follows.
  * It can minimize the search window at UE by using network assistance, i.e., rough timing information of the synchronized transmission of SS/RS, so that the UE effort on small cell discovery is reduced.
  * It can maximize the detection performance gain of PSS/SSS-interference canceller, i.e., accurate cancellation based on synchronization and efficient interference mitigation among SS/RS signals.
In addition, an eNB may inform an RRC_CONNECTED UE the PCI-like information
and/or RS configuration information of candidate small cells in addition to
the timing information so that the UE can effectively detect SS/RS of multiple
small cells at the same time. This type of network assistance can also be
applied on top of the current cell detection mechanisms (i.e. PSS/SSS).
#### 6.2.2.4 New discovery mechanism
Following potential solutions to enhance the cell detection performance can be
considered if enhancement of cell detection performance is necessary.
  * Solution 1: Existing RS-based detection
    * Small cells at least within the same cluster transmit legacy PRS or CSI-RS with a coordination to avoid the collision between selected configurations.
    * Different nodes may need to inform each other about the selected configuration of PRS or CSI-RS.
    * If small cell on/off mechanisms are supported (cf subclause 6.1.1), small cells in active/dormant state transmit legacy PRS or CSI-RS burst with low duty cycle in addition to PSS/SSS/CRS in active state. Both active/dormant small cells within the same cluster synchronously transmit PRS or CSI-RS burst.
    * For this solution, a modification of any RS may not be > necessary. New detection and measurement mechanisms based on > PRS or CSI-RS should be specified. New measurement mechanisms > may require RE muting pattern modifications.
  * Solution 2: Modified SS/RS or new discovery signal-based detection
    * The eNB may inform an RRC_CONNECTED UE the configuration information of modified SS/RS or discovery signal in addition to the timing information so that the UE can effectively detect modified SS/RS or discovery signal of multiple small cells at the same time.
    * If small cell on/off mechanisms are supported (cf subclause 6.1.1), small cells in active/dormant state transmit modified SS/RS or new discovery signal with low density allocation of time/frequency resource in addition to PSS/SSS/CRS in active state.
    * The impact on legacy UEs, the increase of overhead, and the specification impact should be considered together with the achievable gain of this solution.
    * The impact on idle UEs in terms of cell detection and related power consumption would need further investigations.
    * Potential approaches include PSS/SSS muting, PSS/SSS sharing, double PSS/SSS, resource extension/densification, using the unused REs next to the legacy SS/RS, RE muting, and new discovery signal design.
Following benefits may be achieved by these solutions.
  * Allowing for robust detection/measurement performance even with synchronized transmission of DL-SS/RS within a single subframe, leading to more efficient inter-frequency measurement and robust intra-frequency mobility.
  * Since these solutions potentially achieves accurate detection of many surrounding small cells, various efficient operations in the small cell layer such as load balancing/shifting, CoMP/ICIC and efficient small cell on/off can be realized.
#### 6.2.2.5 Transmission of DL-SS/RS at specific carrier
If small cells operating at different carrier frequencies transmit DL-SS/RS at
a specific carrier frequency (e.g., one of the multiple small cell carriers or
the macro cell carrier), the UE effort for inter-frequency small cell
discovery may be relaxed.
#### 6.2.2.6 Relaxed RAN4 requirement
Relaxed RAN4 requirement can reduce the detection time at UE, but it increases
the detectable SINR target. This solution has been discussed in RAN2 WI of
Mobility enhancements in heterogeneous networks.
#### 6.2.2.7 Specification impacts
Supporting the efficient discovery mechanism based on some or all of above
solutions has the following potential specification impacts:
  * A DL-SS/RS burst transmission configuration for small cell on/off, e.g., new transmission period and duration of DL-SS/RS, if small cell on/off mechanisms are supported (cf subclause 6.1.1) and if network assistance to be introduced.
  * RRM measurement requirement and procedure considering the synchronized transmission of DL-SS/RSs and the network assistance (if it is introduced)
  * RRM measurement requirement and procedure considering the small cell on/off operation (if it is introduced)
  * Mechanism for the network assistance (if it is introduced)
  * For the solution 2 in subclause 6.2.2.4, the design of DL-SS/RS for small cell discovery (if it is introduced)
  * RAN4 requirement for UE SS/RS-IC (if it is introduced)
  * NW/UE support of cell discovery based on UL signals
### 6.2.3 Necessity of PCI extension
Larger cell planning effort to avoid PCI collision and PCI confusion in dense
deployments is seen as a potential motivation to enhance the small cell
discovery mechanism.
Evaluation results regarding the PCI collision problem are summarized in Table
6.2-4.
Table 6.2-4 Probability of PCI collision
+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------+---------+ | | PCI collision | | | | | threshold | | | | | | | | | | (note) | | | +-----------------------+-----------------------+---------+---------+ | | X=10 dB | X=15 dB | X=20 dB | +-----------------------+-----------------------+---------+---------+ | Source 1 | 0.007 | 0.012 | 0.017 | | | | | | | (504 PCIs, 500 | | | | | SCs/macro, uniform | | | | | distribution) | | | | +-----------------------+-----------------------+---------+---------+ | Source 2 | 0.006 | - | - | | | | | | | (504 PCIs, 40 | | | | | SCs/macro in 4 | | | | | clusters) | | | | +-----------------------+-----------------------+---------+---------+ | NOTE: PCI collision | | | | | is occurring if UE | | | | | receives a neighbour | | | | | cell DL signal with | | | | | the same PCI as | | | | | serving cell within X | | | | | dB difference | | | | | compared to the | | | | | serving cell DL | | | | | signal | | | | +-----------------------+-----------------------+---------+---------+
It is observed from the evaluation results that in terms of PCI collision,
assuming a completely random PCI allocation, the probability of PCI collision
is less than 2%.
For PCI confusion, the existing mechanism of reading the Cell Global
Identifier from SIB1 utilizing autonomous gaps is deemed sufficient. However,
it was also observed that SI reading may become more frequent in dense small
cell scenarios.
As a conclusion, the existing cell discovery signals are sufficient in terms
of number of individually identifiable cells. However, if standardization of
new discovery signals is considered necessary for other reasons, the number of
individually identifiable cells may be considered in the design.
### 6.2.4 Summary on small cell discovery
As a conclusion, enhancement of small cell discovery would be beneficial at
least when small cell on/off is supported. In addition, fast and efficient
discovery of small cells provides benefits for inter-frequency measurement.
Efficient small cell discovery procedures can be achieved by enhancing the
transmission and/or reception of existing SS/RS, including that of
PSS/SSS/CRS, CSI-RS, and PRS.
If new discovery mechanism is defined for small cell on/off, it may be used
for other purposes without further optimization.
## 6.3 Feasibility and benefits of radio-interface based synchronization
mechanisms
It is well known that TDD system needs inter-cell synchronization on the same
frequency or different frequencies within the same band; in addition, for both
TDD and FDD, it would be essential to consider the synchronization mechanisms
between cells to bring benefit to the existing features (e.g. (f)eICIC, CoMP
as well as carrier aggregation) and some potential techniques for small cell
enhancements (e.g. efficient small cell discovery). For some other techniques
such as advanced receiver at UE, a synchronized network is beneficial for the
receiver performance. It is thus observed that
Synchronization for both TDD and FDD systems needs to be considered.
Synchronization by GNSS or synchronization over backhaul network is not always
available for small cell deployments, e.g. indoor deployment, hotspots with
high buildings around. The additional cost brought by these two mechanisms is
also of concern, especially for small cells. Therefore it is beneficial to
have a radio-interface based synchronization mechanism when GNSS or backhaul
based synchronization are unavailable.
In small cell SI, the study on inter-cell synchronization focuses on the
following cases, with non-ideal backhaul on all interfaces
  * Synchronization between a small cell and the overlaid macro cell
  * Synchronization between small cells in the same cluster
  * Synchronization between small cell clusters
The target synchronization accuracy for the purpose of the study was \ In the network listening period when a target cell monitors the source cell,
> the target cell would stop the DL transmission to its own UEs at least when
> the target cell and the source cell are in the same frequency. For legacy
> UEs, the network listening period can be configured in MBSFN subframes, or
> configured in the GP (Guard Period) in TDD system [6].
>
> For initial acquisition and/or during off periods when the source cell is

>
> It is observed that MBSFN subframes cannot be configured if TDD UL-DL

#### 6.3.1.5 Resource overhead
> In the network listening periods, if the target cell stops the transmission

> level of seconds. It could be considered to allow the eNB to choose proper
> detection interval. For example, the eNBs with better clock stability can
> use a longer interval.
#### 6.3.1.6 Applicability/compatibility with the ongoing studies
Applicability/compatibility of synchronization approaches with other ongoing
studies need to be considered. Depending on their detailed design, the ongoing
studies to be considered may include NCT, small cell on/off and eIMTA.
#### 6.3.1.7 Support of inter-operator synchronization
Contiguous TDD spectrum allocation among different operators is available and
can be more popular in the higher frequency bands. Synchronization becomes
important among the cells of different TDD operators deployed in the same band
and same region, since the unsynchronized network will incur significant
mutual interference and degrade the network performance of both sides, e.g.,
when the transmit powers on the uplink and downlink are very different. In
case that the operators negotiate or exchange information about their
common/reference timing, inter-operator synchronization may be achieved by
appropriate synchronization requirements in RAN4.
Possible air-interface based approach considered to achieve inter-operator
synchronization:
Mutual network listening - With this approach, communication between the cells
of different operators is needed, such as the stratum level indication, RS
configuration and etc.
#### 6.3.1.8 Cost and complexity
With network listening, an additional receiver is needed at least for the FDD
eNB. An additional receiver in the baseband may also be needed for the TDD
eNB. There is no additional UE complexity needed for network listening.
#### 6.3.1.9 Standards impacts
To support network listening in small cell scenarios, the potential standards
impacts include
  * The indication of the synchronization stratum level
  * The maximum supported hop number
  * Improvement on the achievable synchronization accuracy by improving the channel condition of received network listening RS at the target cells
  * Mechanisms to reduce the resource overhead for network listening
  * Applicability/compatibility of synchronization approaches with other ongoing studies
  * Mechanisms to facilitate inter-operator synchronization
#### 6.3.1.10 Performance evaluation
Evaluations were carried out to investigate the achievable accuracy by network
listening, mainly based on the existing signals and designs. The evaluation
assumptions are shown in Annex A.4.3.
The link level evaluation results for each hop are summarized in Table 6.3-1
and Table 6.3-2. The system level evaluation results are summarized in Table
6.3-3 and Table 6.3-4.

### 6.3.2 UE-assisted synchronization
The synchronization between the source cell and the target cell can be
achieved by some information provided by or obtained from UEs.
The indication of stratum level is also needed when UE-assisted
synchronization is applied.
It is observed that the availability and selection of the UEs to assist
synchronization may impact the performance of the synchronization.
#### 6.3.2.1 Achievable synchronization accuracy
The achievable synchronization accuracy can be impacted by multiple factors,
including
  * Availability of UEs
  * Channel condition of the received signals at the selected UE side in the downlink, or at the eNB side in the uplink
  * The propagation delay difference between the source cell and the target cell at the UE side
    * Compensation of the propagation delay can be considered.
  * The time drift between measurements caused by frequency synchronization error
#### 6.3.2.2 Resource overhead
The resource overhead may include DL resource for triggering UE action, UL
resource for UEs to provide information or signal, backhaul resource between
source cell and target cell to exchange information etc.
#### 6.3.2.3 Applicability/compatibility with the ongoing studies
Applicability/compatibility of synchronization approaches with other ongoing
studies need to be considered. Depending on their detailed design, the ongoing
studies to be considered may include NCT, small cell on/off and eIMTA.
#### 6.3.2.4 Support of inter-operator synchronization
It is difficult for a UE to access the network of another operator. With UE-
assisted synchronization, inter-operator synchronization may be achieved by
appropriate synchronization requirements in RAN4, in case that the operators
negotiate or exchange information about their common/reference timing, as
discussed in 6.3.1.7.
#### 6.3.2.5 Standards impacts
To support UE-assisted synchronization, the potential standards impacts
include
  * Mechanisms of UE-assisted synchronization for
    * UEs to provide information to the network or transmit uplink signals for network to detect
    * eNBs to exchange information and for the target cell to adjust its timing
    * Possible measurements on UE and eNB sides including the propagation delays between the UE and both eNBs
  * The indication of the synchronization stratum level
  * The maximum supported hop number
  * Applicability/compatibility of synchronization approaches with other ongoing studies
  * Mechanisms to facilitate inter-operator synchronization
### 6.3.3 Summary
It is beneficial to support radio-interface based synchronization for cases
when other methods such as GNSS or synchronization over backhaul are not
available. Network listening solutions have been considered and evaluated.
It is observed that radio-interface based synchronization (network listening)
is feasible based on the existing signals for the scenarios defined in the
simulation assumptions according to the evaluation results as described in
Section 6.3.1.10.
  * Note that not all the following aspects are taken into account in the evaluations
    * Errors due to propagation delay
    * Frequency error
    * Implementation margin
Applicability/compatibility of synchronization approaches with other ongoing
studies should be considered.
To support network listening in small cell deployments, the following
potential standards impacts may need to be considered:
  * Depending on the scenarios, improvement on the achievable synchronization accuracy by improving the hearability of received network listening RS at the target cells
  * The indication of the synchronization stratum level of up to approximate 4-6 hops
For the deployment among the cells of different TDD operators deployed in the
same band and same region, mechanisms to facilitate inter-operator
synchronization should be considered.
# 7 Physical layer study for small cell enhancements higher-layer aspects
The definition and applicable scenarios for dual connectivity deployments are
described in [8]. In this section we describe the foreseen physical layer
impacts of dual connectivity.
From PHY layer point of view, a dual-connectivity-capable UE should be able to
directly transmit and receive signal to/from both MeNB and SeNB, either
simultaneously or in other manners. Depending on the detailed architecture,
dual connectivity may have impacts on the following aspects of L1 operation.
Details of these impacts would depend on factors such as:
  * whether the UE has the capability for simultaneous transmission
  * the level of synchronization and coordination between eNBs
Possible areas of L1 impact include:
  * For any UE supporting dual connectivity:
    * Support of separate UCI (e.g., carrying ACK/NACK and CSI feedback, etc) transmission for MeNB and SeNB cells.
      * How to handle SR needs to be further studied
    * Support of independent configurations for UL channels and signals (e.g., PUSCH, PUCCH, DM RS, SRS, etc) toward MeNB and SeNBs
    * If other mechanisms for handling of random access procedure, system information and/or paging reception other than what is supported for CA needs to be defined, e.g. possible support of monitoring CSS in a SeNB cell.
    * If any additional power control function including PHR other than what is used for CA (e.g. separate closed-loop and open-loop) needs to be supported.
  * In addition, for a UE with the capability of multiple downlink/multiple uplink reception/transmission in one subframe
    * If any additional power control setting/scaling including PHR and prioritization between UL channels targeting different cells other than what is supported for CA needs to be supported.
    * If UEs need to support wider range of time difference between TAGs, other than what is supported for CA.
    * If it is needed to support UEs without simultaneous PUCCH/PUS(C)CH capability
  * In addition, at least for a UE with the capability of multiple downlink reception and single uplink transmission in one subframe,
    * The design may impact UCI transmission mechanisms and timing, resource allocation of UCI, RF retuning gap, UE behavior when UL channel interaction occurs. Potential solutions of single Tx UEs (if supported) for further consideration may include but are not limited to:
> a) UCI for an eNB is transmitted in an UL resource of the eNB in a TDM
> fashion between eNBs.
>
> b) UCI for both eNBs is transmitted in an UL resource of one eNB.

# A.4 Evaluation assumptions for efficient operation
## A.4.1 Evaluation assumptions for discovery
  * The baseline is the discovery performance based on existing signals such as PSS/SSS/CRS.
  * The uniformly distributed small cells can be optionally used for the evaluation of discovery RS.
```{=html}
``` \- Metrics for evaluation:
    -   UE battery consumption for discovery
    -   Number of supportable individually identifiable small cells
        -   Baseline is current number of supported PCIDs
        -   Identify whether the current number is sufficient
    -   Number of detectable cells in the chosen scenarios
        -   Target set of detectable cells:
            -   Actual target set of detectable cells per carrier
                frequency should be determined based on gain achievable
                with, such as, interference coordination and load
                balancing.
            -   Proposals for target set definition:
                -   Alt.1: Small cells within RSRP gap = Y, Y=15 dB is
                    baseline at this stage.
                -   Alt.2: Top N small cells of a UE with RSRP \>= X,
                    N \>= 3 and X=-127 dBm are baseline at this stage.
        -   Target false alarm probability
            -   0.001 is used for initial evaluation purpose and it
                should not impact the RAN4 requirement design
            -   False alarm probability is defined as a detection
                probability of cells in the case of noise only input
            -   In the legacy mechanism, the conclusive false alarm
                probability in the PSS/SSS detection should satisfy the
                above target
        -   Detectability as defined in 36.133 for initial evaluation
    -   Probability of detecting a cell as a function of distance
    -   Detection time (e.g. taking into account ability to support
        small cell DTX operation / energy consumption)
    -   Ability to estimate the signal strength of a small cell
    -   Overhead
    -   Impact on legacy UEs
    -   Detection probabilities and RSRP measurement accuracies for at
        least top 3 small cells are evaluated
    -   Number of measurement samples, i.e., PSS/SSS/CRS subframes, used
        for the detection/measurement should be shown (at least 1
        subframe case should be evaluated)
  * Begin by evaluating performance of legacy mechanism (i.e. PSS/SSS/CRS)
  * If inadequacies are identified with the legacy mechanism, evaluate:
    * first, approaches based on modified SS/RS
    * second, approaches based on new discovery signal
  * Evaluation methodology:
    * Up to companies to decide between e.g.:
      * Alt.1:
        * Step-0:system level simulation to model the interference profile for link level simulation
        * Step-1: link level simulation to derive the performance curve (i.e., SINR -- detection probability) based on the interference profile derived by the Step-0 simulation
        * [FFS] Step-2: system level simulation based on LLS to SLS mapping
      * Alt.2: System level evaluation including link-level signal generation and detection
  * Scenario:
    * Scenario 2a with dense deployment of small cells
      * Baseline: 1 cluster per cell, 10 cells per cluster; other values can also be evaluated.
  * Other baseline assumptions:
    * UEs only within cluster region are considered for the evaluation
    * It is assumed that UE does not have any PCI information of surrounding small cells in the evaluation of legacy mechanism
    * Synchronized transmission of PSS/SSS/CRS with timing/frequency offsets is assumed
    * Full buffer traffic load is assumed for the discovery performance evaluation
    * +/- 3 Î¼s timing offset and +/- 0.1 ppm frequency offset among small cells are used
    * EPA multipath fading channel (3 km/h) is used
    * Actual detection/measurement algorithms should be implemented
