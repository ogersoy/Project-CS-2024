# 4 Background
This work item presents scenarios for 3 CC downlink intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation. Two CC carrier aggregation has been a successful
mechanism to provide additional bandwidth in some cases. However, there are
still market requirements which require even higher bandwidth. The next
logical step in carrier aggregation is to aggregate 3 CCs on the downlink.
This work item proposes 3 CC intra-band contiguous CA in Band 40. This work
item essentially adds a 3rd DL 10//20MHz component carrier. The number of
uplink CC is up to 2. The 3 CCs for UL is beyond of this WID.
The WID for this work item was approved at RAN#63, March 2014, in RP-140145
[2].

## 5.1 Operating bands and channel bandwidths
### 5.1.1 Channel bandwidths for CA
Table 5.1.2-1 defines the supported E-UTRA CA configurations and bandwidth
combination set for 3DL contiguous CA in Band 40. 20 MHz and 10 MHz component
carrier channel bandwidths are proposed to be supported for Band 40 carrier
aggregation.

## 5.2 Specific UE RF requirements
### 5.2.1 Reference sensitivity power level
For TDD mode, since the UE is not receiving while it is transmitting, the
uplink configuration will not affect the DL REFSENS requirement. Therefore, no
changes are needed for Band 40 REFSENS requirement to support 3DL CA.And the
uplink configuration is defined in table 5.2.1-1.
Table 5.2.1-1: Intra-band CA uplink configuration for reference sensitivity
CA configuration / CC combination / NRB_agg / Duplex mode |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
CA configuration | 100RB+25RB | 100RB+50RB | 75RB+75RB | 100RB+75RB | 100RB+100RB | Duplex Mode |  |  |  |  |

CA_40D |  |  | 100 | 50 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 100 | 100 | TDD  
NOTE 1: The carrier centre frequency of SCC in the UL operating band is configured closer to the DL operating band. NOTE 2: The transmitted power over both PCC and SCC shall be set to PUMAX as defined in subclause 6.2.5A. NOTE 3: The UL resource blocks in both PCC and SCC shall be confined within the transmission bandwidth configuration for the channel bandwidth (Table 5.6-1). NOTE 4: The UL resource blocks in PCC shall be located as close as possible to the downlink operating band, while the UL resource blocks in SCC shall be located as far as possible from the downlink operating band. NOTE 5: In case a CA configuration consists of CC channel bandwidths which are unequal in bandwidth the PCC channel bandwidth shall be the larger one for reference sensitivity test. NOTE 6: For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirement is verified with the largest number of [simultaneous] active uplink carriers supported by the UE. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
### 5.2.2 Maximum input level
The maximum input level for 3DL intra-band contiguous CA is defined to keep
the same receive spectral power density as single and dual carrier
requirement, so -20.2dBm (-25dBm per CC) is proposed for CA bandwidth class D.
Following table is proposed in TS 36.101

### 5.2.3 Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS)
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact on ACS when
the aggregated bandwidth is wider, the ACS requirements are scaled for the
number of component carriers. The relaxation can be revisited if the approach
of scaling up the wanted CC power according to increased BW is shown to be not
justified.

### 5.2.4 Blocking characteristics
### 5.2.4.1 In-band blocking
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact on in-band
blocking when the aggregated bandwidth is wider, the in-band blocking
requirements are scaled for the number of component carriers. The relaxation
can be revisited if the approach of scaling up the wanted CC power according
to increased BW is shown to be not justified.

### 5.2.6 Intermodulation characteristics
To account for the added difficulty of the baseband filter impact on
intermodulation response when the aggregated bandwidth is wider, the
intermodulation requirements are scaled for the number of component carriers.
The relaxation can be revisited if the approach of scaling up the wanted CC
power according to increased BW is shown to be not justified.

## 5.3 Specific BS RF requirements
The current requirements specified in TS 36.104 and TS 36.141 for BS capable
of multi-carrier and/or CA operation in contiguous spectrum in single band are
agnostic to the number of CC supported by the BS in intra-band contiguous CA
operation, and thus can be applied for 3-CC contiguous intra-band DL CA in
Band 40. Indeed Band 40 intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation for 3-DL and
2-DL CCs have already been supported in the BS specifications since Release
10. Hence no change in the BS specifications is required.

Same requirements were defined as for LTE_CA_Bx_By_Bz.
