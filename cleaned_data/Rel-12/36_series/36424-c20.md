# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
below apply. Terms and definitions not defined below can be found in TR 21.905
[1].
**Dual Connectivity** : Defined in TS 36.300 [8].
**E-RAB: D** efined in TS 36.401 [7].
**X2:** logical interface between two eNBs. Whilst logically representing a
point to point link between eNBs, the physical realisation need not be a point
to point link.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR
21.905 [1].

# 4 Data link layer
Any data link protocol that fulfils the requirements toward the upper layer
may be used.
# 5 X2 interface user plane protocol
## 5.1 General
The transport layer for data streams over X2 is an IP based Transport. The
following figure shows the transport protocol stacks over X2.
Figure 6.1: Transport network layer for data streams over X2
The GTP-U (TS 29.281 [2]) protocol over UDP over IP shall be supported as the
transport for data streams on the X2 interface. The data link layer is as
specified in clause 4.
There may be zero or one UL data stream and zero or one DL data stream per
E-RAB at the X2 interface.
\- The DL data stream is used for DL data forwarding from the source eNB to
the target eNB.
\- The UL data stream is used for UL data forwarding from the source eNB to
the target eNB.
Each data stream is carried on a dedicated transport bearer.
The identity of a transport bearer signalled in the RNL control plane consists
of the IP address and the TEID of the corresponding GTP tunnel, allocated by
the target eNB (see TS 29.281 [2]).
## 5.2 GTP-U
The GTP-U (TS 29.281 [2]) protocol shall be used over the X2 interface between
two eNBs.
## 5.3 UDP/IP
The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 [3]).
The UDP port number for GTP-U shall be as defined in TS 29.281 [2].
The eNBs over the X2 interface shall support fragmentation and assembly of GTP
packets at the IP layer.
The eNB shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 [5]) and/or IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 [6]).
There may be one or several IP addresses in the both eNBs. The packet
processing function in the source eNB shall send downstream packets of a given
**E-RAB** to the target eNB IP address (received in X2AP) associated to the DL
transport bearer of that particular **E-RAB**. The packet processing function
in the source eNB shall send upstream packets of a given **E-RAB** to the
target eNB IP address (received in X2AP) associated to the UL transport bearer
of that particular **E-RAB**.
The Transport Layer Address signalled in X2AP messages is a bit string of
either
a) 32 bits in case of IPv4 address according to IETF RFC 791 [6]; or
b) 128 bits in case of IPv6 address according to IETF RFC 2460 [5].
## 5.4 Diffserv code point marking
IP Differentiated Services code point marking (IETF RFC 2474 [4]) shall be
supported. The mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv code points
shall be configurable by O&M for based on QoS Class Identifier (QCI)/ Label
Characteristics and others E-UTRAN traffic parameters. Traffic categories are
implementation-specific and may be determined from the application parameters.
## 5.5 Dual Connectivity
For the SCG bearer option, user data forwarding may be performed. The
behaviour of the eNB from which user data is forwarded is the same as
specified for the "source eNB", the behaviour of the eNB to which user data is
forwarded is the same as specified for the "target eNB".
For the split bearer option
\- the GTP-U (TS 29.281 [2]) protocol over UDP over IP shall be supported as
the transport for the data stream of PDCP PDUs on the X2 interface. The GTP-U
PDU includes a RAN Container with flow control information as specified in TS
36.425 [9] which is carried in the GTP-U extension header. The transport
bearer is identified by the GTP-U TEID (TS 29.281 [2]) and the IP address of
the MeNB and SeNB respectively. There may be zero or one UL data stream and
there is one DL data stream per E-RAB at the X2 interface:
\- The DL data stream is used for DL data transmission from the MeNB to the
SeNB.
\- The UL data stream is used for UL data transmission from the SeNB to the
MeNB.
\- the packet processing function in the MeNB shall send downstream packets of
a given E-RAB to the SeNB IP address (received in X2AP) associated to the DL
transport bearer of that particular E-RAB. The packet processing function in
the SeNB shall send upstream packets of a given E-RAB to the MeNB IP address
(received in X2AP) associated to the UL transport bearer of that particular
E-RAB.
\- data forwarding may be performed by MeNB providing GTP-U TEID to receive
the DL data forwarded by the SeNB.
