# Introduction
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3GPP TSG SA to allow for
the standardisation in the area of lawful interception of telecommunications.
This document describes in general the architecture and functions for lawful
interception. Laws of individual nations and regional institutions (e.g.
European Union), and sometimes licensing and operating conditions define a
need to intercept telecommunications traffic and related information in modern
telecommunications systems. It has to be noted that lawful interception shall
always be done in accordance with the applicable national or regional laws and
technical regulations.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the architecture and functional requirements
within a Third Generation Mobile Communication System (3GMS) and the Evolved
Packet System (EPS).
The specification shows the service requirements from a Law Enforcement point
of view only. The aim of this document is to define a 3GMS and EPS
interception system that supports a number of regional interception
regulations, but these regulations are not repeated here as they vary.
Regional interception requirements shall be met in using specific (regional)
mediation functions allowing only required information to be transported.
The handover interfaces for Lawful Interception (LI) of Packet-Data Services,
Circuit Switched Services, and Multimedia Services within the UMTS network and
Evolved Packet System for Stage 3 are described in TS 33.108 [11].

and to non-CSG members. A H(e)NB configured for hybrid access does not
broadcast a CSG Indicator but does broadcast a CSG Identity.
**IP layer:** As defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 1122
[18]
**Interception Area:** is a subset of the network service area comprised of a
set of cells which defines a geographical zone.
**Location Dependent Interception:** is interception of a target mobile within
a network service area that is restricted to one or several Interception Areas
(IA).
**Open access mode:** H(e)NB operates as a normal NodeB or eNodeB. A H(e)NB
configured for open access does not broadcast either a CSG Indicator or CSG
Identity.

# 4 Functional architecture
The following figures contain the reference configuration for the lawful
interception. The circuit-switched configuration is shown in figure 1a. The
packet-switched configuration is shown in figure 1b. Intercept configurations
for HLR and IMS are shown in figures 1c and 1d. The WLAN interworking
configuration is shown in figure 1e. The intercept configurations for IMS
conferencing is shown in figure 1f. The CC intercept configuration for IMS-
based VoIP is shown in figure 1g.The various entities and interfaces are
described in more detail in the succeeding clauses. The additional intercept
configurations for Evolved 3GPP Packet Switching Domain are described in
clause 12.
NOTE 0: WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and
TS 29.234 [16]) are no longer maintained for Release 12 onwards. This clause
is therefore no longer maintained for WLAN Interworking.
PS domain of the UMTS system (GSN and Multimedia Packet Data services), 3GPP-
WLAN interworking network and Evolved Packet Switching Domain provide
UMTS/GSM/EPS customer\'s mobile equipment (UE) with connectivity service to
another end of the communication. Another end of the communication may be a
network element (server) or another UE. Therefore, UMTS/EPS system provides IP
layer TS 23.008 [15] services. Hence, UMTS/EPS NO/AP is responsible only for
IP layer interception of CC data. In addition to CC data, the LI solution for
UMTS/EPS offers generation of IRI records from respective control plane
(signalling) messages. The IP layer connectivity service is needed to support
application layer TS 29.234 [16] service provision to UMTS/GSM/EPS customers.
For instance, the following are examples of application layer services: email
service; web browsing service; FTP service; audio services (e.g. VoIP, PoC);
other multimedia services (MBMS, video telephony); The majority of the
application layer services require addition of respective server functionality
to the network. Note that it is not necessary that such application layer SP
should be the same commercial entity as the UMTS/EPS AP/NO in question.
When location information of the target is delivered by an ICE, the MF may
need to add the civic address associated with the access network point as
known by the CSP. The method used to obtain the civic address will depend on
the CSP implementation. (eg by accessing a remote database). National
regulations define whether the civic address needs to be provided.
NOTE 1: For instance in MBMS a BM-SC and especially content providing server
may be operated by different commercial entity than UMTS network.

The reference configuration is only a logical representation of the entities
involved in lawful interception and does not mandate separate physical
entities.
Regional Mediation Functions, which may be transparent or part of the
administration and delivery functions, are used to convert information on the
HI1, HI2 and HI3 interfaces in the format described in various national or
regional specifications. For example, if ETSI ES 201 671 [3] or ANSI J-STD-025
[8] is used, then the adaptation to HI1, HI2 and HI3 will be as defined in
those specifications.
There is one Administration Function (ADMF) in the network. Together with the
delivery functions it is used to hide from the 3G ICEs that there might be
multiple activations by different Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) on the same
target. The administration function may be partitioned to ensure separation of
the provisioning data from different agencies.
See the remaining clauses of this document for definitions of the X1_1, X1_2,
X1_3, X2 and X3 interfaces. These interfaces are specifically defined for LI
and are not related to other interfaces/reference points having the same name
specified in other 3GPP specifications (such as e.g. X2 interface specified in
the e-UTRAN architecture).
Interception at the Gateways is a national option. However, if 3G direct
tunnel functionality with the GGSN, as defined in TS 23.060 [10], is used in
the network, then the GGSN shall perform the interception of IRI and the
content of communications.
In figure 1a DF3 is responsible for two primary functions:
\- Call Control (Signalling) for the Content of Communication (CC); and
\- Bearer Transport for the CC.
HI3 is the interface towards the LEMF. It must be able to handle the
signalling and the bearer transport for CC.
In figures 1a, 1b, 1e, 1f and 1g, the HI2 and HI3-interfaces represent the
interfaces between the LEA and two delivery functions. The delivery functions
are used:
\- to distribute the Intercept Related Information (IRI) to the relevant
LEA(s) via HI2 (based on IAs, if defined);
\- to distribute the Content of Communication (CC) to the relevant LEA(s) via
HI3 (based on IAs, if defined).
In figures 1c and 1d the HI2 interface represents the interface between the
LEA and the delivery function. The delivery function is used to distribute the
Intercept Related Information (IRI) to the relevant LEA(s) via HI2.
Figure 1g shows the CC interception configuration for VoIP. The trigger for
the CC interception is provided by a SIP signalling node and identified within
the figures as CC Interception Triggering Function.
NOTE 2: With reference to figure 1c, CC interception does not apply to HLR.
NOTE 3: For IMS, figure 1d relates to the provision of IRI for SIP messages
handled by the CSCF. Interception of CC for this case can be done at the GSN
under a separate activation and invocation, according to the architecture in
Figure 1b (see also clause 7.A.1). For CC interception of VoIP, see figure 1g.
NOTE 4: If an operator is required to support \"HI1 notification over HI2\"
[11], the X1_2 interface may carry the information coming from the ADMF to the
DF2/MF that will be conveyed to the LEMF.
# 5 Activation, deactivation and interrogation
## 5.0 General
Figure 2 is an extraction from the reference intercept configuration shown in
figures 1a through to 1e which is relevant for activation, deactivation and
interrogation of the lawful interception.
Figure 2: Functional model for Lawful Interception activation, deactivation
and interrogation
In addition to the typical 3G ICEs functional entities, a new functional
entity is introduced - the ADMF - the Lawful Interception administration
function. The ADMF:
\- interfaces with all the LEAs that may require interception in the
intercepting network;
\- keeps the intercept activities of individual LEAs separate;
\- interfaces to the intercepting network.
Every physical 3G ICE is linked by its own X1_1-interface to the ADMF.
Consequently, every single 3G ICE performs interception (activation,
deactivation, interrogation as well as invocation) independently from other 3G
ICEs. The HI1-interface represents the interface between the requester of the
lawful interception and the Lawful administration function; it is included for
completeness, but is beyond the scope of standardisation in this document.
For VoIP CC Interception, the CC Interception Triggering Function and the CC
Intercept Function are treated as one 3G ICE from a Lawful Interception
administration perspective.
The target identities for 3GMS CS and PS interception at the SGSN, GGSN, 3G
MSC Server and 3G GMSC Server can be at least one of the following: IMSI,
MSISDN or IMEI.
NOTE 1: Some communication content during a mobility procedure may not be
intercepted when interception is based on MSISDN (only PS interception) or
IMEI. The use of the IMSI does not have this limitation. For the availability
of the target identities IMSI, MSISDN and IMEI (PS interception), refer to TS
23.060 [10].
The target identities for multi-media at the CSCF can be one or more of the
following: SIP URI, TEL URI, or IMEI. Other identities are not defined in this
release.
The target identities for 3GPP WLAN Interworking interception can be MSISDN,
IMSI or NAI. For the availability of the target identities in the I-WLAN nodes
(AAA server, PDG, WAG), refer to TS 23.234 [14], TS 23.008 [15], TS 29.234
[16] and TS 24.234 [17].
NOTE 2: The NAI may be a temporary ID, therefore the use of MSISDN or IMSI is
recommended.
> NOTE 3: Void
NOTE 3A: WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and
TS 29.234 [16]) are no longer maintained for Release 12 onwards. This clause
is therefore no longer maintained for WLAN Interworking.
The target identities for 3GPP HNB interception can be IMSI, MSISDN, IMEI, or
ME Id.
Use of the HNB ID or the CSG Identity as a target identity is FFS.
In the case of location dependent interception the following network/national
options exist:
\- target location versus Interception Areas (IAs) check in the 3G ICEs and
Delivery Functions (DFs);
\- target location versus IAs check in the DFs (physical collocation of the
DFs to the 3G ICEs may be required by national law);
\- location dependent interception is not applicable to CSCF.
NOTE 4: The IA is previously defined by a set of cells. From the location of
the target this set of cells permits to find the relevant IA.
NOTE 5: It is not required that the 3G GMSC or the 3G GGSN are used for
interception when Location Dependent Interception is invoked and the location
of the target is not available.
Editors\' note: Location dependent intercept for the 3G MSC Server is not
defined for this release.
The ADMF shall be able to provision P-CSCFs independently from S-CSCFs. If
both P-CSCFs and S-CSCFs are administered within the network for intercept,
redundant multi-media IRI may be presented to the agency as a result.
## 5.1 Activation
### 5.1.0 General
Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the information flow for the activation of Lawful
Interception.
### 5.1.1 X1_1-interface
The messages sent from the ADMF to the 3G ICEs (X1_1-interface) contain the:
\- target identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI, SIP URI or TEL URI, NAI) (see notes
4, 5, 6);
\- information whether the Content of Communication (CC) shall be provided
(see note 1);
\- address of Delivery Function 2 (DF2) for the intercept related information
(see note 2);
\- address of Delivery Function 3 (DF3) for the intercepted content of
communications (see note 3);
> \- IA in the case of location dependent interception.
NOTE 1: As an option, the filtering whether intercept content of
communications and/or intercept related information has to be provided can be
part of the delivery functions. (Note that intercept content of communications
options do not apply at the CSCF, HLR and AAA server). If the option is used,
the corresponding information can be omitted on the X1_1-interface, while
\"information not present\" means \"intercept content of communications and
related information has to be provided\" for the ICE. Furthermore the delivery
function which is not requested has to be \"pseudo-activated\", in order to
prevent error cases at invocation.
NOTE 2: As an option, only a single DF2 is used by and known to every 3G ICE.
In this case the address of DF2 can be omitted.
NOTE 3: As an option, only a single DF3 is used by and known to every 3G ICE
(except at the CSCFs, HLR and AAA server). In this case the address of DF3 can
be omitted.
NOTE 4: Since the IMEI is not available, interception based on IMEI is not
applicable at the 3G Gateway. Moreover, in case the IMEI is not available,
interception based on IMEI is not applicable at 3G ICEs.
NOTE 5: Interception at the CSCFs is based upon either SIP URI, TEL URI or
IMEI. SIP URI and TEL URI as target identities are not supported by the other
ICEs. The related CC interception also uses the SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI.
NOTE 6: Interception based on NAI is only applicable at AAA server, PDG, and
WAG. As the NAI could be encrypted or based on temporary identity at the PDG
and WAG, interception based on the NAI is not applicable in those cases in
these nodes.
NOTE 7: Void
If after activation subsequent Content of Communications (CC) or Intercept
Related Information (IRI) has to be activated (or deactivated) an \"activation
change request\" with the same identity of the target is to be sent.
Figure 3: Information flow on X1_1-interface for Lawful Interception
activation
Interception of a target can be activated on request from different LEAs and
each LEA may request interception via a different identity. In this case, each
target identity on which to intercept will need to be sent via separate
activation messages from ADMF to the 3G ICEs on the X1_1-interface. Each
activation can be for IRI only, or both CC and IRI.
When several LEAs request activation on the same identity and the ADMF
determines that there is an existing activation on the identity, the ADMF may
(as an implementation option) send additional activation message(s) to the 3G
ICEs. When the activation needs to change from IRI only to CC and IRI an
activation change message will be sent to the 3G ICEs.
In the case of a secondary interception activation only the relevant LEAs will
get the relevant IRIs.
### 5.1.2 X1_2-interface (IRI)
For the activation of IRI the message sent from the ADMF to the DF contains:
\- the target identity;
\- the address for delivery of IRI (= LEMF address);
\- which subset of information shall be delivered;
\- a DF2 activation identity, which uniquely identifies the activation for DF2
and is used for further interrogation or deactivation, respectively;
\- the IA in case of location dependent interception;
\- the warrant reference number if required by national option.
If a target is intercepted for several LEAs and/or several identities
simultaneously, a single activation of delivery is necessary for each
combination of LEA and identity.
Figure 4: Information flow on X1_2-interface for Lawful Interception
activation
### 5.1.3 X1_3-interface (CC)
For the activation of intercepted Content of Communications the message sent
from the ADMF to the Delivery Function contains:
\- the target identity;
\- the address of delivery for CC (= LEMF address);
\- a DF3 activation identity, which uniquely identifies the activation for DF3
and is used for further interrogation or deactivation, respectively;
\- the IA in case of location dependent interception;
\- the warrant reference number if required by national option.
If a target is intercepted by several LEAs and/or several identities
simultaneously, a single activation of delivery is necessary for each
combination of LEA and identity.
Figure 5: Information flow on X1_3-interface for Lawful Interception
activation
## 5.2 Deactivation
### 5.2.0 General
Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the information flow for the deactivation of the
Lawful interception.
### 5.2.1 X1_1-interface
The messages sent from the ADMF to the 3G ICEs for deactivation contain:
\- the target identity;
\- the possible relevant IAs in case of location dependent interception.
Figure 6: Information flow on X1_1-interface for Lawful Interception
deactivation
If interception of a target has been activated via different identities then a
separate deactivation message will need to be sent from the ADMF to the 3G
ICEs for each identity.
When several LEAs requested activation on the same identity and subsequently
request deactivation then the ADMF determines that there are remaining
activations on the identity. In this case, the ADMF will not send a
deactivation message to the 3G ICEs except when the activation needs to change
from CC and IRI to IRI only. In that case an activation change message will be
sent to the 3G ICEs.
### 5.2.2 X1_2-interface (IRI)
The message(s) sent from the ADMF to Delivery Function 2 for the deactivation
of the Intercept Related Information contains:
\- a DF2 activation ID, which uniquely identifies the activation to be
deactivated for DF2.
If a target is intercepted by several LEAs and/or several identities
simultaneously, a single deactivation is necessary for each combination of LEA
and identity.
Figure 7: Information flow on X1_2-interface for Lawful Interception
deactivation
### 5.2.3 X1_3-interface (CC)
For deactivating the delivery of the CC the message(s) sent from the ADMF to
DF3 contains:
\- a DF3 activation ID, which uniquely identifies the activation to be
deactivated for DF3.
Figure 8: Information flow on X1_3-interface for Lawful Interception
deactivation
## 5.3 Interrogation
### 5.3.0 General
Interrogation provides the current status of the interception activation in
the system. Interrogation of all activations for a given LEA is an ADMF
function.
### 5.3.1 Interrogation of the 3G ICEs
Figure 9 shows the information flow for the interrogation of the Lawful
Interception. It shall be possible to interrogate:
\- a specific activation at each relevant 3G ICEs;
\- all activations at each relevant 3G ICEs.
As a result of the interrogation the activation status and data are returned.
Figure 9: Interrogation of the Lawful Interception (3G ICEs)
### 5.3.2 Interrogation of Delivery Functions
Figure 10 shows the information flow for the interrogation of the Lawful
Interception. It shall be possible to interrogate:
\- a specific activation at a DF;
\- all activations at a DF for a given target identity;
\- all activations at a DF.
As a result of the interrogation the activation status and data are returned.

# 6 Invocation of Lawful Interception for Circuit Switched Services
## 6.0 General
Figure 11 shows an extraction from the reference configuration in figure 1a
which is relevant for the invocation of the lawful interception.
{width="3.8027777777777776in" height="2.845138888888889in"}
Figure 11: Functional model for Lawful Interception invocation
The HI2 and HI3 interfaces represent the interfaces between the LEMF and two
delivery functions. Both interfaces are subject to national requirements. They
are included for completeness, but are beyond the scope of standardization in
this document. The delivery functions are used:
\- to convert the information on the X2-interface to the corresponding
information on the HI2-interface;
\- to convert the information on the X3-interface to the corresponding
information on the HI3-interface;
\- to distribute the intercept related information to the relevant LEA(s)
(based on IAs, if defined);
\- to distribute the intercept content of communicationsto the relevant LEA(s)
(based on IAs, if defined).
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the 3G MSC Server provides a correlation
number and target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is used to select the
different LEAs to which the product shall be delivered.
NOTE: If interception has been activated for both parties of the call both CC
and IRI will be delivered for each party as separate intercept activity.
The Mc interface between the 3G MSC Server and MGW is used to establish
intercept and deliver the bearer to DF3.
For Location Dependent Interception, the location dependency check occurs at
the establishment of each call. Subsequent dependency checks for simultaneous
calls are not required, but can be a national option.
If a target is marked using an IA in the 3G MSC Server, the 3G MSC Server
shall perform a location dependency check at call set-up. Only if the
target\'s location matches the IA then the call is intercepted.
If a target is marked using an IA in the DF2, the DF2 shall perform a location
dependency check at reception of the first IRI for the call. Only if the
target\'s location matches the IA for certain LEAs is IRI the relayed to these
LEAs. All subsequent IRIs for the call are sent to the same LEAs.
If a target is marked using an IA in the DF3, the DF3 signalling function
shall perform a location dependency check at reception of the CC. Only if the
target\'s location matches the IA for certain LEAs is the CC relayed to these
LEAs.
## 6.1 Provision of Intercept CC - Circuit Switched
Figure 12 shows the access method for the delivering of CC. The access method
shall be a bridged/ T-connection.
Figure 12: Delivery configuration to the LEMF for the interception of a
circuit switched call
The signals of both parties of the configuration to be intercepted are
delivered separately to the LEMF. The delivery function has no impact on the
connection between the subscribers.
The two stublines towards the LEMF are established in parallel to the call set
up. For both stublines the address is used which has been provided during
activation.
Bearer, and only bearer, is sent from the MGW to the bearer function of DF3.
NOTE 1: For data calls it is necessary to provide means for fast call
establishment towards the LEMF to help ensure that the beginning of the data
transmission is delivered.
The following information needs to be transferred from the 3G MSC Server to
the DF3 in order to allow the DF3 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity (MSISDN, IMSI or IMEI); note 2
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception. note 2
\- correlation number (IRI \ CC);
\- direction indication - (Signal from target or signal to target).
NOTE 2: For DF3 internal use only.
Additional information may be provided if required by national laws.
## 6.2 Provision of CC - Short Message Service
Figure 14 shows an SMS transfer from the 3G MSC Server to the LEMF. Quasi-
parallel to the delivery from / to the mobile subscriber a message, which
contains the contents of the SMS with the header, is generated and sent via
the Delivery Function 2 to the LEMF in the same way as the Intercept Related
Information.
The IRI will be delivered to the LEMF:
\- for a SMS-MO. Dependent on national requirements, delivery shall occur
either when the 3G MSC receives the SMS from the target MS, or when the 3G MSC
receives notification that the SMS-Centre successfully received the SMS;
\- for a SMS-MT. Dependent on national requirements, delivery shall occur
either when the 3G MSC receives the SMS from the SMSC, or when the 3G MSC
receives notification that the target MS successfully received the SMS.
Figure 14: Provision of Content of Communication - Short Message Service
## 6.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 6.3.0 General
Intercept Related Information (Events) are necessary at the Begin and End of
the call, for all supplementary services during a call and for information
which is not call associated. There are call related events and non call
related events.
Figure 15 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If
an event for / from a mobile subscriber occurs, the 3G MSC Server sends the
relevant data to the DF2.
Figure 15: Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 6.3.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the 3G MSC Server to
the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity (MSISDN, IMSI or IMEI);
\- in case of location dependent interception, the IAs and/or target cell ID
shall be provided;
\- events and associated parameters as defined in clauses 6.3.3 and 6.3.4 may
be provided.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 with a reliable transport mechanism.
### 6.3.2 Structure of the events
The information sent to DF2 is triggered by up to eight different call related
and non-call related events. Details are described in following clause. The
events for interception are configurable (if they are sent to DF2) in the 3G
MSC Server and can be suppressed in the DF2. The events are listed as follows:
Call Related Events:
\- Call Establishment
\- Answer
\- Supplementary Service
\- Handover
\- Release
Non Call Related Events:
\- SMS
\- Location Update
\- Subscriber Controlled Input
Table 1 below shows the set of information that can be associated with the
events. The events trigger the transmission of the information from the 3G MSC
Server to DF2. Available IEs from this set of information can be extended in
the 3G MSC Server, if this is necessary in a specific country. DF2 can extend
available information if this is necessary in a specific country e.g. a unique
number for each surveillance warrant.

## 6.4 Intercept cases for circuit switched supplementary services
### 6.4.1 Interception of Multiparty call
{width="5.000694444444444in" height="3.7604166666666665in"}
Figure 16: Interception of Multiparty for CC
Figure 16 shows the delivery of CC from intercepted multiparty call where
party A is the target of interception.
One pair of call content channels are delivered to the delivery function.
Party A is delivered to the DF3 on one channel and the sum of the balance of
the parties, B,C and D is delivered on the second channel.
It should be noted that if parties B,C or D is a target of interception, that
intercept is treated as a simple call intercept.
The events contain information about B, C and D if subscriber A is monitored.
If one of B, C or D is monitored, events contain the information about A but
not the other parties of the conference.
### 6.4.2 Interception for Call Forwarding / Call Deflection / ECT
{width="3.7402777777777776in" height="2.2597222222222224in"}
Figure 17: Interception for Call Forwarding / Deflection / ECT
The interception of party B once the supplementary service is invoked is a
national option.
For Intercept Related Information it depends who is monitored:
\- If subscriber A is monitored the number of A and B are mandatory in the
event information and the number of C if available.
\- If subscriber B is monitored the number of B and C are mandatory in the
event information and the number of A if available.
\- If subscriber C is monitored the number of C is mandatory in the event
information and the number of A and B if available.
Intercept requirements for CS multi-media is not defined in this release.
# 7 Invocation of Lawful Interception for GSN Packet Data services
## 7.0 General
Figure 18 shows the extract from the reference configuration which is relevant
for the invocation of the Lawful Interception of the packet data GSN network.
Figure 18: Functional model for Packet Data GSN Network Lawful Interception
invocation
The HI2 and HI3 interfaces represent the interfaces between the LEA and two
delivery functions. Both interfaces are subject to national requirements. They
are included for completeness, but are beyond the scope of this specification.
The delivery functions are used:
\- to convert the information on the X2-interface to the corresponding
information on the HI2 interface;
\- to distribute the intercept related information to the relevant LEA(s);
\- to distribute the intercept product to the relevant LEA(s).
For the delivery of the CC and IRI the 3G SGSN and/or, per national option 3G
GGSN provides correlation number and target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which
is used there in order to select the different LEAs where the product shall be
delivered. When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW through the S4 interface
([10], see also note 3), the SGSN is not required to provide CC for that
communication (see note 4).
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is used to correlate CC
with IRI and the different IRI\'s of one PDP context.
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related
to the PDP context.
When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW through the S4 interface ([10], see
also note 3), the SGSN is not required to provide IRIs for PDP contexts
associated with CC and correlation for that communication (see note 4).
NOTE 1: If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data
communication both CC and IRI will be delivered for each party as separate
intercept activity.
In case of location dependent interception:
\- for each target, the location dependency check occurs at each Packet Data
session establishment or release and at each Routing Area (RA) update to
determine permanently the relevant IAs (and deduce, the possible LEAs within
these IAs);
\- concerning the IRI:
\- when an IA is left, either a Mobile Station Detach event is sent when
changing servicing 3G GSNs, or an RA update event is sent;
\- RA update event is sent to DF2 when changing IAs inside the same servicing
3G SGSN;
\- when a new IA is entered a RA update event is sent to DF2 and, optionally,
a \"Start of interception with PDP context active\" event for each PDP
context;
\- concerning the CC, when crossing IAs, the CC is not sent anymore to the DF3
of the old IA but sent to the DF3 of the new IA.
Both in case of location dependent and location independent interception:
\"Start of interception with PDP context active\" event is sent by the new
SGSN if an Inter-SGSN RA update procedure, which involves different PLMNs,
takes place for a target, which has at least one active PDP context.
NOTE 2: An SGSN can differentiate \"Inter PLMN\" type of Inter-SGSN RA update
procedure from \"Intra PLMN\" type of Inter-SGSN RA update procedure by
inspecting the old RAI parameter, which is being received by the SGSN as part
of the procedure (see TS 23.060 [10], clause 6.9.1.2.2 and TS 23.003, clause
4.2).
Optionally, it is possible to send \"Start of interception with PDP context
active\" for all cases of inter- SGSN RA update when at least one PDP context
is active.
NOTE 3: S4 is an intra-PLMN reference point between the SGSN and the S-GW.
NOTE 4: When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW through the S4 interface, the
S-GW provides IRI, CC and correlation for the EPS bearer associated to the PDP
context, as specified in clause 12.
## 7.1 Provision of Intercept Product - Short Message Service
Figure 19 shows an SMS transfer from the 3G SGSN node to the LEA. Quasi-
parallel to the delivery from / to the mobile subscriber a SMS event, which
contains the content and header of the SMS, is generated and sent via the
Delivery Function 2 to the LEA in the same way as the Intercept Related
Information. National regulations and warrant type determine if a SMS event
shall contain only SMS header, or SMS header and SMS content.
The IRI will be delivered to the LEA:
\- for a SMS-MO. Dependent on national requirements, delivery shall occur
either when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from the target MS or when the 3G
SGSN receives notification that the SMS-Centre successfully received the SMS;
\- for a SMS-MT. Dependent on national requirements, delivery shall occur
either when the 3G SGSN receives the SMS from the SMS-Centre or when the 3G
SGSN receives notification that the target MS successfully received the SMS.
Figure 19: Provision of Intercept Product - Short Message Service
## 7.2 Provision of Intercepted Content of Communications -- Packet data GSN
services
### 7.2.0 General
The access method for the delivering of Packet Data GSN Intercept Product is
based on duplication of packets without modification at 3G GSN. The duplicated
packets with additional information in a header, as described in 7.2.1, are
sent to DF3 for further delivery to the LEA.
Figure 20: Configuration for interception of Packet Data GSN product data
### 7.2.1 X3-interface
In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following
information needs to be transferred from the 3G GSN to the DF3 in order to
allow the DF3 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity;
\- correlation number;
\- time stamp - optional;
\- direction (indicates whether T-PDU is MO or MT) - optional;
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception.
As a national option, in the case where the 3G GGSN is performing interception
of the content of communications, the target is handed off to another SGSN and
the same 3G GGSN continues to handle the content of communications subject to
roaming agreements, the 3G GGSN shall continue to perform the interception of
the content of communication.
If 3G direct tunnel functionality with the GGSN, as defined in TS 23.060 [10],
is used in the network, then the GGSN shall perform the interception of the
content of communications.
## 7.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 7.3.0 General
Intercept Related Information (Events) are necessary at the Mobile Station
Attach, Mobile Station Detach, PDP Context Activation, Start of intercept with
PDP context active, PDP Context Deactivation, RA update, Serving System,
Packet Header Information Reporting, and SMS events.
Serving System event reporting is a national option
Packet Header Information Reporting is a national option.
Figure 21 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If
an event for / from a mobile subscriber occurs, the 3G GSN or the Home
Location Register (HLR) sends the relevant data to the DF2. For Packet Header
Information Reporting, a 3G GSN either isolates the relevant data and sends it
to the DF2 or sends the packet stream to another entity in the network (e.g.,
DF3) for isolation which then provides the relevant data to the DF2.
See clause 7A for multi-media Intercept Related Information produced at the
CSCF.
Figure 21: Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 7.3.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the 3G GSN or the HLR
to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI);
\- events and associated parameters as defined in clauses 7.3.2 and 7.4 may be
provided;
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception;
\- Correlation number;
\- Quality of Service (QoS) identifier;
\- Encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC),
if available and necessary.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
The 3G GSN detects packets containing packet header information in the
communications path but the information needed for Packet Header Information
Reporting may need to be transferred from the 3G GSN either directly to the
DF2 or via another entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its
functionality.
### 7.3.2 Structure of the events
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2
if this is required. Details are described in the following clause. The events
for interception are configurable (if they are sent to DF2) in the 3G GSN or
the HLR and can be suppressed in the DF2.
**The following events are applicable to 3G SGSN:**
\- Mobile Station Attach;
\- Mobile Station Detach;
\- PDP context activation;
\- Start of interception with mobile station attached (national option);
\- Start of intercept with PDP context active;
\- PDP context modification;
\- PDP context deactivation;
\- RA update;
\- SMS;
\- Packet Header Information Reporting.
NOTE: 3G GGSN interception is a national option. Location information may not
be available in this case. [If interception is performed at the 3G GGSN, then
Packet Header Information Reporting shall also be performed at the 3G GGSN and
not at the 3G SGSN.]{.underline}
If 3G direct tunnel functionality with the GGSN, as defined in TS 23.060 [10],
is used in the network, then both the SGSN and the GGSN shall perform the
interception of intercept related information.
When the SGSN connects an UE to a S-GW through the S4 interface ([10]), the
SGSN is not required to report events PDP context activation (successful),
Start of intercept with PDP context active, PDP context modification, PDP
context deactivation; the SGSN shall report unsuccessful PDP context
activation event.
**The following events are applicable to the 3G GGSN:**
\- PDP context activation;
\- PDP context modification;
\- PDP context deactivation;
\- Start of interception with PDP context active ,
\- Packet Header Information Reporting.
**The following events are applicable to the HLR:**
\- Serving System.
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events
trigger the transmission of the information from 3G GSN or HLR to DF2, perhaps
via a MF in the case of Packet Header Information Reporting. Available IEs
from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the 3G GSN or HLR,
if this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available
information if this is necessary as a national option e.g. a unique number for
each surveillance warrant.

### 7.4.11 Packet Header Information Reporting
#### 7.4.11.0 Introduction
Packet Header Information Reporting can be done either on a per-packet (i.e.,
non-summarized) basis or in a summary report.
#### 7.4.11.1 Packet Data Header Report
This event is used to provide packet header reports on a per packet basis
(non-summarized reporting) and is triggered by each packet sent or received by
the target. These elements will be delivered either directly to DF2 or via
another network entity if available:
* * *
Observed MSISDN Observed IMSI Observed IMEI PDP address of observed party
Event Type Event Time Event Date Correlation Number Access Point Name PDP Type
Network Element Identifier Source IP Address Source Port Number Destination IP
Address Destination Port Number Transport Protocol (e.g., TCP) Packet Size
Flow Label (IPv6 only)
* * *
#### 7.4.11.2 Packet Data Summary Report
This event is used to report:
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers,
including:
a) source and destination IP Addresses,
b) IP next-layer protocol,
c) Layer-4 ports, and
d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or
received by the target for each unique packet flow within a PDP context, and
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that
packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 6-tuple of source/destination IP
address/port number and the layer 4 protocol, and PDP Context.
> IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always reported, the flow
> label is reported if the packet is IPv6, and the layer-4 ports are reported.
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique packet data session
(PDP context) and packet flow, and is triggered by one of the following:
\- start of a packet flow associated with a PDP Context
\- an interim report for a packet flow associated with a PDP Context is to be
reported
\- end of a packet flow associated with a PDP Context (including end of the
PDP Context itself).
An interim report can be triggered by
\- The expiration of a configurable timer per intercept (called a Summary
Timer). The Summary Timer is configurable in units of seconds;
\- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached;
These elements will be delivered either directly to DF2 or via an MF for each
packet flow if available:
* * *
Observed MSISDN Observed IMSI Observed IMEI PDP address of observed party
Event Type Event Time Event Date Correlation Number Access Point Name PDP Type
Network Element Identifier Source IP Address Source Port Number Destination IP
Address Destination Port Number Transport Protocol (e.g., TCP) Flow Label
(IPv6 only) Summary Period Packet Count (for this summary period) Sum of
Packet Sizes (for this summary period)
* * *
If the packets are IPv4, the sum of all observed packet sizes is the sum of
the values contained in the Total Length field of each packet as specified in
IETF RFC 791[39].
If the packet is IPv6, the sum of all observed packet sizes is the sum of the
values contained in the Payload Length field for each packet as specified in
IETF RFC 2460 [40].
If no packets were detected for the duration of the Summary Timer, then the
Packet Data Summary Report shall not be sent.
## 7.5 Void
## 7.6 Interception of the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)
The Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a service running over the 3GPP PS-
domain. Both mobile originating and mobile terminating MMS messages must pass
through PS domain GSN nodes en route to or from Multimedia Message Service
Centres (MMSCs). Therefore, interception of MMS messages shall be performed at
the GSN in exactly the same way as for other PS-domain bearer services.
The GSN is not responsible for recovering individual MMS messages from the
user PDP context IP stream.
No MMS specific HI2 records are defined to be delivered to the LEMF over the
DF2 other than those listed in clause 7.4 of this specification. CC records
shall be sent to the LEMF over the DF3 as specified in clause 7.3.
Interception of a user PDP context IP stream will occur as described in clause
7.2. Such a stream may or may not contain MMS messages.
# 7A Invocation of Lawful Interception for Packet Data Multi-media Service
## 7A.1 Provision of content of communications
Interception of the content of communications for GSN packet data services is
explained in clause 7.2.. Activation and invocation of lawful interception for
multi-media service only at the CSCF(s) does not produce interception of
content of communications. Consequently, a separate activation and invocation
of lawful interception must occur at a node that has access to the CC (e.g.,
in case of GPRS / UMTS (PS domain) interception of CC occurs at the GSN).
Interception at the GSN is only possible for a basic call. For the
interception of content of communications of IMS-based voice services
including CC for forwarded and transferred calls, refer to clause 15.
### 7A.1.A Decryption for IMS Media Plane Security
This clause describes how the TSP can meet the national requirements in Clause
5.1.2 of TS 33.106 [7] to deliver intercepted communications decrypted when
the TSP uses [25] IMS Media Plane Security options. If an ICE, in TSP IMS
network using Security options [25], allows interception of Content of
Communication in clear then this clause does not apply.
If Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams
(SDES) is used, the DF2 shall identify the SDES keys from the SDP offer and
SDP answer messages and provide the DF3 with the necessary SDES related
parameters. In this case, the DF3 shall perform the decryption prior to
delivery to the LEMF. For the CC delivered to the LEMF in a decrypted form,
the DF2 shall remove the SDES keys when present from the SDP offer and SDP
answer messages sent to the LEMF over HI2. The interface between the DF2 and
DF3 to support the transfer of session keys is outside the scope of this
specification.
When SDES is used in end-to-access edge mode, the P-CSCF shall intercept SDES
keys from SDP messages and shall deliver them to the DF2.
If a Key Management Service (KMS) and Multimedia Internet KEYing ticket
(MIKEY-TICKET) is used, the TSP may use the mechanism as defined in Clause
7A.7.1, which results in the DF2 receiving the sessions keys needed to decrypt
the intercepted communications. Clause 7A.7.1 defines that the DF2 delivers
the keys to the LEMF as IRI in order for the LEMF to decrypt the intercepted
traffic.
If the network is to decrypt the content of communications prior to delivery
to the LEMF via HI3, the DF2 shall provide the DF3 with the sessions keys as
defined in Clause 7A.7.1 instead of to the LEMF. In this case, the DF3 shall
perform the decryption prior to delivery to the LEMF. The interface between
the DF2 and DF3 to support the transfer of session keys is outside the scope
of this specification.
## 7A.2 Provision of IRI
### 7A.2.1 Provision of IRI with SIP messaging
SIP messaging is reported as Intercept Related Information for the
interception of multi-media service. As shown in figure 22 below, all SIP
messages executed on behalf of a target are subject to intercept at the S-CSCF
and Optionally P-CSCF. Based upon network configuration, the ADMF shall
provision P-CSCFs, or S-CSCFs, or both P-CSCFs and S-CSCFs with SIP URI, TEL
URI, or IMEI target identifiers. These resulting intercepted SIP messages
shall be sent to DF2 for mediation prior to transmittal across the HI2
interface. The enhanced P-CSCF (eP-CSCF) shall adhere to all LI requirements
pertaining to the P-CSCF. Any additional LI requirements pertaining to the
support of WebRTC Interworking, as specified in TS 23.228 [43], that only
apply to the eP-CSCF are described distinctly.
WebRTC Web Server Function (WWSF), if provided by the CSP, is an ICE that is
used to copy and transmit via the DF to the LEMF the IP address and port used
by the target as viewed by the WWSF. This IP address may be a public or
private address depending on how the target accesses the WWSF.
WebRTC Authorisation Function (WAF), if provided by the CSP, is an ICE that
creates a time-stamped authentication event associated with the target
including relevant information such as the user's identity provided to the
WAF.
Further details of the WWSF and WAF are FFS.
Editor's Note: The text in this clause related to the WWSF and WAF need to be
moved to a more appropriate part of this specification.
For roaming scenarios, interception at the P-CSCF shall be Mandatory, in order
to provide IRI Interception in the visited network, where the P-CSCF is
located in the Visited Network. Where the P-CSCF is located in the Home
Network, interception at the P-CSCF shall be Optional, subject to national
regulation.
Figure 22: Provision of Intercept Related Information for multi-media
### 7A.2.2 Provision of IRI with XCAP messages
The AS that store the XCAP data of the target shall intercept and transmit to
the DF2 any XCAP based messages related to actions by the target, related to
the supplementary service and other target's service settings, defined in 3GPP
TS 24.623 [55]:
\- on the Ut interface,
\- on other interface to any AS with XCAP server capability that uses XCAP
protocol.
The DF2 will encapsulate the information as an IRI to the LEMF.
NOTE: The XCAP services separation through XCAP filtering or the application
of Operator Policy function for national regulation is outside of the scope of
this specification as an implementation issue.
Every successful or unsuccessful IMS supplementary services setting
modification management request and response between UEs and IMS service
nodes, or from other access to the target's XCAP servers shall be reported. In
case of IRI only, any filtering of XCAP messages based on operator policy or
national regulation is for further studies.
NOTE: Report of events related to target's XCAP data and resources access by
non XCAP protocol are for further studies.
## 7A.3 Multi-media events
### 7A.3.0 General
\- All SIP messages to or from a target, and all SIP messages executed on
behalf of a target for multi-media session control are intercepted by the
S-CSCF and Optionally P-CSCF and sent to DF2. The target identifier used to
trigger the intercept will also be sent with the SIP message. This standard
does not require nor prohibit redundant information from being reported to
DF2.
\- Where a CSCF which provides lawful interception makes changes to a SIP
message, sent to or from or executed on behalf of a target then the CSCF shall
report both the original message and the modified message to the DF2.
\- Where a CSCF which provides lawful interception changes identities within a
SIP message (eg IMPI/IMPU changes or due to call forwarding etc) and the new
identity is the target, then both the original and modified SIP messages shall
be reported to DF2.
\- Where a CSCF which provides lawful interception changes identities within a
SIP message (eg IMPI/IMPU changes or due to call forwarding etc) and the new
identity is not the target, then both the original and modified SIP messages
shall be reported to DF2.
\- P-CSCF event reports may be redundant with S-CSCF event reports when the
P-CSCF and S-CSCF reside in the same network, however, this standard does not
require nor prohibit redundant information from being reported to DF2.
\- The IRI should be sent to DF2 with a reliable transport mechanism.
\- Correlation for SIP to bearer shall be supported within the domain of one
provider.
\- An intercepted SIP event sent to DF2 is shown below:
\- Observed SIP URI
\- Observed TEL URI
\- Observed IMEI
\- Event Time and Date
\- Network element identifier
\- SIP Message Header
\- SIP Message Payload
NOTE: The Observed IMEI is obtained from the +sip.instance.id of the
intercepted SIP message (as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [49]).- All IMS XCAP
messages to or from a target for multi-media or supplementary services are
intercepted by the AS, or the group of AS in charge to transmit, manipulate
and store any IMS XCAP of that target. The data have to be transmitted either
"en clair" or encrypted with all elements to let the LEMF decrypt the data.
The generated IRI should be sent in any case to DF2.
Editor's note:The data related to XCAP management and the XCAP documents
modification of the target, as supplementary services, or as the 3GPP or OMA
presence services (3GPP TS 24 141, OMA Presence SIMPLE specification and IETF
RFC 4827), have to be reported through the DF2. However, these are points for
further studies: 1) other data (XCAP management and the XCAP documents
modification by the target) to be transmitted but related to other multimedia
services; 2) the case of XCAP messages that are based on different interfaces
than Ut interface; 3) the specific architecture related to encrypted data; 4)
Detailed XCAP events, related to authentication.
\- An intercepted XCAP report sent to DF2 is shown below:
\- Observed SIP URI or Tel URI, based on XUI (described in IETF RFC 4825 [56])
or information in the XCAP payload (if available)
\- Observed XUI or any other identities (if available)
\- Event Time and Date
\- Network element identifier
\- XCAP Message (the entire elements of the HTTP Header and the XCAP payload),
NOTE: The interpretation of XCAP messages, such as HTTP request through the Ut
interface between the targets's UE and related XCAP server may sometime be
insufficient to let the LEA to understand what was modified as directed by the
UE a later HTTP response is needed to understand the success or failure of the
request.
### 7A.3.1 Mid IMS Session Interception
#### 7A.3.1.0 General
Mid IMS Session interception functionality applies in addition to other IMS LI
functional requirements as defined in section 7A.
Where LI is activated on a target within a CSCF after an IMS session has
already been established the CSCF shall do one of the following;
\- Where the CSCF has stored the media session information which occurred
prior to the interception activiation, the CSCF shall provide a "start of
interception with IMS session" event message, to the DF2/MF over the X2
interface, including the parameter and information listed in table 7A.3.1, if
available.
\- Where the CSCF has not stored media session information which occurred
prior to the interception activation, the CSCF shall report all future SIP
messages which the CSCF is able to identify as associated with an ongoing
target session. In this case, the event "start of interception with IMS
session" is not applicable.
It is a national option whether the CSCF shall be mandated to store the
necessary information to support reporting of session establishment
parameters, in order to support mid IMS session interception, or whether the
CSCF shall only report SIP messages which occur after the interception is
applied and the CSCF is able to identify as related to an ongoing target
session. If information is stored then it shall be possible to set a maximum
storage time according to national and/or operator requirements.
Table 7A.3.1 Start of interception with established IMS session event
* * *
Observed SIP URI Observed TEL URL Observed IMEI Event type Event Time Event
Date Network Element Identifier SIP message header offer (NOTE) SIP message
header answer (NOTE) SDP offer SDP answer Correlation information
* * *
NOTE: The SIP messages that carry the SDP offer and answer shall be reported.
In case there are multiple SDP offers/answers during the session
establishment, the SIP messages that carry the latest SDP offer/answer shall
be provided.
#### 7A.3.1.1 SDES Media Security
If an SDES crypto attribute is included in the SDP, the DF2/MF forwards the
"start of interception with IMS session" event message to the LEMF over HI2
without additional key processing.
NOTE: The SDES Crypto attribute contains the cryptographic key required for
decrypting the encrypted IMS media.
If SDES mid session support is required then storing of media information as
per 7A.3.1 is mandatory.
## 7A.4 Multi-media Call State Control Service Scenarios
Annex C shows examples of the delivery of intercepted events and product under
various call scenarios.
## 7A.5 Push to talk over Cellular (PoC)
PoC is a service of the IMS Domain and interception is done according the
definitions in clause 7A.3. Interception of CC is available with the current
implementations in the GSNs.
## 7A.6 SMS over IMS
SMS over IMS shall be intercepted in accordance with normal IMS interception
as described in 7A.3. SMS IRI (including originating and destination
addresses, SMS direction, and SMS Centre Address) are reported, if available,
for IRI-only intercepts.
## 7A.7 LI for KMS based IMS Media Security
### 7A.7.1 LI Architecture and functions
KMS based IMS media security is specified in [25]. The present clause
specifies LI architecture and functions needed to provide session encryption
keys generated by the KMS to protect IMS media for a subscriber who is a
target for interception in the IMS nodes. This section is applicable to the
cases in which the KMS is under responsibility of the Operator providing the
IMS network infrastructure. Other scenarios such as the one in which the KMS
is run by an independent legal entity are outside the scope of this
specification.
NOTE 1: It is FFS whether the Xk interface defined in this section can be used
also by the LEMF to directly query the KMS as an additional option.
NOTE 2: This section covers the scenario in which encrypted content of
communication is provided to the LEMF together with encryption keys, to allow
decryption at LEMF.
Figure 7A.7.1 shows the LI architecture for the case in which decryption is
performed by the LEMF and a KMS is used to support IMS media security, with a
Xk interface defined between the DF2/MF and the KMS, in addition to the
interfaces and functional entities needed to support LI in the P-CSCF/S-CSCF.
Figure 7A.7.1: KMS Intercept configuration
When LI has been activated in the P/S-CSCF for a target, the node will report
SIP messages events on the X2 interface, as specified in section 7.A and
subsections. The DF2/MF shall extract from the intercepted SIP signaling the
information related to the encryption and send a request over the Xk interface
to the KMS to derive the encryption keys; the request will carry also the
reference to the ticket transferred by the SIP signalling between the parties
involved in the communication. The KMS shall then, based on the information
received from the DF2, resolve the ticket and provide the session keys to the
DF2/MF over the Xk interface.
### 7A.7.2 Signalling over the Xk interfaces and LI events
The following messages are defined over the Xk interface:
  * get_keys
  * get_keys_response
The message get_keys shall be sent by the DF2/MF to the KMS in order to ask
the KMS to provide session keys for an ongoing communication.
The message get_keys_response shall be sent by the KMS to the DF2/MF in order
to provide the session keys.
The message get_key_response defines a LI event provided by the KMS to the
DF2/MF which shall then be sent by the DF2/MF to the LEMF in a proper IRI
record over the HI2 interface.
Table 7A.7.2.1 provides the list of parameters, which shall be carried by the
message get_keys, in order to transfer to the KMS the information, as
specified in [25], needed to provide the session encryption keys:
Table 7A.7.2.1 Parameters and information in message get_keys
* * *
Public KMS Identity of the target user TRANSFER_INIT TRANSFER_RESP
* * *
Upon reception of get_keys message, the KMS shall verify that the key
management information is related to the targeted user.
A timer may be defined in the DF2/MF in order to specify the amount of time
that the DF2/MF shall wait for the response from the KMS. If this timer
expires, a failure indication shall be sent to the LEMF.
Table 7A.7.2.2 provides the list of parameters, which shall be carried by the
message get_keys_response, in order to provide the DF2/MF with the session
keys:
Table 7A.7.2.2 Parameters and information in message get_keys_response
* * *
Crypto Session ID Session key Salt Failure indication (optional)
* * *
With reference to table 7A.7.2.2, in case of failure in providing any of the
decryption information, the KMS may provide a decryption failure indication.
Upon reception of get_keys_response message or in case of timer expiry, the
following information shall be provided to the LEMF by the DF2/MF:
\- Lawful interception identifier
\- Observed target identity(ies)
\- Correlation number (in order to correlate the keys to IMS session under
interception at the CSCF(s))
\- Event type (session encryption keys available)
\- Crypto Session ID (if provided by the KMS)
\- Session key (if provided by the KMS)
\- Salt (if provided by the KMS)
\- MediaSec key retrieval failure indication (in case of e.g. timer expiry, or
failure indication received from the KMS).
### 7A.7.3 Cooperating KMSs
As specified in [25], in some scenarios the parties involved in an encrypted
IMS based communication may use two different KMSs. In these cases, no
additional LI specific signalling between the KMSs shall take place. The KMS
may need to cache the session keys retrieved as result of the ticket
resolution for possible LI needs at later stage.
### 7A.7.4 Security
Xk interface and its configuration shall only be accessible to authorized
personnel.
The Xk interface shall have strong integrity and confidentiality protection.
The Xk interface shall be protected by TLS unless protected by IPsec for LI
purposes. TLS and certificate profiling shall be according to TS 33.310 [28];
IPsec profiling shall be according to TS 33.310 [28] and TS 33.210 [29].
### 7A.7.5 Start of interception for an already established IMS media secured
session
This function is invoked when LI is activated in the network for a target who
has already established an IMS session with secure media.
In order to provide information needed to decrypt the content of
communication, the LI function in the CSCFs needs to have access to SDP
information and SIP headers exchanged in the SIP signalling between the
parties during the IMS session setup for possible later retrieval in case LI
is activated during the ongoing session.
With reference to fig. 7A.7.1, if LI is activated by the ADMF over the X1_1
interface for a target, the CSCF shall check if the given target has an
ongoing IMS media secured session. In this case, the CSCF shall provide a
"Start of interception with established IMS session" event message to the
DF2/MF over the X2 interface, as specified in section 7A.3.1.
Upon reception of Start of interception with established IMS secure session
event, the DF2/MF shall check if a MIKEY-TICKET is included in the SDP. In
this case the DF2/MF, in addition to forwarding the event to the LEMF over
HI2, shall contact the KMS to resolve the ticket and retrieve the session keys
and additional encryption related information as specified in in section
7A.7.2.
## 7A.8 IMS IMEI Interception
The use of Instance ID in TS 24.229[49] is mandatory in IMS in order to
support IMEI based LI in the CSCF. The CSCF is required to have access to the
Instance IDs for all active IMS registrations regardless of whether LI has
been requested prior to UE registration for a given IMEI. The CSCF shall be
responsible for extracting the IMEI from the Instance ID where required for a
specific target interception and providing the IMEI to the DF2. The IMEI (when
available) shall be provided by the CSCF to the DF2 for all intercepted
communication regardless of whether the IMEI or another identifier has been
used as the target for interception.
Based on the national regulations, IMEI-based LI shall be possible for IMS
sessions originated from, or terminated to, the UE with that IMEI.
# 8 Security
## 8.0 General
The security requirements are valid for the whole Lawful Interception system,
i.e. rules and procedures shall be used for all involved entities, 3G GSN and
the DF.
## 8.1 Administration security
The administration of the LI function, i.e. Activation, Deactivation and
Interrogation of Lawful Interception, in the 3G ICEs and the DFs shall be done
securely as described below:
\- It shall be possible to configure the authorised user access within the
serving network to Activate, Deactivate and Interrogate Lawful Interception
separately for every physical or logical port at the 3G ICEs and DF. It shall
be possible to password protect user access.
\- Only the ADMF is allowed to have access to the LI functionality in the 3G
ICEs and DF.
\- The communication links between ADMF, 3G GSN,3G MSC Server, CSCF, DF2, and
DF3 may be required by national option to support security mechanisms. Options
for security mechanisms include:
\- CUG / VPN;
\- COLP;
\- CLIP;
\- authentication;
\- encryption.
Through the use of user access restrictions, no unauthorised network entities
or remote equipment shall be able to view or manipulate LI data in the 3G GSN,
3G MSC Server, CSCF or the DFs.
## 8.2 IRI security
### 8.2.1 Normal operation
The transmission of the IRI shall be done in a secure manner.
When DFs are physically separate from the 3G ICEs, the X2-interface may be
required by national option to support security mechanisms. Options for
security mechanisms include:
\- CUG/VPN;
\- COLP;
\- CLIP;
\- authentication;
\- encryption.
### 8.2.2 Communication failure
Depending on the national law in case of communication failure IRI may be
buffered in the 3G INEs. After successful transmission of IRI the whole buffer
shall be deleted. It shall be possible to delete the content buffer via
command or a timer, in an un-restorable fashion.
## 8.3 CC security
The transmission of the CC shall be done in a secure manner.
When DFs are physically separate from the 3G INEs, the X3-interface may be
required by national option to support security mechanisms. Options for
security mechanisms include:
\- CUG/VPN;
\- COLP;
\- CLIP;
\- authentication;
\- encryption.
In case of transmission failure no buffering is required within the
intercepting network.
## 8.4 Security aspects of Lawful Interception billing
Billing information may be suppressed or made available at the DFs and the
ADMF. Billing information for Lawful Interception shall be separated from
\"regular\" billing data.
Billing data transmission to the Lawful Interception billing system may be
done in a secure manner per national option.
In case of transmission failure billing-data shall be buffered/stored in a
secure way. After successful transmission billing data shall be deleted in an
un-restorable fashion.
## 8.5 Other security issues
### 8.5.1 Log files
Log files shall be generated by the ADMF, DF2, DF3, 3G MSC Server, CSCF and
the 3G GSN. All log files are retrievable by the ADMF, and are maintained by
the ADMF in a secure manner.
### 8.5.2 Data consistency
The administration function in the 3GMS shall be capable of performing a
periodic consistency check to ensure that the target list of target identities
in all involved 3G MSC Servers, CSCFs, 3G GSNs in the 3GMS and the DFs contain
the appropriate target Ids consistent with the intercept orders in the ADMF.
The reference data base is the ADMF data base.
# 9 Invocation of Lawful Interception for 3GPP WLAN Interworking Services
## 9.0 General
WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and TS 29.234
[16]) are no longer maintained for Release 12 onwards.
This clause 9 is therefore no longer maintained.
Figure 23 shows the extract from the reference configuration which is relevant
for the invocation of the Lawful Interception of the packet data 3GPP WLAN
Interworking network.
Figure 23: Functional model for invocation of Lawful Interception for 3GPP
WLAN Interworking Services
The HI2 and HI3 interfaces represent the interfaces between the LEA and two
delivery functions. Both interfaces are subject to national requirements. They
are included for completeness, but are beyond the scope of this specification.
The delivery functions are used:
\- to convert the information on the X2-interface to the corresponding
information on the HI2 interface;
\- to distribute the intercept related information to the relevant LEA(s);
\- to distribute the intercept product to the relevant LEA(s).
Interception at a WAG applies for the roaming users where the PDG is not in
the visited network.
For most WLAN Interworking cases, the Packet Data Gateway (PDG) handles the
bearer level interception, specifically interception of CC and IRI related to
tunnel establishment and release in which case there is no need to perform
interception at a WAG. This includes the case where the PDG is in the
intercepting carrier's network (whether it be home or visited). For the case
where a visited network is to intercept WLAN related tunnel and the PDG for
the tunnel is not in the visited network, the Wireless Access Gateway (WAG) is
used to intercept the CC and IRI related to tunnel establishment and release.
It should be noted that the CC available at the WAG may be encrypted.
## 9.1 Provision of Intercept Product - Short Message Service
LI for SMS in the 3GPP-WLAN Interworking case is described in Clause 7A.4.
## 9.2 Provision of Intercepted Content of Communications - 3GPP WLAN
Interworking services
### 9.2.0 General
The access method for the delivering of 3GPP WLAN Interworking Intercept
Product is based on duplication of packets without modification at the PDG or
WAG. The duplicated packets with additional information in the header, as
described in the following sections, are sent to DF3 for further delivery.
Note that CC available at the WAG is likely to be encrypted.
Figure 24: Configuration for interception of 3GPP WLAN Interworking product
data
### 9.2.1 X3-interface
In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following
information needs to be transferred from the PDG or WAG to the DF3 in order to
allow the DF3 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity;
\- correlation number;
\- time stamp - optional;
\- direction (indicates whether T-PDU is MO or MT) - optional;
\- the target location (if available in the intercepting node).
## 9.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 9.3.0 General
Figure 25 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If
an event for / from a mobile subscriber occurs, the PDG, WAG, or the AAA
Server sends the relevant data to the DF2. Packet Header Information Reporting
is a national option. For Packet Header Information Reporting, a PDG/WAG
either isolates the relevant data and sends it to the DF2 or sends the packet
stream to another entity in the network (e.g., DF3) for isolation which then
provides the relevant data to the DF2.
Figure 25: Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 9.3.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the PDG, WAG or the AAA
server to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity (IMSI, NAI, or MSISDN);
\- events and associated parameters as defined in section 9.3.2 may be
provided;
\- the target location (if available);
\- Correlation number;
\- Quality of Service (QoS) identifier (if available).
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
The PDG/WAG detects packets containing packet header information in the
communications path but the information needed for Packet Header Information
Reporting may need to be transferred from the PDG/WAG either directly to the
DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its
functionality.
### 9.3.2 3GPP WLAN Interworking LI Events and Event Information
The following events are applicable to AAA Server:
\- I-WLAN Access Initiation;
\- I-WLAN re-authentication,
\- I-WLAN Access Termination;
\- I-WLAN Tunnel Establishment;
\- I-WLAN Tunnel Disconnect;
\- Start of Intercept with I-WLAN Communication Active;
The following events are applicable to the PDG and WAG:
\- I-WLAN Tunnel Establishment;
\- I-WLAN Tunnel Disconnect;
\- Start of Intercept with I-WLAN Communication Active.
\- Packet Header Information Reporting.
A set of possible elements as shown below is used to generate the events.
Information associated with the events are transmitted from the PDG, WAG or
AAA server to DF2.
NOTE: Some of these parameters apply to the PDG or WAG and some apply to the
AAA server. Parameters sent from the PDG, WAG or AAA server is dependent on
what is available at the network element. If interception is performed at the
PDG, then Packet Header Information Reporting shall also be performed at the
PDG and not at the WAG.

### 9.4.6 Packet Header Information Reporting
#### 9.4.6.0 Introduction
Packet Header Information Reporting can be done either on a per-packet (i.e.,
non-summarized) basis or in a summary report.
#### 9.4.6.1 Packet Data Header Report
This event is used to provide packet header reports on a per packet basis
(non-summarized reporting) and is triggered by each packet sent or received by
the target. These elements will be delivered either directly to DF2 or via
another network entity if available:

#### 9.4.6.2 Packet Data Summary Report
This event is used to report:
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers,
including:
a) source and destination IP Addresses,
b) IP next-layer protocol,
c) Layer-4 ports, and
d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or
received by the target for each unique packet flow within a WLAN tunnel, and
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that
packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 6-tuple of source/destination IP
address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and WLAN tunnel.
> IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always reported, the flow
> label is reported if the packet is IPv6, and the layer-4 ports are reported.
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique packet data session
(PDP context) and packet flow, and is triggered by one of the following:
\- start of a packet flow associated with a WLAN Tunnel
\- an interim report for a packet flow associated with a WLAN Tunnel is to be
reported
\- end of a packet flow associated with a WLAN Tunnel (including end of the
WLAN Tunnel itself).
An interim report can be triggered by
\- The expiration of a configurable timer per intercept (called a Summary
Timer). The Summary Timer is configurable in units of seconds;
\- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached.
These elements will be delivered either directly to DF2 or via an MF for each
packet flow if available:

# 10 Interception of Multimedia Broadcast/MultiCast Service (MBMS)
## 10.0 General
MBMS provides video or similar streamed services via either point to point
multicast or cell broadcast mechanisms between an operator content server (BM-
SC) and UEs as defined in TS 23.246 [20]. This section details the stage 2
Lawful Interception requirements for MBMS.
NOTE: Generic Broadcast services where the UE receives the broadcast in IDLE
mode and there is no subscription relationship between the UE and the BM-SC
are out of scope. In addition 3^rd^ party BM-SC services where the operator is
not responsible for content encryption and subscription management are out of
scope.
Figure 10.1 shows the extract from the reference configuration which is
relevant for the invocation of the Lawful Interception of the MBMS Services.
Figure 10.1: Functional model for invocation of Lawful Interception for MBMS
Services
## 10.1 Provision of Content of Communications
Interception of the content of communications for MBMS services if available,
may be provided by the underlying transport bearer interception functionality
(e.g. GSN, PDG or NGN network) and is therefore subject to the current
transport bearer interception functionality detailed in other parts of this
specification.
## 10.2 Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 10.2.0 General
Figure 10.2 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If
an event for / from a mobile subscriber occurs, the BM-SC shall send the
relevant data to the DF2.

### 10.2.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the BM-SC to the DF2 in
order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity;
\- events and associated parameters as defined in clauses 10.3.2 may be
provided;
\- For Further Study:- Encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters
for decrypting CC), if available and necessary.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.

# 11 IMS Conference Services
## 11.1 Background for IMS Conference Services
The entire clause 11 is a national option and is subject to national
regulations. The covered cases are where the conference services are in the
domain of the intercepting operator. The following cases are covered.
  1. A target's conference call is the target. This may be where the target is the head of the conference. IRI and CC for this conference is reported. The following are examples of information that is reported.
a. For example, the starting and ending of a conference as well as any parties
joined or removed from the conference call are reported.
b. Reporting of CC for held conferences initiated by the target.
  2. A conference that itself is directly the target of interception. This case is applicable only provided that the conference is identified by a proper identity for LI in IMS domain (Conference URI or Conference Factory URI). The IRI and CC for this conference is reported.
a. For example, the starting and ending or a conference as well as any parties
joined or removed from the conference call are reported.
The case when an target joins an associate's conference is for further study.
The key elements for interception of conference services are the AS/MRFC and
MRFP. IRI associated with the conference services that are to be intercepted
is reported by the AS/MRFC while the CC associated with the conference service
is reported by the MRFP.
## 11.1A Start of Interception for IMS Conference Services
Interception (as defined in 11.1) for IMS Conference Services is started when
the first of any one of the following occurs:
\- When a target requests that a conference be created
\- When a target successfully provisions a conference
\- When a target provisioned or requested conference is started (i.e., the
first party is joined to the conference)
\- When a conference that is a target of interception is started (i.e., the
first party is joined to the conference)
\- When interception is activated (on a conference or a conference owner)
during an ongoing conference
\- When parties have joined a conference and communication is started or
enabled by the conference server in cases where the conference is a target of
interception or when it is a target's conference.
If the target of interception has provisioned or requested a conference to be
created, interception on IMS Conference Services shall begin regardless
whether the target of interception has joined the conference. Interception of
IMS Conference Services shall continue if the target of interception is on
hold and the conference continues.
## 11.2 Provision of Intercepted Content of Communication -- IMS Conference
Services
### 11.2.0 General
The access method for the delivery of IMS conference services intercept
content of communication (CC) is based on duplication of packets without
modification at the MRFP for conferences that are to be intercepted. The
duplicated packets with additional information in the header, as described in
the following sections, are sent to DF3 for further delivery. For a target's
conference call held by the target, the MRFP duplicates the CC for conference
call held by the target, in accordance with national regulations. For a
conference call that is the target of interception, the MRFP duplicates the CC
for the conference.
NOTE: There is an issue of combined versus separated delivery. With combined
delivery, one method for intercepting the CC would be to create a virtual
conference port (not visible to others) through which a copy of the combined
CC could be passed over the X3 interface (Y conferees means 1 content stream).
With the separated delivery approach, each conferee's connection to the
conference would need to be intercepted and passed over the X3 interface (Y
conferees, means Y pairs of bi-directional content streams).
Figure 11.1: Configuration for interception of IMS Conference Services CC
### 11.2.1 X3-interface
In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following
information may need to be transferred from the MRFP to the DF3 in order to
allow the DF3 to perform its functionality:
\- identity used for interception;
\- correlation number;
NOTE 1: Information passed between the MRFC and MRFP for correlation has to
uniquely identify the mixing of associated media streams for a conference
distinct from any other mixing or media handling. An example is how H.248 uses
a context identifier to do this.
\- the identity of source (i.e., conference party identity) of a media stream;
\- time stamp - optional;
\- direction (incoming or outgoing stream) -- optional.
NOTE 2: When the media is delivered in a mixed format, the identity of the
media stream source may be unknown.
## 11.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information for IMS Conference Service
### 11.3.0 General
Figure 11.2 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If
an event for / from or associated with a conference server occurs, the AS/MRFC
sends the relevant data to the DF2.
NOTE: Reporting of non-transmission related actions of a target's subscriber
controlled input (e.g., signalling \"mute\" commands) is for further study.
Figure 11.2: Provision of Intercept Related Information for IMS Conferencing
### 11.3.1 X2-interface
The following information may need to be transferred from the AS/MRFC to the
DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity (IMPU, IMPI, Conference URI);
\- events and associated parameters as defined in section 11.3.3 \"Structure
of Conference Events\" may be provided;
\- Correlation number;
\- Bandwidth and media descriptions (e.g., as associated with SDP negotiation)
associated with the parties' bearer connection to the conference.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
### 11.3.2 IMS Conference Events and Event Information
The following events are applicable to AS/MRFC:
\- Start of Conference
\- Party Join;
\- Party Leave;
\- Conference Bearer Modification;
\- Start of Intercept on an Active Conference;
\- End of Conference;
\- Creation of Conference;
\- Update of Conference.
NOTE 1: Reporting of Floor Control events from the MRFP is FFS.
A set of possible elements as shown below that may be reported with the
events. Information associated with the events is transmitted from the AS/MRFC
server to DF2.

# 12 Lawful Interception for Evolved Packet System
## 12.1 LI functional architecture for EPS
In addition to the reference configurations applicable to PS interception, the
following figures contain the reference configuration applicable for the
lawful interception in the EPS nodes ([22], [23]):
Figure 12.1.1: MME Intercept configuration
Figure 12.1.1a: Configuration for Intercept of HeNB
{width="5.508333333333334in" height="2.8868055555555556in"}
Figure 12.1.2: HSS Intercept configuration
Figure 12.1.3: S-GW, PDN-GW, ePDG Intercept configuration
The definition of the LI functional entities (ADMF, DF, MF, LEMF) and
interfaces (X, HI) is the same as for 3G as given in chapter 4. Packet Header
Information Reporting is a national option. For Packet Header Information
Reporting, a S-GW/PDN-GW either isolates the relevant data and sends it to the
DF2 or sends the packet stream to another entity in the network (e.g., DF3)
for isolation which then provides the relevant data to the DF2.
Procedures for LI activation, deactivation and interrogation are the same as
for 3G as given in chapter 5, provided that:
\- the 3G ICE is replaced by the EPS node;
\- the proper target identity applicable to EPS node is used.
When the SGSN is used as node in the Evolved Packet System, to support 2G/3G
access and mobility between E-UTRAN and pre-E-UTRAN 3GPP radio access
technologies, it is subjected to all the related PS requirements specified
throughout this document.
Figure 12.1.1a depicts how the HeNB location information is transferred from
the HeNB location verifying node per TS 33.320 [34] to the DF2 via an Xv
interface, in order to allow the DF2 to perform its functionality. The public
IP Address of the HeNB is provided to the HeNB location verifying node. The
manner that the HeNB location verifying node provides the DF2 with the HeNB
location and HeNB IP Address is outside the scope of this document. Additional
information on HeNB interception is found in Clause X.
The target identities for 3GPP HeNB interception can be IMSI, MSISDN, IMEI, or
ME Id. Use of the HeNB ID or the CSG ID as a target identity is FFS.
## 12.2 Functional requirements for LI in case of E-UTRAN access and GTP based
S5/S8.
### 12.2.0 General
The target identities for interception at the MME, HSS, S-GW and PDN-GW are
IMSI, MSISDN and ME (Mobile Equipment) Identity.
NOTE 1: Details about information included in the ME Identity and the
relationship with IMEI needs to be considered. The term Mobile Equipment
Identity is used in this text according to [22] so as to indicate that the EPC
should support multiple equipment identity formats (e.g. those from 3GPP2,
WiMAX, etc) as well as the IMEISV.
NOTE 2: In case of local breakout the PDN Gateway is in the VPLMN. In this
case LI relevant information in the H-PLMN might be available at the H-PCRF.
Interception at the H-PCRF is FFS.
NOTE 3: In case the ME Identity and/or MSISDN is not available in a node,
interception based on the missing identity is not applicable at that node.
NOTE 4: MSISDN is a possible identity available in the EPC nodes, which may be
provided by the HSS to the MME and then forwarded to the S-GW/PDN-GW.
As the MME only handles control plane, interception of Content of
Communication is applicable only at the S-GW and PDN-GW. As the HSS only
handles signaling, interception of Content of Communication is not applicable
at this node.
LI in the PDN-GW is a national option.
For the delivery of the CC and IRI the S-GW and/or, per national option PDN-GW
provides correlation number and target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is
used there in order to select the different LEAs where the product shall be
delivered.
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is used to correlate CC
with IRI and the different IRI\'s of one EPS bearer.
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related
to the EPS bearer.
NOTE 5: If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data
communication both CC and IRI will be delivered for each party as separate
intercept activity.
Location Dependent Interception for EPC is FFS.
### 12.2.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information
#### 12.2.1.0 General
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at the Mobile Entity
Attach, Mobile Entity Detach, Tracking Area/EPS Location Update, Bearer
activation (valid for both Default and Dedicated bearer), Start of Intercept
with bearer active, Start of Interception with E-UTRAN attached UE, Bearer
Modification, Bearer Deactivation, Serving Evolved Packet System (applicable
to the HSS), UE requested PDN connectivity, UE requested PDN disconnection,
and UE requested bearer resource modification.
Serving Evolved Packet System event reporting is a national option.
#### 12.2.1.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the EPS nodes or the
HSS to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity (IMSI, MSISDN, ME identity);
\- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.2.1.2 and 12.2.3
may be provided;
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception;
\- correlation number;
\- Quality of Service (QoS) information (if available);
\- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC),
if available and necessary.
For HeNB interception, the MME shall provide in addition the following:
\- HeNB Identity;
\- HeNB location.
HeNB location information needs to be transferred from the HeNB location
verifying node to the DF2 in order to allow the DF2 to perform its
functionality.
The EPS nodes detect packets containing packet header information in the
communications path but the information needed for Packet Header Information
Reporting may need to be transferred from the EPS nodes either directly to the
DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its
functionality.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
#### 12.2.1.2 Structure of the events
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2
if this is required. Details are described in the following clause. The events
for interception are configurable (if they are sent to DF2) in the EPC nodes
or the HSS and can be suppressed in the DF2. The network procedures for which
the events are generated are defined in [22].
**The following events are applicable to the MME:**
\- Attach;
\- Detach;
\- Tracking Area/EPS Location Update;
> \- UE requested PDN connectivity;
>
> \- UE Requested PDN disconnection;
>
> \- Start of interception with E-UTRAN attached UE.
**The following events are applicable to the Serving GW and PDN GW:**
\- Bearer activation (valid for both Default and Dedicated bearer);
\- Start of intercept with bearer active;
\- Bearer modification;
\- Bearer deactivation;
> \- UE Requested Bearer Resource Modification;
\- Packet Data Header Information..
**The following events are applicable to the HSS:**
  * Serving Evolved Packet System.
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events
trigger the transmission of the information from the nodes to DF2. Available
IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the nodes, if
this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information
if this is necessary as a national option. If interception is performed at the
PDN GW, then Packet Header Information Reporting shall also be performed at
the PDN GW and not at the Serving GW.

### 12.2.2 X3-interface
The access method for the delivering of S-GW and/or PDN-GW Intercept Product
is based on duplication of packets without modification at the S-GW and/or
PDN-GW. The duplicated packets with additional information in a header are
sent to DF3 for further delivery to the LEA.
Figure 12.2.2.1: Configuration for interception of S-GW/PDN-GW product data
In addition to the intercepted content of communication, the following
information needs to be transferred from the S-GW and/or the PDN-GW to the DF3
to perform its functionality:

#### 12.2.3.14 Packet Header Information Reporting
##### 12.2.3.14.0 Introduction
Packet Header Information Reporting can be done either on a per-packet (i.e.,
non-summarized) basis or in a summary report.
##### 12.2.3.14.1 Packet Data Header Report
This event is used to provide packet header reports on a per packet basis
(non-summarized reporting) and is triggered by each packet sent or received by
the target. These elements will be delivered by the S-GW/PDN-GW either
directly to DF2 or via another network entity, if available:

* * *
##### 12.2.3.14.2 Packet Data Summary Report
This event is used to report:
1) the source and destination information derived from the packet headers,
including:
a) source and destination IP Addresses,
b) IP next-layer protocol,
c) Layer-4 ports, and
d) Flow label, if the packet is IPv6
2) summary information for the number of packets and bytes transmitted or
received by the target for each unique packet flow within an EPS bearer, and
3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that
packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 6-tuple of source/destination IP
address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and EPS bearer.
> IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always reported, the flow
> label is reported if the packet is IPv6, and the layer-4 ports are reported.
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique packet data session
(EPS bearer) and packet flow, and is triggered by one of the following:
\- start of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer
\- an interim report for a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer is to be
reported
\- end of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer (including end of the
EPS bearer itself).
An interim report can be triggered by
\- The expiration of a configurable timer per intercept (called a Summary
Timer). The Summary Timer is configurable in units of seconds;
\- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached.
These elements will be delivered either directly to DF2 or via a MF for each
packet flow if available:

## 12.3 Functional requirements for LI in case of E-UTRAN access and PMIP
based S5/S8 interfaces
### 12.3.0 General
Functional requirements for LI in the MME, S-GW and HSS do not differ from the
ones applicable to the case of GTP based S5-S8 interfaces, as specified in
clause 12.2 and subclauses.
LI in the PDN-GW is a national option.
Interception in the PDN-GW shall be based on one or more of NAI, MSISDN, IMEI.
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the PDN-GW provides correlation number and
target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is used there in order to select the
different LEAs where the product shall be delivered.
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is used to correlate CC
with IRI and the different IRI\'s of one IP-CAN session. However, when
different protocols (i.e. GTP and PMIP) are used in the network, different
values can be generated by different nodes.
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related
to the IP-CAN session.
NOTE: If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data
communication both CC and IRI will be delivered for each party as separate
intercept activity.
### 12.3.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information
#### 12.3.1.0 General
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at attach/tunnel
activation, detach/tunnel deactivation, start of interception with active PMIP
tunnel, PMIP session modification, PDN-GW initiated PDN-disconnection, UE
requested PDN connectivity, Serving Evolved Packet System.
Serving Evolved Packet System reporting is a national option. Requirements on
the HSS specified in section 12.2 and subsections apply also to the case in
which S5/S8 interfaces are PMIP based.
#### 12.3.1.1 X2 interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the PDN-GW to the DF2
in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity;
\- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.3.1.2 and 12.3.3
may be provided;
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception; (FFS)
\- correlation number;
\- Quality of Service (QoS) information, if available;
\- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC),
if available and necessary.
The PDN-GW detect packets containing packet header information in the
communications path but the information needed for Packet Header Information
Reporting may need to be transferred from the PDN-GW either directly to the
DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its
functionality.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
#### 12.3.1.2 Structure of the events
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2
if this is required. The events for interception are configurable (if they are
sent to DF2) in the PDN-GW and can be suppressed in the DF2. The network
procedures for which the events are generated are defined in [23].
**The following events are applicable to the PDN-GW:**
\- PMIP Attach/tunnel activation;
\- PMIP Detach/tunnel deactivation;
\- PMIP session modification
\- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel;
> \- PMIP PDN-GW initiated PDN-disconnection;
\- Packet Data Header Information..
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events
trigger the transmission of the information from the nodes to DF2. Available
IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the nodes, if
this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information
if this is necessary as a national option.

### 12.3.2 X3-interface
The access method for the delivering of PDN-GW Intercept Product is based on
duplication of packets without modification at the PDN-GW. The duplicated
packets with additional information in a header are sent to DF3 for further
delivery to the LEA.

3) the date and the time of the first and last packets associated with that
packet flow. A packet flow is defined as the 6-tuple of source/destination IP
address/port number and the layer 4 protocol and EPS bearer.
> IP addresses and the IP next-layer protocol are always reported, the flow
> label is reported if the packet is IPv6, and the layer-4 ports are reported.
The event provides packet summary reports for each unique packet data session
(EPS bearer) and packet flow, and is triggered by one of the following:
\- start of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer
\- an interim report for a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer is to be
reported
\- end of a packet flow associated with an EPS bearer (including end of the
EPS bearer itself).
An interim report can be triggered by
\- The expiration of a configurable timer per intercept (called a Summary
Timer). The Summary Timer is configurable in units of seconds;
\- A per-intercept configurable count threshold is reached.

## 12.4 Functional requirements for LI in case of trusted non-3GPP IP access
### 12.4.0 General
Differently to what happens in E-UTRAN case, in which the user traffic passes
through the S-GW and then through the PDN-GW, there are two cases of access to
the network through S2a (trusted Non-3GPP access) that require additional
consideration. Specifically, the PDN-GW is the only possible ICE in the 3GPP
network in the case of non-roaming (PDN-GW in the HPLMN) and in the case of
roaming with local breakout (PDN-GW is located in the VPLMN) Therefore, in
these cases, interception at the PDN-GW is required.
In case of access to the network through S2a (trusted Non-3GPP access) for
roaming without local breakout (PDN-GW in the HPLMN and S-GW in the VPLMN),
interception at the PDN-GW is a national option.
Interception in the S-GW and PDN-GW shall be based on IMSI or NAI.
NOTE: The NAI may be a temporary ID, therefore the use of IMSI is recommended.
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the S-GW and/or PDN-GW provides
correlation number and target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is used there
in order to select the different LEAs where the product shall be delivered.
The correlation number is unique in the whole PLMN and is used to correlate CC
with IRI and the different IRI\'s of one IP-CAN session. However, when
different protocols (i.e. GTP and PMIP) are used in the network, different
values can be generated by different nodes
The correlation number shall be generated by using existing parameters related
to the IP-CAN session.
NOTE: If interception has been activated for both parties of the Packet Data
communication both CC and IRI will be delivered for each party as separate
intercept activity.
### 12.4.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information
#### 12.4.1.0 General
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at attach/tunnel
activation on interfaces s2a and s2c, session modification, detach/tunnel
deactivation, start of interception with active tunnel, PDN-GW reallocation
upon initial attach on s2c, PDN GW initiated resource allocation Deactivation
on s2a, Serving Evolved Packet System.
Serving Evolved Packet System reporting is a national option.
#### 12.4.1.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the S-GW, PDN-GW or the
HSS to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity;
\- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.4.1.2 and 12.4.3
may be provided;
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception; (FFS)
\- correlation number;
\- Quality of Service (QoS) information, if available;
\- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC),
if available and necessary.
The PDN-GW/S-GW detect packets containing packet header information in the
communications path but the information needed for Packet Header Information
Reporting may need to be transferred from the PDN-GW/S-GW either directly to
the DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its
functionality.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
#### 12.4.1.2 Structure of the events
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2
if this is required. The events for interception are configurable (if they are
sent to DF2) in the S-GW, PDN-GW or the HSS and can be suppressed in the DF2.
**The following events are applicable to the S-GW:**
\- PMIP attach/tunnel activation;
\- PMIP detach/tunnel deactivation;
\- PMIP session modification;
\- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel;- Packet Data Header
Information.
**The following events are applicable to the PDN-GW:**
\- PMIP attach/tunnel activation;
\- PMIP detach/tunnel deactivation;
**\- PMIP session modification;**
\- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel;
\- MIP registration/tunnel activation;
\- DSMIP registration/tunnel activation;
\- DSMIP session modification;
\- MIP deregistration/tunnel deactivation;
\- DSMIP deregistration/tunnel deactivation;
\- Start of interception with active MIP tunnel;
\- Start of interception with active DSMIP tunnel;
\- DSMIP HA Switch;
\- PMIP Resource Allocation Deactivation;
\- MIP Resource Allocation Deactivation;
\- Bearer activation;
\- Bearer deactivation;
\- Bearer modification;
\- Start of interception with active bearer;
\- Packet Data Header Information..
NOTE: Bearer activation, bearer deactivation, bearer modification and start of
interception with active bearer are applicable to trusted non-3GPP access when
the GTP protocol is used over s2a interface as specified in 3GPP TS 23.402
[23].
**The following event is applicable to the HSS:**
\- Serving Evolved Packet System.
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events
trigger the transmission of the information from the nodes to DF2. Available
IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the nodes, if
this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information
if this is necessary as a national option. In case GTP protocol is used over
s2a interface, elements from table 12.2.1.2 are included in the applicable
events. If interception is performed at the PDN GW, then Packet Header
Information Reporting shall also be performed at the PDN GW and not at the
Serving GW.

### 12.4.2 X3-interface
The access method for the delivering of S-GW and/or PDN-GW Intercept Product
is based on duplication of packets without modification at the S-GW and/or
PDN-GW. The duplicated packets with additional information in a header are
sent to DF3 for further delivery to the LEA.
Figure 12.4.2.1: Configuration for interception of S-GW/PDN-GW product data
n addition to the intercepted content of communication, the following
information needs to be transferred from the S-GW and/or the PDN-GW to the DF3
to perform its functionality:
  * target identity;
  * correlation number;
  * time stamp (optional);
  * direction (indicates whether T-PDU is MO or MT) -- optional;
  * the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent interception.
NOTE: location dependent interception for EPC is FFS.

## 12.5 Functional requirements for LI in case of untrusted non-3GPP IP access
### 12.5.0 Introduction
This clause specifies functional requirements applicable to the PDN-GW and
HSS. In addition, this clause specifies requirements applicable to the ePDG in
case this node is using a GTPv2 based protocol over s2b interface as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.402 [23].
The e-PDG not using a GTPv2 based protocol over s2b interface and the AAA
server are subjected to all the requirements specified in this document for
PDG and AAA server for the case of I-WLAN interworking.
NOTE 1: WLAN Interworking specifications (TS 23.234 [14], TS 24.234 [17] and
TS 29.234 [16]) are no longer maintained for Release 12 onwards. This clause
is therefore no longer maintained for WLAN Interworking.
Interception in the PDN-GW is a national option.
Interception in the PDN-GW shall be based on IMSI or NAI. In case of GTPv2
based protocol, interception at the ePDG and PDN-GW shall be based on IMSI.
NOTE: The NAI may be a temporary ID, therefore the use of IMSI is recommended.
For the delivery of the CC and IRI, the PDN-GW and ePDG provides correlation
number and target identity to the DF2 and DF3 which is used there in order to
select the different LEAs where the product shall be delivered.
### 12.5.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information
#### 12.5.1.0 General
Intercept Related Information (Events) shall be sent at attach/tunnel
activation on interfaces s2b and s2c, detach/tunnel deactivation, session
modification, start of interception with active tunnel, Serving Evolved Packet
System.
In case of GTPv2 based s2b, Intercept Related Information shall be sent at
attach/bearer activation, detach/bearer deactivation, bearer modification and
start of interception with active bearer.
Serving Evolved Packet System reporting is a national option.
#### 12.5.1.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the PDN-GW, ePDG or the
HSS to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity;
\- events and associated parameters as defined in clause 12.5.1.2 and 12.5.3
may be provided;
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception; (FFS)
\- correlation number;
\- Quality of Service (QoS) information, if available;
\- encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC),
if available and necessary.
The PDN-GW detect packets containing packet header information in the
communications path but the information needed for Packet Header Information
Reporting may need to be transferred from the PDN-GW either directly to the
DF2 or via another network entity in order to allow the DF2 to perform its
functionality.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
#### 12.5.1.2 Structure of the events
There are several different events in which the information is sent to the DF2
if this is required. The events for interception are configurable (if they are
sent to DF2) in the PDN-GW, ePDG or the HSS and can be suppressed in the DF2.
**The following events are applicable to the PDN-GW:**
\- PMIP attach/tunnel activation;
\- PMIP detach/tunnel deactivation;
\- PMIP session modification;
\- Start of interception with active PMIP tunnel;
\- DSMIP registration/tunnel activation;
\- DSMIP deregistration/tunnel deactivation;
\- DSMIP session modification;
\- Start of interception with active DSMIP tunnel;
\- DSMIP HA Switch;
\- PMIP Resource Allocation Deactivation ;
\- Packet Header Information
\- Bearer activation;
\- Bearer deactivation;
\- Bearer modification;
\- Start of interception with active bearer.
**The following events are applicable to the ePDG:**
\- Bearer activation;
\- Bearer deactivation;
\- Bearer modification:
\- Start of interception with active bearer.
**The following events is applicable to the HSS:**
\- Serving Evolved Packet System
A set of elements as shown below can be associated with the events. The events
trigger the transmission of the information from the nodes to DF2. Available
IEs from this set of elements as shown below can be extended in the nodes, if
this is necessary as a national option. DF2 can extend available information
if this is necessary as a national option. When the GTP protocol is used over
the s2b interface, elements from table 12.2.1.2 are included in the applicable
events.

When an handover is performed from CDMA2000 Access to E-UTRAN, the MME shall
intercept the attach event received from the HRPD AN based on IMSI.
Interception at S-GW and PDN-GW shall be done according to the requirements
given in section 12.2 or 12.3 and related subsections, depending on the
protocol used over the S5/S8 interface.
## 12.7 Functional requirements for LI in case of interworking between SGSN
and EPS nodes over S4/S12 interfaces
The SGSN and the HSS are subjected to the requirements applicable to these
nodes for PS interception, as specified throughout this document.
The S-GW is subjected to the requirements specified in section 12.2 and
subsections. The applicable events shall be reported also when received from
the SGSN over S4 interface. CC shall be also reported when received over
S4/S12 interfaces. The network procedures for which the events applicable to
the S-GW, defined in section 12.2 and subsections, are generated when the S-GW
is connected over S4/S12 interfaces to a SGSN are defined in [10].
The PDN-GW is subjected to the requirements specified in section 12.2 or 12.3
and related subsections, depending on the protocol used on S5/S8 interfaces,
which are applicable also to the case in which the PDN-GW is involved for a
target for which a S4 based SGSN is used.
## 12.8 Functional requirements for LI in case of interworking between SGSN
and PDN-GW over Gn/Gp interfaces
According to [10] and [22] a PDN-GW may provide a Gn/Gp interface for
interworking with the SGSN. When this interface is provided, from LI
perspective the PDN-GW acts as a GGSN towards the involved SGSN. In this case,
in addition to the requirements specified in this clause, all the requirements
specified by this document for the GGSN are applicable to the PDN-GW.
The PDN-GW shall use the same correlation number in records when the PDP
context/EPS bearer modification signalling is detected due to the handover
between different accesses involving a Gn/Gp interface (i.e. from E-UTRAN to
2G/3G and vice versa). After the handover, the PDN-GW shall report the events
applicable to the new access and continue to use the same correlation number
inside the same PDP context/EPS bearer.
The SGSN is subjected to the requirements applicable to this node for PS
interception, as specified throughout this document.
# 13 Lawful Interception for 3GPP H(e)NBs
## 13.0 General
Home Node B (HNB) and Home enhanced Node B (HeNB) are jointly referred to as
H(e)NB as defined in TS 22.220 [31]. As identified in TS 33.106 [7], lawful
interception for 3GPP H(e)NBs can be based on three different targets: a
target accessing a H(e)NB, a target CSG of a H(e)NB, and a target H(e)NB.
LI for a target CSG is FFS.
LI for a target H(e)NB is FFS.
LI for Local IP Access (LIPA) via a H(e)NB is FFS.
## 13.1 Provision of Intercepted Content of Communications for 3GPP H(e)NBs
The access method for the delivery of intercepted content of communications
(CC) is based on duplication of packets without modification.
See clause 13.4 for UMTS HNB specifics and 13.5 for HeNB specifics.
Note: In the case where the UE is the target of intercept, from the
perspective of the core network, a H(e)NB is treated the same as a NodeB or
eNodeB for CC interception purposes (i.e., no additional LI functionality is
required).
## 13.2 Provision of Intercept Related Information for 3GPP H(e)NBs
### 13.2.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred to the DF2 in order to allow
a DF2 to perform its functionality:

\- events and associated parameters as defined in sections 13.4.3 may be
provided;
\- the H(e)NB location (if available);
\- H(e)NB ID;
H(e)NB location information needs to be transferred from the location
verifying nodes per TS 33.320 [34]to the DF2 in order to allow the DF2 to
perform its functionality. The manner that the location verifying node
provides the DF2 with the H(e)NB location is outside the scope of this
document.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.

# 14 Interception of Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) Secured
Communications
## 14.1 Introduction
The Generic Bootstrapping Architecure (GBA) is defined in the 3GPP TS 33.220
[35]. This section details the stage 2 Lawful Interception architecture and
functions that are needed to provide the GBA based application specific
encryption keys from the GBA architecture towards the DF2 for a subscriber
that is target of interception.
Figure 14.1 shows the LI architecture for the GBA where the BSF provides the
events and associated information towards the DF2 over the X2 interface.
Figure 14.1: GBA Intercept Configuration
## 14.2 Provision of Content of Communications
The GBA interception provides the application specific cryptographic keys (aka
GBA application specific keys) which are used to decrypt the intercepted
communication secured using those GBA application specific keys. Interception
of the content of communications for GBA secured services is not part of this
section and can be achieved via other methods outlined in this specification.
The Ua protocol Id and the NAF Id along with the GBA application specific keys
will allow the LEMF to decrypt the received intercepted packets.
Note 1: The details of LI capabilities for GBA in a roaming scenario is for
further study.
Note 2: The delivery by the CSP of intercepted packets in a decrypted form is
for further study.
## 14.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information
### 14.3.1 Provision of Intercept Related Information Data Flow
Figure 14.2 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If
an event related to a target occurs, the BSF shall send the relevant data to
the DF2.

# 15 Invocation of Lawful Interception for IMS-based VoIP
## 15.1 Overview of VoIP Interception
The capabilities defined in this clause apply when the interception of content
of communications for IMS-based VoIP is to be separated from the interception
of content of communication at the packet data network.
The network nodes, involved in providing the interception of an IMS-based VoIP
call, shall be determined based on the deployment configuration and the call
scenario. The scenarios where the media transport nodes and signalling nodes
are handled by different CSPs are beyond the scope of this standard.
Note 1: Lawful interception of VoIP as it applies SR-VCC (see 23.237 [46]) is
for further study.
The interception of IRI for a VoIP call shall be done according to 15.3. The
interception of VoIP CC shall be done according to 15.2.
## 15.2 Provision of Content of Communications
As the interception of CC needs to be done at a network node that has access
to the voice media, and that interception of CC is required for all targeted
calls, including forwarded calls and transferred calls, the CSP needs to
support the capability to dynamically trigger CC interception for a call at a
network node that has access to the voice media. Depending on the CSP's
network configuration and the call scenario, different network elements will
intercept the CC.
The interception and delivery of CC for VoIP may be done at the following
functional element:
1) PDN-GW/GGSN;
2) IMS-AGW;
3) TrGW;
4) IM-MGW;
5) MRF.
Note 2: Other functional elements may also be applicable in specific
deployment scenarios.
Note 3: The redirection of target communications to a specific network element
purely for LI purposes is undesirable.
The functional elements that provide the signalling to generate the trigger
for the CC interception may be any of the following functional elements:
\- P-CSCF, for PDN-GW/GGSN and IMS-AGW;
\- IBCF for TrGW;
\- MGCF for IM-MGW
\- S-CSCF or AS for MRF.
At any given time, for a specific target and for any given call, only one
functional element is required to provide the CC interception. The functional
element that provides the CC interception may vary, primarily, based on the
call scenario.
Annex E shows scenarios where the use of the above functional elements are
applicable.
### 15.2.1 General Principles of CC Interception
#### 15.2.1.1 Intercept Trigger
As the interception of IRI and CC is required for all targeted VoIP calls,
including forwarded and transferred calls, the CC shall be correlated with the
IRI. The CC Interception Triggering Function triggers the CC interception for
a call at the CC Intercept Function. The placement of the CC Interception
Triggering Function is dependent on CSP network implementation, the call
scenario, and the placement of network nodes that have access to the voice
media.
The CC Interception Triggering Functions sends a CC intercept trigger to the
CC Interception Function to activate CC interception for a call.
The intercept trigger, at the minimum, shall consist of the following:
\- Correlation Identifier (the mechanics of correlation is for further study);
\- Media Identifier
Editor's Note: The re-use of the existing reference point or whether to use a
new reference point is for further study.
The Correlation Identifier is used correlate the CC with the corresponding IRI
data and is delivered from the CC Intercept Function in the intercepted media
packet (i.e., CC) over the X3 interface to the Delivery Function 3.
The Media Identifier is used to identify the media packets that have to be
intercepted. The technique used in defining the Media Identifier is
implementation specific.
The information passed in this CC intercept trigger shall adhere to the
security requirements outlined in clause 8.
#### 15.2.1.2 X3-Interface
For the delivery of intercepted media packets, the following information shall
be passed from the CC Intercept Function to the Delivery Function 3 in
addition to the intercepted media packets:
\- target identity;
\- correlation identifier;
\- time stamp (optional);
\- direction (indicates media is from or to the target) -- optional;
Editor's Note: The use of the target identity for the information passed to
the Delivery Function 3 requires further study.
The Delivery Function 3 delivers the information to the LEMF over the HI3
interface based on the national regulations.
### 15.2.2 VoIP CC Interception
The capabilities defined in this clause apply for the following cases:
\- When a target originates a call or receives an incoming call -- the
target's media passes through the indicated CC Intercept Function.
\- When an incoming call to the target is forwarded, the media of the
forwarded call passes through the indicated CC Intercept Function.
The term \"CC Intercept Function\" is a generic term used to denote a network
function that has access to the voice media of an intercepted call. The term
\"CC Interception Triggering Function\" is a generic term used to denote a
network function that provides a trigger to intercept the CC. The examples of
CC Intercept Function and CC Interception Triggering Function are listed at
the beginning of clause 15.2
Figure 15.1 illustrates the CC interception at the CC Intercept Function for a
basic call. Figure 15.2 illustrates the CC interception at the CC Intercept
Function for a forwarded call.
Figure 15.1: VoIP CC Interception for basic calls
In figure 15.1, the Target is the target and the Other Party is the called
party when the target originates a call; and the Other Party is the calling
party when the target receives an incoming call. In both cases, the media
passes through the CC Intercept Function present on the side of target's
access network.
In figure 15.2 (below), there is no Target (i.e., target) shown because this
is the scenario where an incoming call to a target gets forwarded. The figure
15.2 shows the calling party who originated call and the forwarded-to-party
who receives the forwarded call. The media passes through the CC Intercept
Function associated with the forwarded-to-party.
Figure 15.2: VoIP CC Interception for forwarded calls
The CC Interception Triggering Function sends the CC intercept trigger to the
CC Intercept Function according 15.2.1.1. The CC Intercept Function intercepts
media packets for the call (identified based on the Media Identifier
information received over the intercept trigger) and delivers the media
packets as according to 15.2.1.2.
Editor's Note: Exact use of figures 15.1 and 15.2 in call forwarding scenarios
needs to be clarified.
## 15.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information for VoIP
See clause 7.A.
# 16 LI for Group Communications using GCSE
## 16.1 Background
There are several scenarios possible for the interception of group
communications involving GCSE (see TS 22.468 [51] and TS 23.468[53]). First is
where the GCSE AS is part of an operator's network. Second is where the GCSE
AS is outside of the intercepting operator's network. This clause specifies LI
solutions for both cases.
## 16.2 GCSE AS in Operator Network
### 16.2.0 General
In the case where the GCSE AS is in the operator's network, the ICE in this
case will be the GCSE AS as it is fully aware of the group communications as
well as the parties on the communications. The solution is very similar to the
conferencing solution specified in Clause 11, where the main difference is
that a single functional entity (the GCSE AS) is utilized for GCSE, rather
than two functional entities.
Figure 16.1: GCSE AS Intercept configuration
### 16.2.1 Provision of Content of Communications
#### 16.2.1.0 General
Figure 16.2 shows the interception of the content of communications for GCSE
at the GCSE AS is performed based on identifying the target of interception
being a member of a group communication at the GCSE AS.
Figure 16.2: Provision of Intercept Product from GCSE AS
#### 16.2.1.1 X3-interface
In addition to the intercepted content of communications, the following
information may need to be transferred from the GCSE AS to the DF3 in order to
allow the DF3 to perform its functionality:
\- identity used for interception include IMSI, IMEI, ProSe UE ID (see TS
22.278 [50] and TS 23.303 [51]);
\- correlation number;
\- the identity of source (i.e., group communications party identity) of a
media stream;
\- time stamp;
\- direction (from target or to target).
### 16.2.2 Provision of Intercept Related Information
#### 16.2.2.0 General
Figure 16.3 shows the transfer of intercept related information to the DF2. If
an event for / from a GCSE user occurs, the GCSE ASshall send the relevant
data to the DF2.
Figure 16.3: Provision of Intercept Related Information
#### 16.2.2.1 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the GCSE AS to the DF2
in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
> \- target identity include IMSI, IMEI, ProSe UE ID;
>
> \- events and associated parameters as defined in clauses X.1.2.2 may be
> provided;
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
#### 16.2.2.2 GCSE AS LI Events and Event Information
##### 16.2.2.2.0 General
Intercept Related Information events to be reported by the GCS AS include:
\- When GCSE communications group involving a target of interception is
activated (enabled for communications)
\- When GCSE communications group involving a target of interception is
deactivated (no longer enabled for communications)
\- When a User is added to an active GCSE communications group
\- When a User is dropped from an active GCSE communications group
\- Start of Interception with an Active GCSE communications Group
\- End of Interception with an Active GCSE communications Group
\- Modification of Target Connection to GCS AS.
A set of possible elements as shown in Table 16.4 are used to generate the
events.

## 16.3 GCS AS outside Intercepting CSP Network
Interception of group communications by the intercepting CSP when the GCS AS
is outside of the CSP's network, is not provided in this release. Packet data
interception capabilities can be used to intercept and report a target's
communication.
# 17 Interception for Proximity Services
## 17.1 ProSe Direct Discovery
### 17.1.1 General
Proximity Service (ProSe) are specified in TS 23.303 [54]. This includes
Direct Discovery where two UEs may discover that they are in proximity using
direct signalling between the UEs, where such signalling both controlled by
and reported to the ProSe Function.
Figure 17.1-1: ProSe Direct Discovery Intercept configuration
Figure 17.1-1 shows the CC interception configuration for ProSe Direct
Discovery. The HI2 interface represents the interface between the LEA and the
delivery function. The delivery function is used to distribute the Intercept
Related Information (IRI) to the relevant LEA(s) via HI2. See Clause 4 for
more information on the ADMF and other interfaces.
The target identity for ProSe Direct Discovert interception is the IMSI. The
activation, deactivation, and interrogation of interception regarding the
ProSe Function shall follow the requirements of Clause 5.
### 17.1.2 Provision of Inteception of Call Content
Interception of direct discovery does not have a call content component as all
the information useful to the LEA is provided as part of the IRI interception.
### 17.1.3 Provision of Intercept Related Information
#### 17.1.3.1 General
Figure 17.1.3.1-1 shows the transfer of intercept related information (IRI) to
the DF2. If an event involving a target occurs, the ProSe Function shall send
the relevant data to the DF2. A UE always contacts the ProSe Function in its
HPLM, which then contacts the other relevant ProSe Functions to complete the
UEs request.In the case of Match Report event, it is possible that a non-
target monitoring UE will tigger interception of a target UE when it reports a
code announced by that target UE.
This is illustrated in the following figure where it should be noted that only
one subcriber to HPLMN ProSe Function interaction is needed to trigger an
interception event.
Figure 17.1.3.1-1: Provision of Intercept Related Information for discovery
#### 17.1.3.2 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the ProSe Function to
the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform its functionality:
\- target identity (IMSI);
\- events and associated parameters, as defined in section 17.1.3.3;
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
#### 17.1.3.3 ProSe LI Events and Event Information
##### 17.1.3.3.1 ProSe LI Events
The following events are applicable to the interception of direct discovery:
\- Discovery Request
\- Match Report
Interception of these events is mandatory in the ProSe Function of the PLMN
that is used for direct discovery.
##### 17.1.3.3.2 ProSe LI Event Information
A set of possible elements as shown below is used to generate the events.

##### 17.1.3.3.3 Structure of ProSe Events
###### 17.1.3.3.3.1 Discovery Request
For ProSe Discovery Requests, a Discovery Request event is generated. The
elements shown in Table 17.1.3.3.1-1 will be delivered by the ProSe Function
to the DF2, if available. A new Discovery Request Event shall be generated for
each individual ProSe Discovery Request received by the ProSe Function.

## 17.2 ProSe One To Many Communications
### 17.2.1 General
Proximity Service (ProSe) are specified in TS 23.303 [54]. This includes one
to many communications among Public Safety ProSe UEs with such communication
occuring while the UEs are in proximity. There are several procedures that
takes place with network elements as part of a typical one-to-many
commuication. The UE needs to be authorised by the ProSe Function, and receive
keys from the ProSe Key Management Function (PKMF - see TS 33.303[57]). After
such a communication, the UE reports the relevant usage information to the
ProSe Function. This subclause details the interception at the ProSe Function
and ProSe Key Management Function.
NOTE: The present document does not provide a solution for the interception of
content of communication.
Editor's note: Interception of ProSe one-to-many communication with the group
as the target is FFS.
Figure 17.2-1: ProSe One To Many Communications Intercept configuration
Figure 17.2-1 shows the IRI interception configuration for ProSe one to many
communications. The HI2 interface represents the interface between the LEMF
and the delivery function. The delivery function is used to distribute the
Intercept Related Information (IRI) to the relevant LEMF(s) via HI2. See
clause 4 for more information on the ADMF and other interfaces.
The target identity for interception is the IMSI.The activation, deactivation,
and interrogation of interception regarding the ProSe Function shall follow
the requirements of clause 5.
### 17.2.2 Provision of Intercept Product -- One-To-Many Communications
#### 17.2.2.1 General
Figure 17.2.2.1-1 shows the transfer of IRI relating to the one to many
communications from the ProSe Function and ProSe Key Management Function to
the DF2 and to the LEMF. If a target UE interacts with the ProSe Function or
ProSe Key Management Function relating to one-to-many communications, a One-
To-Many IRI event, is generated and sent via the Delivery Function 2 to the
LEMF.
If an event involving an target occurs, the ProSe Function or ProSe Key
Management Function shall send the relevant data to the DF2 for formatting and
delivery to the LEMF.
Figure 17.2.2.1-1: Provision of Intercept Product for Public Safety One-To-
Many Communications
NOTE: There is signalling between the non-target ProSe UEs and the ProSe
Function and PKMF, which is not shown in figure 17.2.2.1-1. This signalling is
not relevant to the interception of the target UE.
#### 17.2.2.2 X2-interface
The following information needs to be transferred from the ProSe Function or
ProSe Key Management Function to the DF2 in order to allow a DF2 to perform
its functionality:
\- target identity (IMSI);
\- events and associated parameters, as defined in section 17.2.2.3;
\- the target location (if available) or the IAs in case of location dependent
interception;
\- Quality of Service (QoS) identifier;
\- Encryption parameters (keys and associated parameters for decrypting CC),
if available and necessary.
The IRI should be sent to DF2 using a reliable transport mechanism.
#### 17.2.2.3 ProSe LI One-To-Many Events and Event Information
##### 17.2.2.3.1 Overview of ProSe LI One-To-Many Events
The following event are applicable to the interception of one to many
communications:
\- ProSe Function sends authorisation to perform one-To-many communications to
the target UE.
\- ProSe Key Management Function sends keys to use in one-to-may commuications
to the target UE.
\- ProSe Function receives a one-to-many communications usage information
report from the target UE.
Interception of these events is mandatory. .
##### 17.2.3.3.2 Structure of ProSe LI One-To-Many Event Information

###### ## Annex A (informative): Information flows for Lawful Interception
invocation of circuit switched services
The following figures show the information flows for the invocation of Lawful
Interception for various types of calls. The figures show some of the basic
signalling messages of the target calls and the events on the X2 and
X3-interfaces. The call control messages to and from the network are shown for
informational purposes only; some of them may not be sent or may be combined
in certain networks. The handling of the bearers for the basic calls is not
shown. The bearer points are established in a manner to minimise content loss
without delaying the call to the target. The bearer establishment to agency
will be in parallel or immediately following the bearer establishment to the
target. The flows portray both forward and backward bearer establishment and
release to the agency.
# A.1 Mobile originated circuit switched calls
Figure A.1 shows the interception of a basic mobile originated circuit
switched speech or data call where the originating mobile (A) is the target
for interception. B is not necessarily also a mobile subscriber and resides on
a different exchange.
Figure A.1: Interception of mobile originated circuit switched calls
In figure A.1 the result (answer) of the set-up of the stublines is not shown.
This assumes no special action is taken in case of failure.
# A.2 Mobile terminated circuit switched calls
Figure A.2 shows the interception of a basic mobile terminated circuit
switched speech or data call where the terminating mobile (B) is the target
for interception. A is not necessarily also a mobile subscriber and resides on
a different exchange.
Figure A.2: Interception of mobile terminated circuit switched calls
# A.3 Call hold / call waiting
Figures A.3 and A.4 show the interception of calls involving call hold / call
waiting. Figure A.3 covers the case where one pair of stublines is used per
target, figure A.4 covers the case where a separate pair of stublines is used
for each target call. The mobile that receives the waiting call (A) is the
target for interception.

Figures A.5 and A.6 show the interception of multiparty calls. Figure A.5
covers the case where one pair of stublines is used per target, figure A.6
covers the case where a separate pair of stublines is used for each target
call. The mobile setting up the multiparty call (A) is the target for
interception.

# A.5 Call forwarding / call deflection
## A.5.0 General
The following pictures show the information flows for the interception of
forwarded calls. Information flows will be given for three typical cases of
call forwarding. All other types of call forwarding / call deflection are
intercepted similar to one of these.
## A.5.1 Unconditional call forwarding
Figure A.7 shows the interception of unconditionally forwarded calls. The
mobile that activated unconditional call forwarding (B) is the target for
interception. In this case interception will be performed at the 3G GMSC,
where the Service Request Indicator (SRI) request for B is issued and
subsequently the SRI response indicating that the call shall be forwarded is
received.
Figure A.7: Interception of unconditional call forwarding
## A.5.2 Call forwarding on not reachable (IMSI detached)
Call forwarding on not reachable because the IMSI is detached is also handled
on the 3G GMSC. Interception of this type of call forwarding is similar to
interception of unconditional call forwarding.
## A.5.3 Call forwarding on busy (network determined)
Figure A.8 shows the interception of call forwarding on busy (network
determined). The mobile that activated call forwarding on busy (B) is the
target for interception. In this case interception will be performed at the 3G
MSC where B resides, where the busy condition is detected and the call is
forwarded.
Figure A.8: Interception of call forwarding on busy (network determined)
## A.5.4 Call forwarding on not reachable (no response to paging/radio channel
failure)
Call forwarding on not reachable because of no response to paging or radio
channel failure is also handled on the 3G MSC similar to call forwarding on
busy (network determined). Interception of this type of call forwarding is
therefore done in the same way (see clause A.5.3).
## A.5.5 Call forwarding on no reply
Figure A.9 shows the interception of call forwarding on no reply. The mobile
that activated call forwarding on no reply (B) is the target for interception.
In this case interception will be performed at the 3G MSC where B resides,
where the no reply condition is detected and the call is forwarded. Initially,
the interception is similar to the interception of a basic mobile terminated
circuit switched speech of data call. On no reply time-out, the interception
will continue on the forwarded call to C.
Figure A.9: Interception of call forwarding on no reply
In figure A.9 the release of the stublines is done after the forwarded call is
released by A or C. It is a national option not to support interception of
forwarded calls. In that case, the release of the stublines is done after the
call is forwarded and B is no longer involved.
## A.5.6 Call forwarding on busy (user determined)/call deflection
Call forwarding on busy (user determined) and call deflection are also handled
on the 3G MSC similar to call forwarding on no reply. Interception of this
type of call forwarding is therefore done in the same way (see A5.5).
## A.5.7 Call waiting / call forwarding on no reply
Figures A.10 and A.11 show the interception of a call involving both call
waiting and call forwarding on no reply. Figure A.10 covers the case where one
pair of stublines is used per target, figure A.11 covers the case where a
separate pair of stublines is used for each target call. The mobile that

target for interception. In figure A.10 a new pair of stublines needs to be
set up when the call is forwarded since the first pair of stublines is still
used for the initial call.

# A.6 Explicit call transfer
Figures A.12 and A.13 show the interception of explicit call transfer. Figure
A.12 covers the case where one pair of stublines is used per target, figure
A.13 covers the case where a separate pair of stublines is used for each
target call. The mobile transferring the call (B) is the target for
interception.
Figure A.12: Interception of explicit call transfer - stublines per target
Figure A.13: Interception of explicit call transfer - stublines per target
call
In figures A.12 and A.13 the release of the stublines is done after the
transferred call is released by A or C. It is a national option not to support
interception of transferred calls. In that case, the release of the stublines
is done after the call is transferred and B is no longer involved.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Information flows for Lawful Interception
invocation of GSN Packet Data services
# B.0 General
The following figures show the information flows for the invocation of Lawful
Interception for Packet Data and typical scenarios. The figures show some of
the basic signalling messages of the target Packet Data communication and the
events on the X2 and X3 interfaces. The dotted lines indicate signalling
depending on whether CC and/or IRI information has been requested. The Gateway
3G GGSN may setup/release packet tunnels and send IRI information depending on
national requirements.
The use of the Gateway 3G GGSN for interception is a national option.

# B.4 Intra 3G GSN Routing Area Update
Figure B.4 shows the interception of an Intra Routing Area Update where the
mobile (A) is the target for interception. The sequence is the same for the
combined RA / LA Update procedure but additional signalling is performed
between the current 3G SGSN and the prior 3G SGSN before the Routing Area
Update Accept message is sent to the MS.

# B.5 Inter 3G GSN Routing Area Update
Figure B.5 shows the interception of an Inter Routing Area Update where the
mobile (A) is the target for interception. The sequence is the same for the

Accept message is sent to the MS. In case of PDP context not being active less
signalling is required.

# B.6 PDP Context Activation
Figure B.6 shows the interception of a PDP Context activation where the mobile

and release the Packet Data tunnel after the Delete PDP Context Response has
been sent or received, (signalling between the 3G SGSN and the 3G GGSN is not
shown here).

###### ## Annex C (informative): Information flows for the invocation of
Lawful Interception for Packet Data with multimedia
# C.0 General
The following figures show the information flows for the invocation of Lawful
Interception for Packet Data with multimedia. The figures show some of the
basic signalling messages of the target Packet Data communication and the
events on the X2 interfaces. The dotted lines indicate signalling depending on
whether IRI information has been requested. The figures illustrate
interception in the visited network.
The figures in this annex only apply to scenarios where the P-CSCF is located
in the visited network. In some operator deployment scenarios, the P-CSCF will
be in the Home Network. Where the P-CSCF is located in the Home Network and UE
to P-CSCF signalling encryption is applied, all SIP messages between the
P-CSCF and the UE will be encrypted within the visited network and therefore
plain text interception in the visited network may not be possible.
# C.1 Multimedia registration
Figures C.1.1 and C.1.2 show the intercept of the Multimedia registration for
the case of visited network interception (refer to TS 23.228 clauses 5.3.2.4
and 5.3.2.5).
Figures C.1.1 and C.1.2 show the intercept of the Multimedia registration for
the case of visited network interception, where the P-CSCF is located in the
Visited Network (refer to TS 23.228 clauses 5.3.2.4 and 5.3.2.5).

###### ## Annex E (Informative) IMS-based VoIP Lawful Interception Call
Scenarios
# E.1 Overview
This informative annex provides the examples of call scenarios that illustrate
the interception and delivery of CC interception for an IMS-based VoIP call.
# E.2 Background
One of the use-cases of IMS-based VoIP service is VoLTE. The term \"VoLTE\" is
used to refer to an IMS-based VoIP service when EPS (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [22])
happens to be the access network. When EPS is not the access network, the
lawful interception capabilities defined in this informative annex applies for
any IMS-based VoIP service with the presumption that in those cases the media
on the target's access goes through an IMS-AGW (see 3GPP TS 29.334 [42]) or a
PDN-GW (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [22] and 3GPP TS 402 [23]) or a GGSN (UMTS
network).
Note 1: Even with the EPS-based access network, the media may still go through
the IMS-AGW. And, in this case, a VoLTE shall be treated very similar to any
other VoIP service.
Furthermore, it is presumed that an inter-CSP call enters or leaves an IMS
network via an IBCF/TrGW or an MGCF/IM-MGW depending on whether the inter-
working CSP network is an IMS-based network or a CS-based network (see 3GPP TS
23.228 [43]). Also, for an IMS roaming scenario, it is presumed that the
signalling and media enters or leaves the home CSP through the IBCF/TrGW.
The figure E.1 illustrates the VoIP configuration considered for the lawful
interception capabilities defined in this clause:
Figure E.1: IMS-based VoIP Configuration
Note 2: The configuration scenario where the media does not go through the
GGSN, or PDN-GW or the IMS-AGW is outside the scope of this document.
Note 3: In the remaining part of this informative annex, the PDN-GW/GGSN are
shown in one box and should read as either the GGSN (UMTS) or the PDN-GW
(EPS).
In figure E.1, the term \"media node\" is used to denote the network node
present on media path and the term \"signalling node\" is used to denote the
network node present on the signalling path.
The general concepts of VoIP LI is shown in figure E.2
Figure E.2: General Principles of VoIP Interception
In clause 15, the SIP signalling nodes provide signalling information to the
CC Interception Triggering Function. The CC Interception Triggering Function
triggers the CC interception at a media node that implements the CC Intercept
Function.
The following functional elements provide the CC Intercept Function in the
example call scenarios:
\- PDN-GW/GGSN;
\- IMS-AGW;
\- TrGW;
\- IM-MGW
\- MRF.
The following functional elements provide the signalling to the CC Intercept
Triggering Function:
\- P-CSCF for PDN-GW/GGSN and IMS-AGW;
\- IBCF for TrGW;
\- MGCF for IM-MGW
\- S-CSCF for MRF.
At any given time, for a specific target and for any given call, only one
functional element is required to provide the CC interception. The functional
element that provides the CC interception may vary, primarily, based on the
CSP network implementation and the call scenario.
# E.3 Originating Call from the Target with CC Interception at the PDN-GW/GGSN
## E.3.0 General
Figure E.3 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target originates a call with
PDN-GW (or GGSN) providing the CC interception.
Figure E.3: VoIP lawful interception for an originating call with CC
interception at the PDN-GW/GGSN
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is making a voice call and the called party can be within the same
CSP's network or in another CSP's network.
Figure E.3 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. However,
as specified in 7A, the IRI interception can also be done at the P-CSCF (not
shown in figure E.3). The CC interception is done at the PDN-GW/GGSN. The
P-CSCF sends the CC intercept trigger to the PDN-GW/GGSN.
Note 4: PCRF is defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [44].
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI).
## E.3.1 Originating Call from the Target with CC Interception at the MRF
Figure E.3.1 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC when a target originates a call with
an MRF providing the CC interception. The S-CSCF provides the CC Interception
Triggering Function for the MRF.
Figure E.3.1: VoIP lawful interception for an originating call with CC
interception at the MRF
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" indicates that the target is
making a voice call and the called party can be within the same CSP's network
or in another CSP's network.
IRI interception is done at the S-CSCF. The CC interception is done at an MRF
that functions as the CC ICE.
The MRF is deployed in a network configuration with an IP border access
controller that serves to hide the presence of the MRF. The IP access border
controller supports IP-level topology hiding for any voice media streams.
Specifically, the border gateway supports NAT functionality; always presents
its own IP address to the user; prevents ICMP Ping & ICMP Traceroute requests
from being forwarded across the gateway; and, resets TTL field in the IP
header.
Note 3.1: MRF is defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [43].
The ADF activates interception at the S-CSCF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI). The
S-CSCF dynamically triggers CC interception at the MRF for the call.
# E.4 Originating Call from the Target with CC Interception at the IMS-AGW
Figure E.4 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target originates a call with
IMS-AGW providing the CC interception.
Figure E.4: VoIP lawful interception for an originating call with CC
interception at the IMS-AGW
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is making a voice call and the called party can be within the same
CSP's network or in another CSP's network.
Figure E.4 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. However,
as specified in 7A, the IRI interception can also be done at the P-CSCF (not
shown in figure Z.4). The CC interception is done at the IMS-AGW. The P-CSCF
sends the CC intercept trigger to the IMS-AGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI).
# E.5 Terminating Call to the Target with CC Interception at the PDN-GW/GGSN
## E.5.0 General
Figure E.5 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target receives an incoming
call with PDN-GW/GGSN providing the CC interception.
Figure E.5: VoIP lawful interception for a terminating call with CC
interception at the PDN-GW/GGSN
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target are not
shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.5 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. However,
as specified in 7A, the IRI interception can also be done at the P-CSCF (not
shown in figure Z.5). The CC interception is done at the PDN-GW/GGSN. The
P-CSCF sends the CC intercept trigger to the PDN-GW/GGSN.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI).
## E.5.1 Terminating Call to the Target with CC Interception at the MRF
Figure E.5.1 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC when the target receives an incoming
call with an MRF providing the CC interception. The S-CSCF provides the CC
Interception Triggering Function for the MRF.
The MRF is deployed in a network configuration with an IP border access
controller that serves to hide the presence of the MRF. The IP access border
controller supports IP-level topology hiding for any voice media streams.
Specifically, the border gateway supports NAT functionality; always presents
its own IP address to the user; prevents ICMP Ping & ICMP Traceroute requests
from being forwarded across the gateway; and, resets TTL field in the IP
header.
Figure E.5.1: VoIP lawful interception for a terminating call with CC
interception at the MRF
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target are not
shown for simplification of the figure.
IRI interception is done at the S-CSCF. The CC interception is done at an MRF
that functions as the CC ICE.
The ADMF activates interception at the S-CSCF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI). The
S-CSCF dynamically triggers CC interception at the MRF for the call.
# E.6 Terminating Call to the Target with CC Interception at the IMS-AGW
Figure E.6 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target receives an incoming
call with IMS-AGW providing the CC interception.
Figure E.6: VoIP lawful interception for a terminating call with CC
interception at the IMS-AGW
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target are not
shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.6 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. However,
as specified in 7A, the IRI interception can also be done at the P-CSCF (not
shown in figure E.6). The CC interception is done at the IMS-AGW. The P-CSCF
sends the CC intercept trigger to the IMS-AGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI).
# E.7 Intra-CSP Forwarded Call with CC Interception at the PDN-GW/GGSN
## E.7.0 General
Figure E.7 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target receives an incoming
call with PDN-GW/GGSN providing the CC interception and the call is forwarded
to another IMS subscriber within the CSP's network.
Figure E.7: VoIP lawful interception for an intra-CSP forwarded call with CC
interception at the PDN-GW/GGSN
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target and to
the forwarded-to-party are not shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.7 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. In this
scenario, the IRI interception cannot occur in the P-CSCF since the P-CSCF
that provides the proxy functions to the target is not on the signalling path.
The CC interception is done at the PDN-GW/GGSN. The P-CSCF (that provides the
proxy functions to the forwarded-to-party) sends the CC intercept trigger to
the PDN-GW/GGSN.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI or TEL URI).
## E.7.1 Intra-CSP Forwarded Call with CC Interception at the MRF
Figure E.7.1 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target receives an incoming
call with the MRF providing the CC interception and the call is forwarded to
another IMS subscriber within the CSP's network. The S-CSCF provides the CC
Interception Triggering Function for the MRF.
The MRF is deployed in a network configuration with an IP border access
controller that serves to hide the presence of the MRF. The IP access border
controller supports IP-level topology hiding for any voice media streams.
Specifically, the border gateway supports NAT functionality; always presents
its own IP address to the user; prevents ICMP Ping & ICMP Traceroute requests
from being forwarded across the gateway; and, resets TTL field in the IP
header.
Figure E.7.1: VoIP lawful interception for an intra-CSP forwarded call with CC
interception at the MRF
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
P-CSCF, IMS-AGW, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the
target and to the forwarded-to-party are not shown for simplification of the
drawing.
Figure E.7.1 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF. The CC
interception is done at the MRF that functions as the CC ICE.
The ADMF activates interception at the S-CSCF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI or TEL URI). The S-CSCF
dynamically activates CC interception at the MRF.
# E.8 Intra-CSP Forwarded Call with CC Interception at the IMS-AGW
Figure E.8 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target receives an incoming
call with IMS-AGW providing the CC interception and the call is forwarded to
another IMS subscriber within the CSP's network.
Figure E.8: VoIP lawful interception for an intra-CSP forwarded call with CC
interception at the IMS-AGW
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target and to
the forwarded-to-party are not shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.8 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. In this
scenario, the IRI interception cannot occur in the P-CSCF since the P-CSCF
that provides the proxy functions to the target is not on the signalling path.
The CC interception is done at the IMS-AGW. The P-CSCF (that provides the
proxy functions to the forwarded-to-party) sends the CC intercept trigger to
the IMS-AGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI or TEL URI).
# E.9 Inter-CSP Forwarded Call to a CS Domain
Figure E.9 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target receives an incoming
call and the call is forwarded to a subscriber on the CS domain of another
CSP's network.
Figure E.9: VoIP lawful interception for an inter-CSP forwarded call to a CS
Domain
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target are not
shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.9 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. In this
scenario, the IRI interception cannot occur in the P-CSCF since the P-CSCF
that provides the proxy functions to the target is not on the signalling path.
The CC interception is done at the IM-MGW. The MGCF sends the CC intercept
trigger to the IM-MGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI or TEL URI).
# E.10 Inter-CSP Forwarded Call to an IMS Domain
Figure E.10 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target receives an incoming
call and the call is forwarded to a subscriber on the IMS domain of another
CSP's network.
Figure E.10: VoIP lawful interception for an inter-CSP forwarded call to an
IMS Domain
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target are not
shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.10 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. In this
scenario, the IRI interception cannot occur in the P-CSCF since the P-CSCF
that provides the proxy functions to the target is not on the signalling path.
The CC interception is done at the TrGW. IBCF sends the CC intercept trigger
to the TrGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI or TEL URI).
# E.11 Originating Call from the Target with IMS Roaming
Figure E.11 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target originates a call with
IMS roaming.
Figure E.11: VoIP lawful interception for an originating call with IMS Roaming
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is making a voice call and the called party can be within the same
CSP's network or in another CSP's network.
Figure E.11 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. The IRI
interception at the P-CSCF does not apply to this configuration due to the
fact that the P-CSCF resides at the visited CSP as a result of IMS roaming.
The CC interception is done at the TrGW. The I-BCF sends the CC intercept
trigger to the TrGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, TEL URI or IMEI).
# E.12 Terminating Call to the Target with IMS Roaming
Figure E.12 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when a target with IMS roaming
receives an incoming call.
Figure E.12: VoIP lawful interception for a terminating call with IMS Roaming
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target are not
shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.12 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS. The IRI
interception at the P-CSCF does not apply to this configuration due to the
fact that the P-CSCF resides at the visited CSP as a result of IMS roaming.
The CC interception is done at the TrGW. The I-BCF sends the CC intercept
trigger to the TrGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI, or TEL URI or IMEI).
# E.13 Intra-CSP Forwarded Call with IMS Roaming
Figure E.13 provides the lawful interception architecture to illustrate the
interception and delivery of IRI and CC, when an incoming call to a target
gets forwarded to another subscriber who is IMS roaming. The target may or may
not be IMS roaming.
Figure E.13: VoIP lawful interception for a intra-CSP forwarded call with IMS
Roaming
The cloud shown with the label \"voice services\" is to indicate that the
target is receiving an incoming voice call and the calling party can be within
the same CSP's network or in another CSP's network. The network nodes such as
I-CSCF, HSS involved in the handling of an incoming call to the target are not
shown for simplification of the drawing.
Figure E.13 shows that the IRI interception is done at S-CSCF or AS of the
target. In this scenario, the IRI interception cannot occur in the P-CSCF
since the P-CSCF that provides the proxy functions to the target is not on the
signalling path. Since the forwarded-to-party is IMS roaming, the CC
interception is done at the TrGW. IBCF sends the CC intercept trigger to the
TrGW.
The activation of intercept is done by the ADMF for IRI interception and CC
interception using the same target identity (SIP URI or TEL URI).
Note 5: If the target is IMS roaming, but not the forwarded-to-party, then the
CC interception for an intra-CSP forwarded call is done at the PDN-GW/GGSN (as
illustrated in Z.9) or IMS-AGW (as illustrated in Z.8).
###### ## Annex F (Informative) Examples of IMS-based VoIP Lawful Interception
Call Flows
# F.1 General Remarks
All the call flows illustrate that the CC delivery begins once the SDP offer
and answer is completed (i.e., when the media bearer is setup). In all the
call flows, the first reliable response is SIP 200 OK.
In all the call flows, the originating end of the call sends the SDP offer and
terminating end gives the SDP answer. Since, the first reliable response is
SIP 200 OK, the SDP answer is always given in the SIP 200 OK message.
The call flows assume that per clause 7.A, the IRI for VoIP is nothing but the
delivery encapsulated SIP messages. The call flows do not show the method used
for correlating the IRI with IRI and IRI with CC. It is presumed that those
are stage 3 details.
All the call flows assume the presence of a Voice Application Server (shown as
AS) that provides the voice services like digit translation, invoking the call
forwarding etc,
IRI in the visited CSP is intercepted by the P-CSCF and IRI in the home CSP is
intercepted by the S-CSCF.
The call flows show that CC interception is done at the IP-CAN (and it should
be interpreted to mean that the interception is done in the PDN-GW or GGSN
depending on the packet core network), or at the TrGW or at the IM-MGW. The
other possible CC interception options (e.g., IMS-AGW) are not shown.
Not all the functional elements are shown in the call flows. For example, the
call flows do not show I-CSCF, HSS, PCRF.
All the call flows show a summary of SIP messages that are delivered to the
LEA (not all SIP messages are shown). The term LEMF, used in some call flows,
means it is an equivalent of LEA.
For each call flow, references are required to identify MMTEL service that it
illustrates (for further study).

###### ## Annex G (Informative) Examples of CC Interception for Transcoded
Media
# G.1 Introduction
This annex provides some illustrative examples of media transcoding scenarios
and its implication on the CC interception.
In some situations, the media information known to the S-CSCF can be different
from the media information associated with the CC delivered to the LEMF. For
example, when transcoding is involved in the media path, the media information
(e.g., codec used) can change at the time transcoding is done and the S-CSCF
that normally provides the media information to the DF2 may not have the
knowledge of media information associated with the CC delivered to the LEMF.
In a particular implementation, the CC interception point may be chosen in
such a way that information associated with the intercepted CC always matches
to the information known to the IRI ICE (e.g., S-CSCF). But, there may some
deployment situations and/or regulations that may require having a need to
perform the CC interception at the other points with the information known to
S-CSCF not being aligned with the information associated with the intercepted
CC.
# G.2 CC Interception of transcoded media
The Figure G.2-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at the IMS-
AGW. In this example, the media is not encrypted.
Figure G.2-1: Transcoded Media
The Figure G.2-1 shows three different cases of CC interception points. In the
illustrated example, Codec 1 is associated with the media from the Target to
the Ingress point of IMS-AGW and Codec 2 is used from the Egress point of IMS-
AGW and beyond. Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the CC delivered to the
LEMF when that CC is intercepted at the PDN-GW or at the Ingress point of IMS-
AGW, and Codec 2 is associated with the media delivered to the LEMF when that
CC is intercepted at the Egress point of IMS-AGW.
The Codec 2 is included within the SDP of SIP messages handled at the S-CSCF
and therefore, if S-CSCF provides the codec information to the DF2 in all
cases, then there would be a misalignment with the codec information delivered
over the HI2 and codec information associated with the CC delivered over HI3
for Case 1 and Case 2.
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, the P-CSCF can send
either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. With the DF2 using the codec information
received from the P-CSCF for reporting purposes, the codec information
reported in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For case 3, the codec information
would be aligned irrespective of who sends that information to the DF2.
Therefore, for Case 3, P-CSCF sending the codec 2 information to the DF2 can
be an implementation alternative.
In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such that the CC
interception is always done at the Egress point of IMS-AGW (i.e., only Case
3), but because of some deployment situations and regulations, there may also
be a need to perform the CC interception at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW (Case
2) or at the PDN-GW (Case 1).
# G.3 CC Interception of transcoded media with e2ae encryption
The Figure G.3-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at IMS-AGW
with e2ae encryption. In this example, media is encrypted e2ae (i.e., between
the Target and the Ingress point of IMS-AGW). The CC is delivered to the LEMF
in a decrypted form.
Figure G.3-1: Transcoded Media with e2ae encryption
The Figure G.3-1 shows three different cases of CC interception points. In
this example, Codec 1 is associated with the media from the Target to the
Ingress point of IMS-AGW and Codec 2 is used from the Egress point of IMS-AGW
and beyond. Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the CC delivered to the LEMF
when that CC is intercepted at the PDN-GW or at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW,
and Codec 2 is associated with the media delivered to the LEMF when that CC is
intercepted at the Egress point of IMS-AGW. The Codec 2 is included within the
SDP of SIP messages handled at the S-CSCF and therefore, if S-CSCF provides
the codec information to the DF2 in all cases, then there would be a
misalignment with the codec information delivered over the HI2 and codec
information associated with the CC delivered over HI3 for Case 1 and Case 2.
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, the P-CSCF can send
either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. With the DF2 using the codec information
received from the P-CSCF for reporting purposes, the codec information
reported in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For case 3, the codec information
would be aligned irrespective of who sends that information to the DF2.
Therefore, for Case 3, P-CSCF sending the codec 2 information to the DF2 can
be an implementation alternative.
In this example, media is encrypted (with SDES keys in SDP) from Target to the
Ingress point of IMS-AGW and not encrypted from the Egress point of IMS-AGW
and beyond. Therefore, for Case 1 and Case 2, the DF2 has to provide the SDES
keys to the DF3 (see clause 7A.1.A) to perform the decryption. The S-CSCF does
not receive the SDES keys within the SDP of SIP messages. Therefore, P-CSCF
shall send the SDES Keys to the DF2 and the DF2 shall use that for its
handling (i.e., sending to the DF3). P-CSCF does not send any SDES Keys to the
DF2 for Case 3 since the CC is intercepted in the Egress point of IMS-AGW in a
decrypted form.
In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such that the CC
interception is always done at the Egress point of IMS-AGW (i.e., only Case
3), but because of some deployment situations and regulations, there may also
be a need to perform the CC interception at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW (Case
2) or at the PDN-GW (Case 1).
# G.4 CC Interception of transcoded media with e2e hop-by-hop encryption
The Figure G.4-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at IMS-AGW
with e2e hop-by-hop encryption. Different SDES keys are for the encryption.
Figure G.4-1: Transcoded Media with e2e encryption
The Figure G.4-1 shows three different cases of CC interception points. In
this example, Codec 1 is associated with the media from the Target to the
Ingress point of IMS-AGW and Codec 2 is used from Egress point of IMS-AGW and
beyond. Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the CC delivered to the LEMF
when that CC is intercepted at the PDN-GW or at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW,
and Codec 2 is associated with the media delivered to the LEMF when that CC is
intercepted at the Egress point of IMS-AGW. The Codec 2 is included within the
SDP of SIP messages handled at the S-CSCF and therefore, if S-CSCF provides
the codec information to the DF2 in all cases, then there would be a
misalignment with the codec information delivered over the HI2 and codec
information associated with the CC delivered over HI3 for Case 1 and Case 2.
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, the P-CSCF can send
either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. With the DF2 using the codec information
received from the P-CSCF for reporting purposes, the codec information
reported in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For case 3, the codec information
would be aligned irrespective of who sends that information to the DF2.
Therefore, for Case 3, P-CSCF sending the codec 2 information to the DF2 can
be an implementation alternative.
The media is encrypted (with SDES keys in SDP) from Target to the Ingress
point of IMS-AGW with SDES keyes-1 as the encryption keys and encrypted from
Egress point of IMS-AGW to the other end using SDES keys-2 as the encryption
keys. The S-CSCF is aware of only the SDES keys-2 as it sees that in the SDP
of the SIP messages. For Case 1 and Case 2, the P-CSCF shall provide the SDES
keys to the DF2. For Case 3, either of the two, S-CSCF or the P-CSCF, can send
the SDES keys to the DF2. DF2 has to use the SDES keys received from the
P-CSCF for its handling (i.e., sending it to DF3) to perform the decryption.
For Case 3, if the P-CSCF does not send the SDES Keys to the DF2, then the DF2
will use the SDES keys received from the S-CSCF for its handling.
In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such that the CC
interception is always done at the Egress point of IMS-AGW (i.e., only Case
3), but because of some deployment situations and regulations, there may also
be a need to perform the CC interception at the Ingress point of IMS-AGW (Case
2) or at the PDN-GW (Case 1).
# G.5 CC Interception of transcoded media at the TrGW
The Figure G.5-1 illustrates a case where the media is transcoded at TrGW. In
this example, the TrGW provides the transcoding. This scenario can be see when
an incoming call to the Target is forwarded (illustration assumes) or when
Target is IMS roaming.
Figure G.5-1: TrGW Transcoded Media
The Figure G.5-1 shows two different cases of CC interception points. In this
example, Codec 1 is associated with the media from the first Other Party
(e.g., calling party) to the Ingress point of TrGW and Codec 2 is used from
Egress point of TrGW to the second Other Party (e.g., forwarded-to-party).
Therefore, Codec 1 is associated with the CC delivered to the LEMF when that
CC is intercepted at Ingress point of TrGW and Codec 2 is associated with the
media delivered to the LEMF when that CC is intercepted at the Egress point of
TrGW. The Codec 1 is included within the SDP of SIP messages handled at the
S-CSCF and therefore, if S-CSCF provides that to the DF2 in both cases, there
would be a misalignment with the codec information delivered over the HI2 and
codec information associated with the CC delivered over HI3 for Case 2.
Depending on which case is used for the CC interception, the IBCF can send
either Codec 1 or Codec 2 to the DF2. With the DF2 using the codec information
received from the IBCF for reporting purposes, the codec information reported
in the HI2 and HI3 are now aligned. For Case 1 the codec information would be
aligned irrespective of who sends that information to the DF2. Therefore, for
Case 1, IBCF sending the codec 1 information to the DF2 can be an
implementation alternative.
In a scenario like this, an implementation can also be such that the CC
interception is always done at the Ingress point of TrGW (i.e., only Case 1),
but because of some deployment situations and/or regulations, there may also
be a need to perform the CC interception at the Egress point of TrGW as well.
