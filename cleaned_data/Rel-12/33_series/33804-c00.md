# Introduction
The present document aims to describe the re-use of non-UICC credentials, in
particular SIP Digest credentials, to provide security for access to
applications.
**The process of providing security in a certain context (application) based
on security already defined in some other context (e.g. 3GPP network access,
IMS) is often called bootstrapping of security. Bootstrapping enables Single
Sign-On (SSO) to applications using the security infrastructure already
present for e.g. 3GPP network access or IMS.**
**The Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA), as defined in 3GPP TS 33.220
[2], provides a bootstrapping mechanism, but it is limited to UICC-based
credentials. This means that other types of credentials, e.g. credentials used
for access to the Common IMS, cannot benefit from GBA to provide security for
the access to applications based on the security for network access or IMS.
3GPP TS 33.203 [4] defines, in particular, SIP Digest as an authentication
mechanism for access to the Common IMS core over a non-3GPP access network,
such as e.g. TISPAN NASS, or BBF, or cable access, or 3GPP2 access, or WiMAX
access. The credentials used with SIP Digest are shared secrets, or passwords,
stored in the HSS and in the terminal, or held by the user.** By means of
bootstrapping, GBA enables single sign-on to applications using the security
infrastructure already present for 3GPP network access or IMS. As an example,
GBA may be used for providing the security for the Ut interface used for self-
administration of IMS subscribers, cf. TS 33.141 [4].
This Technical Report **takes into consideration the benefits of SSO to
applications and the provision of cryptographic keys to terminals and
application servers, bootstrapped from IMS credentials that are available in
those scenarios where non-UICC based authentication mechanisms, in particular
SIP Digest, are used. SIP Digest is arguably the most commonly used
authentication mechanism in current IMS deployments. As an example, an
automated way for providing the security for the Ut interface, used for self-
administration of IMS subscribers, would be for the benefit of subscribers
using SIP Digest credentials.**
**The re-use of SIP Digest credentials for SSO to applications would bring the
benefit that there is no need to roll out a separate security infrastructure
for these applications. In this way, a SSO mechanism re-using SIP Digest
credentials would ease the introduction of new applications and services for
the operator whose subscribers use SIP Digest credentials in Common IMS.**
**Users would benefit from SSO as it reduces complexity for users when
accessing applications. Furthermore, operators could provide a chargeable
service to application providers. Charging users for the use applications
could be tied to the IMS subscription, although this is a matter for further
discussion.**
A similar need for the re-use of SIP Digest credentials for applications has
been recognized by ETSI TISPAN.
# 1 Scope
The objective of this study item is to provide reference material for IMS
based non-**UICC** based Single Sign On (SSO) to applications. This study item
targets to re-use the SIP Digest Credentials for SSO to applications by re-
using Common IMS and existing security elements. The study should describe
needed extension to enable a re-use of SIP Digest credentials in Common IMS
for providing security between a terminal and an application server. The study
aims to maximise the commonalities of the SSO_APS with the currently defined
application security approaches in 3GPP while efficiently satisfying the needs
of Common IMS deployments using SIP Digest.
The Technical Report targets to bring forth approaches with a security level
for access to applications using SSO_APS that is at least as good as that
provided by SIP Digest for Common IMS. This Technical Report is intended to be
used where the usage of UICC is not possible in a UICC-less environment. If
the usage of UICC is possible, then it is expected to used, but that is
outside the scope of the present study.
The scope of this Technical Report (Study Item Code SSO_APS) is restricted to
environments where the storage of credentials on a UICC is not mandated.

# 4 Description of SSO feature
Single Sign On (SSO) is a feature of an access control system for a range of
independent systems, which are affiliated. The systems often are application
services. This feature allows that the authentication process takes place
once, and the user gains access to all affiliated systems without the need to
authenticate again. The SSO subsystem provides the initial authentication and
provides authentication information to the Application Server which is part of
the SSO subsystem.
The SSO feature in this report is meant to
  * support the re-use of SIP Digest credentials as specified in TS 33.203, Annex N for initial authentication to the SSO subsystem for terminals that are not equipped with a UICC.
NOTE: The S-CSCF needs to be involved when SIP digest is performed in IMS as
specified in TS 33.203, Annex N. However, the client need not even to be
registered in IMS when SIP Digest credentials are re-used in the SSO
subsystem. This implies in particular that the S-CSCF is not involved when SIP
digest credentials are re-used in the SSO subsystem.
  * support interworking and exploit commonalities with existing SSO subsystem deployments e.g. OpenID, GBA, Liberty Alliance.
# 5 System architecture and assumptions
## 5.1 Overview of Existing Systems
### 5.1.1 Use of SIP Digest in Common IMS
SIP Digest is specified as an authentication method for Common IMS in TS
33.203 [3], Annex N. SIP Digest is allowed to be used under conditions
specified there. SIP Digest authentication and the requirements from TS 33.203
[3] Annex N, do not apply to access networks defined in 3GPP specifications.
The use of SIP Digest in Common IMS is a 3GPP-defined profile of HTTP Digest
as defined in RFC 2617 [5].
The IMS entities actively involved in providing SIP Digest in IMS are: the UE,
the S-CSCF, and the HSS. The UE plays the role of the HTTP client. The user
name from RFC 2617 [5] corresponds to the IMPI in IMS. The S-CSCF and the HSS
combined play the role of the HTTP server in RFC 2617. As the interplay of
S-CSCF and HSS is not a standard feature of HTTP Digest as used outside the
IMS world we quote the crucial text from 3GPP TS 33.203 [3] Annex N.2 here:
> _\"Upon receiving the SIP REGISTER the Sâ€‘CSCF shall use a SIP Digest
> Authentication Vector (SD-AV) for authenticating the user. If the Sâ€‘CSCF has
> no valid SD-AV for the specific IMPI, then the Sâ€‘CSCF shall send a request
> for SD-AV(s) to the HSS in CM1 where the number m of SD-AVs wanted is equal
> to 1. \"_ and
>
> _\"Upon receipt of a request from the Sâ€‘CSCF, the HSS sends one SD-AV to the
> Sâ€‘CSCF using CM2. The SD-AV consists of the qop (quality of protection)
> value, the authentication algorithm, realm, and a hash, called H(A1), of the
> IMPI, realm, and password. Refer to RFC 2617 [12] for additional information
> on the values in the authentication vector for SIP Digest based
> authentication. The qop value shall be set to \"auth\" since SIP Digest, as
> used in IMS, can only provide authentication, not message integrity.\"_ and
>
> _\"The S-CSCF generates a random nonce, stores H(A1) and the nonce against
> the IMPI, and then sends a SIP 401 Auth_Challenge i.e., an authentication
> challenge towards the UE including the nonce in SM4. It also includes the
> realm, qop and algorithm parameters. RFC 2617 [12] specifies how to populate
> the parameters of a 401 Auth_Challenge.\"_
According to TS 24.229 [10], the \"realm\" header field parameter is set to
the domain name of the home network.
As a general feature of the IMS security architecture, SIP-based access to IMS
application servers attached to the S-CSCF via the Isc interface does not
require a separate authentication in addition to the authentication performed
during IMS (re-)registration. This applies to all authentication mechanisms
supported in Common IMS, and thus consequently applies also when SIP Digest is
used as an authentication mechanism.
### 5.1.2 Uses of GBA
The GBA baseline architecture is described in TS 33.220 [2]. It can be
considered a Single Sign-On system in the sense that it re-uses credentials
already available on the user and the operator side for accessing the IMS
using IMS AKA for authentication (with the ISIM as the credential) or for
accessing a 3GPP-defined radio network using GSM AKA, UMTS AKA, or EPS AKA for
authentication (with the SIM or USIM as the credential).
Whether and how the GBA extensions specified in TSs 33.221 [16] and 33.222 [6]
could be applied when an UE is authenticated using HTTP Digest is assessed in
the evaluation sections of the solutions in clause 7.
In Figure 5.1-1 only the relation of GBA with IMS is shown. The relation with
3GPP-defined radio network is analogous.
It is important to note that GBA depends on IMS and 3GPP-defined radio
networks only in that GBA re-uses the corresponding credentials. The UE is not
required to be registered in IMS or the 3GPP-defined radio network while
employing GBA and hence does not rely on transport in IMS or transport
provided by 3GPP-defined radio networks.
Figure 5.1-1: Relation of GBA with the Common IMS
3GPP has also described how GBA can interwork with non-3GPP-defined SSO
systems, namely with Liberty Alliance systems in TR 33.980 [8] and with OpenID
in TR in 33.924 [9]. Here, only the architectural principles of the
interworking between GBA and Liberty Alliance are presented. Interworking
between GBA and OpenID follows similar principles.
From a high-level architectural point of view, basically two different
approaches are described in TR 33.980 [8]:
  * The Identity Provider (IdP) of Liberty Alliance is realized as a NAF in the sense of GBA;
  * The Identity Provider (IdP) of Liberty Alliance is realized as a BSF in the sense of GBA. In this case, the full GBA baseline architecture is not used.
The following two figures 5.1-2 and 5.1-3 depict these two different
approaches described in TR 33.980 [8].
Figure 5.1-2: Relation of GBA with the Common IMS and interworking with
Liberty Alliance collocating IdP and NAF
Figure 5.1-3: Relation of GBA with the Common IMS and interworking with
Liberty Alliance collocating IdP and BSF
From a high-level architectural point of view, basically two different
approaches are described in TR 33.924 [9]:
\- The authenticating agent (AA) and the browsing agent (BA) reside in the
same device;
The AA and the BA reside in different devices (split terminal scenario), in
that case some variants may occur depending on the availability of a local
link and on the triggering of the authentication procedure.
The following two figures 5.1-4 and 5.1-5 depict these two different
approaches described in TR 33.924 [9].
Figure 5.1-4: Relation of GBA with the Common IMS and interworking with OpenID
## 5.2 High-level architecture for SSO to applications for Common IMS based on
SIP Digest
Figure 5.2-1 shows the current use of SIP Digest in IMS on the left hand side.
On the right hand side, an application server (AS) is shown that is connected
to an SSO subsystem, which in turn is connected to the HSS.
HTTP is certainly the most commonly used protocol with application servers or
service providers. The study of other such protocols is not precluded,
however.
The SSO subsystem is to contain one or more functional elements that are
required to provide the SSO service to application servers based on SIP
Digest. It is one of the main tasks of this study to define this SSO
subsystem, i.e. to define the functional elements in the SSO subsystem, and
their interworking with each other and with the application server and the
HSS.
It is clearly shown in the figure that the HSS is the linking element between
the IMS subsystem and the SSO subsystem, which results from the fact that HSS
stores the permanent credentials used in both subsystems.
The right hand side shows three new reference points linking the UE and the
HSS to the SSO subsystem, as well as linking the UE and the AS. The reference
points SSOh and SSOb are required to provide the SSO functionality. The
reference point SSOa is SSO system specific and may be out of scope of 3GPP.
Figure 5.2-1: Relation of SIP Digest-based SSO with the Common IMS
## 5.3 Support for the Ut reference point
The Ut reference point is between a UE and an application server. TS 33.141
[4] defines the security for the Ut reference point, basically by referring
back to TS 33.222 [6]. And TS 33.222 uses GBA, as defined in TS 33.220 [2].
TS 24.623 [7] on \"Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access
Protocol (XCAP) over the Ut interface for Manipulating Supplementary
Services\" defines an additional security mechanism for the Ut reference
point, namely HTTP Digest according to RFC 2617 [5] as an alternative to the
use of GBA.
By the very definition of GBA, a form of single sign-on to the application
server over Ut is provided as the SIM/USIM/ISIM credentials are re-used in
GBA. The application server takes the role of a NAF in this case.
No such single sign-on is available when an UE is authenticated over Ut using
HTTP Digest according to TS 24.623 [7].
Whether and how single sign-on to an AS over the Ut reference point should be
provided when an UE is authenticated using HTTP Digest is assessed in the
evaluation sections of the solutions in clause 7.
Note that the user is able to manipulate his data on the application server
even when the user is not registered in IMS as the use of GBA with an ISIM
does not require the user to be registered in IMS, cf. clause 5.1.
There are two cases to consider, with and without an authentication proxy, as
shown in the following two figures taken from TS 24.623 [7].
{width="2.2597222222222224in" height="1.1555555555555554in"}
Figure 5.3-1: Ut interface
Quote from TS 24.623 [7]:
\"Authentication of the user with HTTP may take place directly at the AS, such
as in figure 1, or with the support of an Authentication Proxy, such as in
figure 2. The architecture for authentication is provided in 3GPP TS 33.222
[6].
NOTE: The Network Application Function (NAF) can be an AS.\"

Figure 5.3-2: Authentication proxy in the Ut interface path
## 5.4 Interworking with Liberty Alliance
The SSO subsystem under study is meant to provide some form of interworking
with, or support for, other SSO systems, notably Liberty Alliance, cf. this
clause, and OpenID, cf. clause 5.5.
Interworking of GBA with Liberty Alliance systems is described in TR 33.980
[8]. It may be useful to take the approaches in TR 33.980 [8] into account
when studying the interworking of the SIP Digest-based SSO subsystem defined
in this TR with Liberty Alliance, cf. clause 5.1.2. The results of the study
shall not be bound by the approaches taken in TR 33.980 [8] in any way,
however.
A high-level architecture for interworking of SIP Digest-based SSO with
Liberty Alliance that takes into account the baseline architecture from clause
5.2 is shown in Figure 5.4-1. The interfaces between the UE and the SP and the
SP and the IdP are out of scope of 3GPP.
It should be noted that the two different approaches in TR 33.980 [8] for
interworking between GBA and Liberty Alliance, cf. clause 5.1.2, map to the
same high-level architecture for the SIP-Digest based SSO case at this level
of granularity. This is so because the SIP-Digest based SSO subsystem shows no
substructure at this level of granularity with roles equivalent to BSF and
NAF.
Figure 5.4-1: Relation of SIP Digest-based SSO with the Common IMS and
interworking with Liberty Alliance
## 5.5 Interworking with OpenId
Interworking with OpenID is quite analogous with interworking with Liberty
Alliance. The SSO subsystem under study is meant to provide some form of
interworking with or support also for, other SSO systems, notably Liberty
Alliance, cf. previous clause 5.4.
A high-level architecture for interworking of SIP Digest-based SSO with OpenID
that takes into account the baseline architecture from clause 5.2 are shown in
Figure 5.5-1 and 5.5-2. The
  * Interface between the UE and the RP and the
  * Interface between RP and the OP
are out of scope of 3GPP and based on the OpenID protocols.
Interworking of GBA with OpenID systems is described in TR 33.924 [9]. It may
be useful to take the approaches in TR 33.924 into account when studying the
interworking of the SIP Digest-based SSO subsystem defined in this TR with
OpenID, cf. clause 5.1.2. The results of the study shall not be bound by the
approaches taken in TR 33.924 in any way, however.
TR 33.924 [9] describes two basic scenarios, in the first one the user browses
and authenticates with the same device (c.f. 5.5-1) and in the second one the
authentication agent (AA) and the browsing agent (BA) are in different
entities. The second split terminal scenario has also several variants
depending on the actual connection from the BA to the AA and on which entity
triggers the authentication.
NOTE: In both figures below the SSOa interface is based on OpenID protocols
and uses HTTPS.
Figure 5.5-1: Relation of SIP Digest-based SSO with the Common IMS and
interworking with OpenID
Figure 5.5.-2 covers all the split terminal variants outlined in TR 33.924
[9], but it should be noted that the connection between the BA and AA might
not be present depending on the variant.

interworking with OpenID for the split terminal scenarios
# 6 Security requirements
\- The design of a SIP Digest-based SSO system shall allow for the possibility
of interworking with a larger range of SSO providers.
\- It shall be ensured that the compromise of one SSO service shall not
compromise the security of the IMS core or of another SSO service, or an
application server.
\- It shall be ensured that the compromise of application server or an
external SSO server shall not compromise the security of the SSO subsystem.
\- Information leakage of the permanent secrets stored in the HSS/HLR due to
credential usage for SSO that are available to application servers or entities
outside the operator\'s control shall be prevented.
\- The SIP Digest-based SSO service should allow indicating to the application
server the strength of the authentication method used.
\- IMS core network nodes shall not be modified for supporting the SIP Digest-
based SSO service.
\- Identity providers and service providers in SSO deployments that were not
designed by 3GPP should not need to support additional protocols, besides the
protocols already specified for them.
\- The approach to utilize SIP Digest authentication for SSO shall maximize
commonalities with the already defined 3GPP approaches for interworking with
non-3GPP-defined SSO systems as described in TR 33.980 and TR 33.924.
\- The operator should be able to control the security level of the SSO
system, either by operating the SSO system themselves or by contractual
agreements with trusted partners.
\- Where user privacy is required, the design of a SIP Digest based SSO system
should not allow affiliated non-IMS domain services drawing conclusions about
IMS domain identities, e.g., the SSO subsystem should hide IMPIs from
application services.
\- Any solution should take into account the following design guidelines for
HSS-related security:
\- The number of different types of interfaces to the HSS should be minimized
in order to keep the complexity of the HSS low. This applies in particular to
interfaces over which authentication vectors are retrieved from the HSS as
they are highly security-critical.
\- In order to minimize any security risks due to excessive use/abuse of
authentication vectors, as well as any performance impact to HSS, the overall
number of authentication vectors requested from the authentication centre as
well as the number of requests should be kept low. Mechanisms which make
economical use of authentication vectors should be preferred. In particular,
mechanisms which avoid bursts in authentication vector requests should be
preferred.
\- The core network load should be minimized and also the SSO subsystem should
be designed in an efficient manner to minimize UE authentication and CN
interaction to avoid that SSO subsystem is the bottleneck of the application
service or other SSO systems.
\- Any SSO solution should allow an operator to enforce the condition
specified in Annex N of TS 33.203 [3] that SIP Digest authentication shall not
apply to access networks defined in 3GPP specifications. According to Annex P
of TS 33.203 [3], the enforcement mechanisms may involve implementation-
dependent steps.
# 7 Solutions
## 7.1 General
This sub clause provides a solution which describes the re-usage of non-UICC
credentials to provide security for the access to applications bases on SIP
Digest authentication mechanism.
In the High-level architecture for SSO to applications for Common IMS based on
SIP Digest, the HSS is the linking element between the IMS subsystem and the
SSO subsystem, which results from the fact that HSS stores the permanent
credentials used in both subsystems. The credentials used with SIP Digest in
the non-UICC are shared secrets or passwords stored in the HSS and in the
terminal, or held by the user.
The solution also provides mutual authentication between the application
server and the UE. It defines functional elements in the SSO subsystem and
their interworking with each other and with the application server and the
HSS. These functional elements can provide the SSO service to application
servers based on SIP Digest in the UICC-less environment. After the
authentication procedure, the UE shares secrets respectively with the SSO and
the RP, the SIP Digest credentials can be reused in Common IMS for providing
security between a terminal and an application server.
Besides, this solution also supports interworking and exploits commonalities
with existing SSO subsystem deployments e.g. OpenID, GBA, Liberty Alliance. It
also improves user security by engaging a user-trusted operator in the access
control to the applications.
  1. Solution 1 -- SIP Digest based GBA solution \-------------------------------------------
    1. ### Solution 1 -- Architecture for SIP Digest based GBA (GBA_Digest)
In this solution, it is described how SIP Digest authentication can be
integrated into the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) as defined in TS
33.220 [2]. SIP Digest Authentication in Common IMS is a 3GPP-defined profile
of HTTP Digest as defined in RFC 2617 [5].
GBA Digest is an extension of the GBA version currently defined in TS 33.220
[2]. In GBA_Digest, SIP Digest credentials, such as shared secret or password,
are re-used instead of the credentials stored in the SIM, USIM or ISIM for
authentication.
In GBA_Digest, the function of BSF is extended based on the BSF in TS 33.220
[2].
The architecture of GBA_Digest is described in Figure 7.2-1. For the purpose
of GBA_Digest the function of the BSF is extended compared to the BSF as
currently defined in TS 33.220 [2].
Figure 7.2-1 Architecture of GBA_Digest
Reference points:
\- The Ua and Zn [11] interface can be used as defined in TS 33.220, with the
extensions for the initiation of bootstrapping mentioned at the start of
clause 7.2.2 and for the Zn interface for indications relating to SIP Digest
credentials towards the end of clause 7.2.2. The Ua protocol is application
specific. It could use e.g. HTTPS, as defined in TS 33.222 [6]. The
bootstrapping procedure over the Ub reference point is defined below. It
extends the procedure over Ub defined in the main body of TS 33.220 in a way
similar to 2G GBA, defined in Annex I of TS 33.220. There is mutual
authentication between UE and BSF based on the SIP Digest credential used in
the IMS. In addition, there is BSF-to-UE authentication by means of TLS.
\- The BSF retrieves a SIP Digest authentication vector (SD-AV ) and, if
available, the GUSS from the HSS by using an extended Zh interface.
In reference to chapter 5, the SSO Subsystem consists out of the GBA
Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) with SIP digest specific enhancements and
the NAF functionality.
NOTE 1: GBA only provides an application-specific shared secret, the so-called
NAF keys. It is not in itself an authentication mechanism for applications.
The derivation of Ks_NAF for GBA_Digest is defined at the end of clause 7.2.2.
Clause 7.2.3 explains how Ks_NAF can be used for authentication between a UE
and an identity provider (IdP) in an existing Single Sign-On system, such as
OpenID or Liberty Alliance.
### 7.2.2 SIP Digest based GBA (GBA_Digest) bootstrapping procedure and its
use
We assume that the UE contacts the NAF and the NAF indicates to the UE that it
should use GBA. The NAF demands that bootstrapping is required and gives an
indication as described, for the general case, in clause 4.5.1 \'Initiation of
bootstrapping\' of TS 33.220 [2] and, for the special case of an HTTPS-based
Ua interface, in clause 5.3 of TS 33.222 [6] and clause 5.2.4 of TS 24.109
[12].
For the special case of an HTTPS-based Ua interface, the messaging contents
over Ua reference point to indicate GBA_Digest are described as follows:
1) The request for service message from the UE to the NAF---A new \"product\"
token to the \"User Agent\" header will indicate that the UE requests the use
of GBA_Digest by including a static string \"3gpp-gba-sip-digest\".
2) The code 401 \"Unauthorized\" response to the request for service (NAF to
UE) contains the WWW-Authenticate header---A new prefix \"3GPP-bootstrapping-
gba-sip-digest@\" in the \"realm\" attribute in the header will indicate that
the UE is allowed to perform non-UICC SIP Digest GBA. If the 401
\"Unauthorized\" response received by the UE does not include an indication
with this new prefix, the UE shall not use GBA_Digest.
This indication shall trigger the UE to run GBA_Digest bootstrapping procedure
over the Ub interface (suitably extended for the purposes of GBA_Digest) as is
described below:
Figure 7.2-2 GBA_Digest bootstrapping procedure
NOTE 1: The figure above only shows an example flow for visualization and not
all details are included.
**Step 0:**
The UE and the BSF establish a TLS tunnel with server authentication using a
server certificate. The use of TLS message integrity is mandatory, while the
use of TLS encryption is optional. All further messages between the BSF and UE
are sent through this tunnel.
NOTE 2: TLS encryption can be useful for protecting the user identity privacy
when the TMPI mechanism defined in TS 33.220 [2] is not used.
**Step 1:**
In this HTTP request message from the UE to the BSF, the UE shall include
Authorization header containing the IMPI and a token indicating the use of
GBA_Digest.
NOTE 3: It should be noted that it would have been possible to select an
alternative information flow as follows: the UE would not convey its IMPI to
the BSF in step 1 but only in the second GET request (step 5). In this case
the AV request / response exchange between BSF and HSS would be deferred,
until this second GET request was received by the BSF. But the information
flow presented here was preferred because it maximizes commonality with GBA,
as defined in TS 33.220 [2]. This would be possible in GBA_Digest, in contrast
to GBA, as the nonce serving as a challenge in GBA_Digest is generated by the
BSF while the challenge RAND \| AUTN in GBA has to be generated by the HSS.
The delayed approach would maximize the similarities with HTTP Digest as used
on the web. Note that since this flow requires the realm to be pre-configured
in the BSF, all users served by the BSF must use identical realm values in the
HSS.
NOTE 4: The token is only required for GBA_Digest, not for AKA-based GBA
variants already defined in TS 33.220 [2]. This ensures backward
compatibility.
**Step 2:**
The BSF requests a SIP Digest Authentication Vector (SD_AV) and, optionally,
inserts into the request the timestamp of the locally stored GUSS for this
user, if such is available.
NOTE 5: If there is no timestamp the HSS will send the GUSS for this user if
it exists if there is a timestamp, then the HSS will only send the GUSS if it
is more recent.
The SD-AV is defined in TS 33.203 [3] Annex N. The username field in the
Multimedia Auth Request contains the IMPI. If a token indicating the use of
GBA_Digest was received by the BSF in step 1 then the BSF shall indicate in
the Multimedia Auth Request that the requested Authentication Vectors are for
SIP Digest credentials.
NOTE 5: If no token indicating the use of GBA_Digest was received by the BSF
in step 1 then the BSF knows that the subscription is AKA-based, but the BSF
may not be able to determine at this point whether the subscription type is 2G
or 3G, hence the authentication scheme is not indicated in the Multimedia Auth
Request. Note that the subscription type can be either 2G or 3G, but not both.
**Step 3:**
The HSS retrieves the SIP Digest authentication vector SD-AV corresponding to
the IMPI and sends it to the BSF in a Multimedia Auth Answer. The GUSS is only
returned when requested by the BSF, supported by the HSS, and the timestamp in
the BSF indicates that the one in the HSS is fresher.
The qop value shall be set to \"auth\".
NOTE 6: The additional protection afforded by qop set to \"auth-int\" is not
needed due to the fact that the messages exchanged between UE and BSF run
inside a TLS tunnel. The use of qop set to \"auth\" is less complex.
**Step 4:**
In the 401 response from the BSF to the UE, the BSF shall include parameters
to WWW-Authenticate header as specified in RFC 2617 [5].
The realm, qop, and algorithm are provided in the SD-AV and the
nonce=base64encode(16 byte random value) is generated by the BSF.
The BSF sends the challenge to the UE in an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response.The
WWW-Authenticate header is included in the HTTP 401 Unauthorized response.
**Step 5:**
When responding to a challenge from the BSF, the UE generates a cnonce
randomly, and calculates the response RESP. The RESP is put into the
Authorization header and sent back to the BSF in the GET request.
RESP is computed as a Digest-response according to RFC 2617 [5] (HTTP Digest)
from the most recent GBA_Digest challenge and a password \'passwd\' that is
generated as follows:
> passwd = KDF (H(A1), \"GBA_Digest_RESP\", TLS_MK_Extr)
where H(A1) is the hash of the following three parameters: the user name and
password used by the user in IMS for SIP Digest according to TS 33.203, Annex
N, and the realm, cf. also RFC 2617 [5]. \"GBA_Digest_RESP\" is a character
string. TLS_MK_Extr is extracted from the TLS master key according to RFC5705
[15] with the optional context value being omitted and the label set to
\"EXPORTER_GBA_Digest\", and the length set equal to the length of the TLS
master secret (48 bytes). KDF is the key derivation function as specified in
Annex B in TS 33.220 [2].
NOTE 7: A cautionary note on notation: According to RFC 2617 [5], the
computation of RESP from the password \'passwd\' defined above entails again a
parameter called H(A1). This parameter will differ from the value of H(A1)
that is input to the above formula because the passwords from which these two
H(A1) values are derived differ. But no new notation is deemed necessary here
as the notation H(A1), when H(A1) is derived from \'passwd\', is not
explicitely used in the text of the present document.
**Step 6:**
Upon receiving a GET request carrying the authentication response RESP, the
BSF checks that the expected RESP (calculated by the BSF in the same way as
the UE in step 5) matches the received RESP. If the check is successful then
the user has been authenticated.
The BSF then derives Ks as follows:
> Ks = KDF (H(A1), \"GBA_Digest_Ks\", TLS_MK_Extr, RESP)
where H(A1), RESP, and TLS_MK_Extr are defined as in step 5, and
\"GBA_Digest_Ks\" is a character string.
The BSF generates the bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) for the
IMPI and stores the tuple \. The B-TID shall be constructed in
the format of a NAI by taking the nonce from step 4, and the BSF server name,
i.e. nonce\@BSF_server_domain_name.
The BSF sends 200 OK response to the UE to indicate the success of the
authentication.
In this message from the BSF to the UE, the BSF shall include bootstrapping
transaction identifier (B-TID) and the key lifetime in an XML document in the
response payload. The BSF may also include additional server specific data to
the XML document.
An Authentication-Info header according to RFC 2617 [5] shall be included into
the 200 OK response.
The UE aborts the procedure if the server authentication according to [5]
fails. Otherwise, the UE derives Ks in the same way as the BSF did above.
NOTE 8: The B-TID construction above is almost identical to the one used in TS
33.220 [2]. The difference is that in TS 33.220 [2] the username part is
constructed from the (base64 encoded) RAND value.
After successful bootstrapping procedure the UE and the BSF contain the key Ks
and the B-TID. In addition, the BSF stores an indication of the underlying
security quality, i.e. SIP Digest, like it is doing for 2G GBA. The key Ks is
then used in the BSF and in the UE to derive NAF specific key(s) Ks_NAF to
secure Ua reference points in the following way:
\- Ks_NAF is computed as Ks_NAF = KDF (Ks, \"gba-digest\", nonce, IMPI,
NAF_Id), where KDF is the key derivation function as specified in Annex B of
TS 33.220 [2], and the input parameters consist of the user\'s IMPI, the
NAF_Id and \'nonce\'. \'nonce\' is the nonce that was used for computing the
RESP that was input to the derivation of Ks . The NAF_Id is constructed as in
TS 33.220 [2], clause 4.5.2. The \"gba-digest\" parameter is a static
character string.
NOTE 9: The above derivation of Ks_NAF is analagous to the derivation in TS
33.220 [2], clause 4.5.2, step 9 and the same KDF can be utilized.
When the BSF delivers a Ks_NAF to a NAF it shall indicate that this Ks_NAF was
derived from SIP Digest credentials. The BSF shall deliver a Ks_NAF to the NAF
only after the NAF has indicated its willingness to accept SIP Digest
credentials.
The KDF shall be implemented in the BSF and in the terminal.
The UE and the BSF shall store the key Ks with the associated B-TID and the
nonce for further use, until the key Ks is updated or deleted.
### 7.2.3 Interworking of SIP digest based GBA with other SSO systems
The approach outlined above for the non-UICC based GBA solution could
interwork with existing SSO subsystems, such as OpenID and Liberty Alliance.
The Ks_NAF derived from the Ks by the UE and the BSF can be used for
authentication between UE and Identity Provider in OpenID as outlined in TR
33.924 or for Liberty Interworking as outlined in TR 33.980 [8]. Also for
other services the derived Ks_NAF can be used.
The following figures 7.2-3 depict the interworking between non-UICC based
GBA, IMS subsystem and Liberty Alliance.
Figure 7.2-3 interworking with Liberty Alliance
NOTE: The figure 7.2.-3 contains a potential set-up where the BSF supports an
IdP/NAF, but also delivers NAF specific keys directly to an application
server, which is not part of the service supported by the IdP.
### 7.2.4 Evaluation
**Compatibility with other GBA-related specifications:**
GBA_Digest can be used with TSs 33.221 [16] and 33.222 [6] because GBA_Digest
provides as output a key Ks_NAF (cf. clause 7.2.3) and an identifier B-TID
(cf. clause 7.2.2) as well as information in the BSF about the underlying
security quality, i.e. SIP digest authentication, (cf. clause 7.2.2). This is
the input required for TSs 33.221 [16] and 33.222 [6] to become applicable.
Single sign-on to an AS over the Ut reference point can, hence, also be
provided using GBA_Digest, as TS 33.141 [4] defines the security for the Ut
reference point by referring back to TS 33.222 [6].
**Advantages of solution 1:**
The non-UICC based GBA solution has the following advantages:
\- Re-use of the SIP Digest subscriber credentials stored in HSS.
\- Re-use of Ua interface and Zn interface (with adding one field for
indicating GBA_Digest) as specified in TS 33.220 [2].
\- Support for the existing GBA based applications.
\- Enhanced security over plain SIP Digest (without TLS)
\- Seamless evolution and migration to GBA variants using a SIM, USIM, or ISIM
possible on the network side when clients are upgraded to contain a UICC
**Security considerations on solution 1:**
_The role of TLS:_
The use of TLS in GBA_Digest provides the following advantages:
\- Parameters derived from the SIP Digest password and exchanged between UE
and BSF can be observed by an attacker when the TLS connection is not
encrypted. In order to make it much more difficult for the attacker to infer
(e.g. by dictionary codebook attacks) the SIP Digest password from the
observed parameters GBA_Digest was constructed such that the computation of
these parameters additionally requires the knowledge of the TLS master key.\ \
It is true that the attacker could just as well attempt to infer the SIP
Digest password from parameters exchanged during a SIP Digest run in IMS, as
defined in TS 33.203 [3] Annex N. However, this is not possible in IMS when
these parameters are sent over an encrypted TLS connection, as defined in TS
33.203 [3] Annex O. In order to achieve at least the same the level of
protection against password cracking in GBA_Digest as that afforded in IMS by
TS 33.203 [3] Annex O, the TLS master key is used in the construction of the
GBA_Digest parameters.
_\- Channel binding and dictionary attacks_ : Even if an attacker could obtain
a forged certificate, under the name of the BSF and with the corresponding
private key known to him, the use of channel binding types as in RFC 5929 [18]
would not further strengthen the protection against dictionary attacks for the
following reason: the UE first sends an Authorization header using the
password and a server-selected nonce as input before receiving any information
from the server that would allow the UE to authenticate the server in addition
to the TLS server authentication (which the UE could not rely on as, by
assumption, there is a forged TLS server certificate). Therefore, an attacker
with a forged TLS server certificate at his disposal could obtain data from
the UE derived from parameters that are all known to the attacker with the
exception of the long-time password itself and use this data for dictionary
attacks, even when channel binding was used.
\- But it should be noted that the use of TLS differs between 2G GBA and
GBA_Digest: it is not required in GBA_Digest to use TLS with encryption, cf.
clause 7.2.2, step 0. Mandating TLS encryption was avoided as it might
conflict with national regulation.
\- TLS provides \'perfect forward secrecy\' when used with suitable cipher
suites. This property means that, when a compromise of a permanent secret has
occurred, session keys agreed prior to the time of the compromise cannot be
reconstructed by the attacker knowing the permanent secret. As the TLS master
key is input to the computation of the key Ks resulting from a GBA_Digest run
this property is inherited by GBA_Digest. This property is especially
desirable for a password-based scheme as passwords are more prone to
compromise than UICC-based credentials.
\- The role of TLS in protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks is
described below.
_Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks:_
Two types of man-in-the-middle attacks need to be considered:
> _Man-in-the-middle attacks through BSF impersonation_
>
> \- An attacker could set up a server and trick a terminal into believing
> that it was talking to a genuine BSF and sending the authentication response
> to the attacker\'s server. The attacker could then use this response to
> impersonate the user towards the genuine BSF.
>
> \- This can be prevented by requiring the use of TLS between UE and BSF and
> ensuring that the UE authenticates the TLS server before sending anything
> over the TLS connection. This authentication is provided by TLS server
> certificates and the fact that the UE checks as part of the authentication
> process that the name in the certificate coincides with the BSF name
> configured in the UE.
>
> \- _Channel binding and integrity protection:_ If an attacker could obtain a

> another TLS connection between the mitm and the BSF. Assumptions for this
> attack to work include that the TLS cipher suite includes key transport for
> the TLS handshake and that some protocol interleaving is used to establish
> the two TLS connections.\ However, the mitm could still not do any harm as
> he could not modify the message body of the response from the BSF due to the
> integrity protection afforded by HTTP Digest through qop=auth-int: the mitm
> would then act as a mere pass-through instance, and the UE could still rest
> assured that the data (Ks lifetime, B-TID) were indeed sent by the BSF. On
> the other hand, if the mitm was also able to forge the message
> authentication code provided by HTTP Digest then the attacker would not need
> to perform the -- rather tricky -- mitm attack at all. The attacker could

> using the forged TLS server certificate (that the attacker has at his
> disposal by assumption). Therefore, the use of channel binding types as in
> RFC 5929[18] would enable the UE to detect the mitm, but it would not
> strengthen the integrity-protected provision of data by the BSF to the UE.
>
> \- _Channel binding and encryption:_ Note that the same argument as for
> channel binding and integrity protection would not apply to channel binding
> and encryption as HTTP Digest only provides integrity, not encryption. So, a
> mitm with a forged BSF certificate performing the mitm attack described

> M.6.3, which reads "TLS encryption can be useful for protecting the user
> identity privacy when the TMPI mechanism defined in the present document is
> not used." But the UE would send the IMPI before it could detect the
> presence of the mitm through channel binding, so the only thing channel
> binding could prevent was that the mitm could link IMPI and B-TID. But, when

In the SSO solution described in 7.2. the BSF server has to support the
following 3GPP specific functionalities:
\- Interface to HSS to obtain the SD-AV, user profile and related attributes
\- Storage and handling of data related to (nonce, H(A1))
## Solution 2 -- SIP Digest based Authentication and Lightweight Security

### 7.3.1 Architecture and Interworking for SDALS
#### 7.3.1.1 Solution 2 -- High-level architecture

#### 7.3.1.2 Interworking of SDALS (solution 2) with other SSO systems
##### 7.3.1.2.1 Background
The solution of SDALS has the following advantages:
The approach outline above for the non-UICC solution could provide some forms
of interworking with other existing SSO subsystem, notably OpenID and Liberty
Alliance.
##### 7.3.1.2.2 Co-hosting AS and OP
The architecture for interworking of the SDALS with OpenID that co-hosts AS
and OP, which takes into account the baseline architecture from clause 7.3.1.1
is shown in Figure 7.3-2. It makes the Application Server (AS) in the SSO
subsystem and the OpenID Provider (OP) in the OpenID as an entity, and the
interface between the UE and the RP and the interface between RP and the OP
are out of scope of 3GPP and based on the OpenID protocols.
Figure 7.3-2: Interworking with OpenID that co-hosts AS and OP
##### 7.3.1.2.3 Co-hosting AS and IdP (Liberty Alliance)
Interworking with Liberty Alliance which co-hosts AS and IdP (Liberty
Alliance) is quite analogous with interworking with OpenID that co-hosts AS
and OP.
The approach outline above for the non-UICC solution could provide some forms
of interworking with other existing SSO subsystem , Interworking of GBA with
Liberty Alliance systems is described in TR 33.980 [8]. It may be useful to
take the approaches in TR 33.980 [8] into account when studying the
interworking of the SIP Digest-based SSO subsystem defined in this TR with
Liberty Alliance. The results of the study shall not be bound by the
approaches taken in TR 33.980 [8] in any way, however.

of interworking with Liberty Alliance, The architecture for interworking of
the SDALS with Liberty Alliance that co-hosts AS and IdP (Liberty Alliance),
which takes into account the baseline architecture from clause 7.3.1.1 is
shown in Figure 7.3-3. It makes the Application Server (AS) in the SSO
subsystem and the Identity Provider (L_IdP) in the Liberty Alliance as an
entity. The interface between the UE and the SP, and the interface between the
SP and the L_IdP are out of scope of 3GPP, both of them are based on the
Liberty Alliance protocols.

### 7.3.2 Message Flows for Solution 2 SDALS
#### 7.3.2.1 Basic message flow
Editor\'s Note: The solution above and below have some overlap and need to be
sorted out, how is for further study.
The solution realizes a SSO function that is available when an IMS UE is
authenticated over SIP Digest authentication mechanism. Figure 7.3-5 shows the
message flow of the authentication process to realize SIP Digest-based SSO
with the Common IMS in the UICC-less environment.
Figure 7.3-5 SDALS Procedure
The basic steps are as follows:
1) The UE issues a service request to RP without user identifier.
2) The RP sends a response to the UE the RP Authentication Request. The
response includes the RP identifier (RP_credential). The RP identifier may be
FQDN.
3) The UE sends a HTTP request to the IdP known by the UE with the UE
authentication request and RP Authentication Request. The request includes the
UE identifier (U_credential). The UE identifier may be IMPI or TMPI.
NOTE 1: The address of the IdP (SSO Server) can be configured in UE, or, can
be generated by UE based on UE identifier, e.g. if the user identifier is
user_name\@domain, then the address of IdP (SSO Server) can be idp_sso.domain.
4) The IdP authenticates the RP based on the RP_credential and generates
related authentication result RP_Auth. According to the U_credential, the IdP
first checks whether there is already a shared secret _K_ 0 between the UE and
IdP. If _K_ 0 exists, the process jumps to step 11; otherwise, the process
goes on to the next step.
NOTE2: The RP and the IdP shall have a shared secret (_K_ r,i) using existing
mechanism, for example, using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol or pre-
shared secret, the details of shared key establishment between the RP and IdP
are out of scope. With this shared secret the IdP can sign subsequent messages
and the RP can verify those messages.
5) The IdP sends authentication request to the HSS, it then obtains the SIP
Digest authentication vector SD-AV and the user profile based on the
U_credential from the HSS. The SD-AV consists of the qop (quality of
protection) value, the authentication algorithm, realm, and a hash, called H
(A1), of the U_credential, realm, and password. Refer to RFC 2617[5] for
additional information on the values in the authentication vector for SIP
Digest based authentication. In a multiple HSS environment, the IdP may have
to obtain the address of the HSS where the UE is stored by querying the SLF.
6) The IdP generates a random nonce, stores H(A1) and the nonce against the
U_credential.
7) The IdP sends a 401 Auth_Challenge to the UE which includes the nonce, the
realm, qop, algorithm and U_credential.
8) Upon receiving the challenge, the UE generates a random cnonce and the
H(A1), and then generates the shared secret _K_ 0 based on the H(A1), the
cnonce, etc. It then uses the cnonce as well as parameters provided in the 401
Auth_Challenge such as nonce, U_credential and qop to calculate an
authentication response according to RFC 2617[5].
9) The UE sends a response to the IdP which includes the cnonce, the nonce,
the response, the realm, the U_credential, qop, algorithm, nonce-count and
digest-url.
10) Upon receiving the response, the IdP uses the previously stored nonce to
check against the nonce included in the response. If the check is successful,
the IdP calculates the expected response (Xresponse) using the previously
stored H (A1) and the nonce together with other parameters contained in the
response (e.g.cnonce, nonce-count, qop, as specified in RFC 2617[5]) and uses
this to check against the response sent by the UE. If the check is successful,
the authentication of the UE is succeeded, else the authentication fails. If
the UE is successfully authenticated, the IdP calculates the value of rspauth
based on SIP Digest as specified in RFC 2617 [5] and generates the shared
secret K0 based on the H(A1), the cnonce, etc.
11) The IdP knows the User authentication conclusion (UE_Auth); and then the
IdP generates a random nonce1 and generates a shared secret _K_ 1 based on _K_
0 and nonce1. The IdP encrypts the nonce1 and RP_Auth using _K_ 0, i.e. E _K_
0(nonce1,RP_Auth); and encrypts the _K_ 1 and UE_Auth using _K_ r,i, i.e. E
_K_ r,i (_K_ 1,UE_Auth).
12) The IdP sends the UE an message including E _K_ 0(nonce1,RP_Auth) and E
_K_ r,i (_K_ 1,UE_Auth) ,the value of rspauth with redirection.
13) The UE decrypts the E _K_ 0(nonce1,RP_Auth) and then obtains RP_Auth and
nonce1. Based on the RP_Auth the UE knows the legitimacy of the requested RP.
If the authentication result indicates that the RP is not valid, the UE will
stop visiting the RP. The UE calculates the rspauth in the same way as the IdP
did in step 9, and uses it to check against the rspauth sent by the IdP. If
the check is successful, the authentication of the Network is succeeded, else
the authentication fails. If the Network is successfully authenticated, and
then the UE will generates the shared secret _K_ 1 based on _K_ 0, nonce1.
14) The message sent by the IdP is redirected to the RP including E _K_ r,i
(_K_ 1,UE_Auth).
15) The RP decrypts the E _K_ r,i (_K_ 1,UE_Auth), and obtains UE_Auth and _K_
1.
16) After verifying the UE_Auth, the RP generates authorization information
for the UE, i.e. UE_Author and encrypts UE_Author using _K_ 1 E
_K1_(UE_Author).
17) The RP notifies the UE about the authorization information.
18) The UE decrypts the E _K1_(UE_Author) and then accesses to the requested
service.
NOTE 3: The last 3 steps 16, 17 and 18 are application specific, they are
optional steps and not required for SSO authentication purpose.
If there is a failure in steps 1 through 15 -- the authentication procedure
stops.
#### 7.3.2.2 Message Flow with IdP (SSO Server) and OP co-hosting
The SSO subsystem under the solution can provide some forms of interworking
with, or support for, other SSO systems, notably OpenID and Liberty Alliance.
In the following a message flow of the authentication process is defined to
describe business cases where while an operator wishes to be OpenID provider.
It makes the operator a critical part of OpenID framework in this case, and
allows the operator to leverage their valuable assets, such as subscription
credentials and their customers\' trust, effectively enabling operators to
become OpenID providers.
Figure 7.3-6 Interworking of SDALS with the OpenID that co-hosts IdP (SSO
Server) and OP
The basic steps are as follows:
1) The UE issues an authentication request AuthnOpenID to the RP which
includes an OpenID identifier.
2) The OpenID Identifier is normalized as described in Appendix A.1 of
[14].The RP (Application server), using the presented OpenID identifier,
discovers the URL of the OpenID identity provider OP, and redirects the user
authentication request to that URL. The request includes the RP identifier
(RP_credential).
3) The authentication request is redirected to the OpenID identity provider
(OP). After this step the OP correlates the OpenID identifier with the UE
identifiers.
4) The OP authenticates the RP based on the RP identifier. Assuming RP
authentication success, the OP checks whether there is already a shared secret
_K_ 0 between the UE and the OP according to the OpenID identifier. If _K_ 0
exists, the process jumps to step 11; otherwise, the process goes on to the
next step.
NOTE 1: The RP and the OP shall have a shared secret (_K_ r, o) using existing
mechanism, for example, using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol or pre-
shared secret, the details of shared key establishment between the RP and OP
are out of scope. With this shared secret the OP can sign subsequent messages
and the RP can verify those messages.
NOTE 2: The OP is the sole decision point for RP\'s authenticity, and this
means that any explicit messaging, e.g. to the UE, regarding the OP\'s
decision on the authenticity of the RP, is redundant and unnecessary.
NOTE 3: There may be security concerns if this message (about OP notifying the
UE about failure of OP authentication of the RP) is sent unprotected.
5) The OP sends authentication request to the HSS, then it obtains the SIP
Digest authentication vector SD-AV and the user profile based on the
U_credential from the HSS. The SD-AV consists of the qop (quality of
protection) value, the authentication algorithm, realm, and a hash, called H
(A1), of the U_credential, realm, and password. Refer to RFC 2617 [5] for
additional information on the values in the authentication vector for SIP
Digest based authentication. In a multiple HSS environment, the OP may have to
obtain the address of the HSS where the UE is stored by querying the SLF.
6) The OP generates a random nonce, stores H(A1) and the nonce against the
U_credential.
7) The OP sends a 401 Auth_Challenge to the UE which includes the nonce, the
realm, qop, algorithm and U_credential.
8) Upon receiving the challenge, the UE generates a random cnonce and the
H(A1), and then generates the shared secret _K_ 0 based on the H(A1), the
cnonce, etc. It then uses the cnonce as well as parameters provided in the 401
Auth_Challenge such as nonce, U_credential and qop to calculate an
authentication response according to RFC 2617[5].
9) The UE sends a response to the OP which includes the cnonce, the nonce, the
response, the realm, the U_credential, qop, algorithm, nonce-count and Digest-
url.
10) Upon receiving the response, The OP uses the previously stored nonce to
check against the nonce included in the response. If the check is successful,
the OP calculates the expected response (Xresponse) using the previously
stored H(A1) and the nonce together with other parameters contained in the
response (e.g.cnonce, nonce-count, qop, as specified in RFC 2617[5]) and uses
this to check against the response sent by the UE. If the check is successful
the authentication of the UE is succeeded, else the authentication fails. The
OP stores an authentication assertion (UE_Assert). If the UE is successfully
authenticated, the OP generates the shared secret _K_ ~0~ based on the H(A1),
the cnonce, etc.
11) The OP generates a random nonce1 and generates a shared secret _K_ 1 based
on _K_ 0, nonce1. The OP encrypts the nonce1 using _K_ 0, i.e. E _K_
0(nonce1); and encrypts the _K_ 1 and UE_Assert using _K_ r,o, i.e. E _K_ r,o
(_K_ 1,UE_Assert).
12) The OP sends the UE an message including E _K_ 0(nonce1) and E _K_ r,o
(_K_ 1,UE_Assert) with redirection.
13) The UE decrypts the E _K_ 0(nonce1); and then obtains the nonce1; The UE
will generates the shared secret _K_ 1 based on _K_ 0, nonce1.
14) The message sent by the OP is redirected to the RP including E _K_ r,o
(_K_ 1,UE_Assert).
15) The RP decrypts the E _K_ r,o (_K_ 1,UE_Assert), and obtains UE_Assert and
_K_ 1.
16) After verifying the UE_Assert, the RP generates authorization information
for the UE, i.e. UE_Author and encrypts UE_Author using _K_ 1 E
_K1_(UE_Author).
17) The RP notifies the UE about the authorization information.
18) The UE decrypts the E _K1_(UE_Author) and then accesses to the requested
service.
NOTE 4: The last 3 steps 16, 17 and 18 are application specific, they are
optional steps and not required for SSO authentication purpose.
If there is a failure in steps 1 through 18 -- the authentication procedure
stops.
NOTE 5: In the message flow of the authentication process above, steps 1
through 3 and steps 12 through 15 comply with OpenID specification, step 4
authenticates RP, which is similar to the association establishment process in
OpenID specification, steps 5 through 11 belong to SIP Digest-based
authentication, steps 16 through 18 provide application security.
Editor\'s Note: The aspects of providing keys for general application security
between a terminal and application server, not only for interwoking with
OpenID, should be also taken into account in the solution.
NOTE 6: The interworking with the Liberty Alliance is similar to the
interworking with the OpenID.
#### 7.3.2.3 Message Flow with AS and OP co-hosting
The solution to utilize SIP Digest authentication for SSO can maximize
commonality with the already defined 3GPP approaches for interworking with
non-3GPP-defined SSO system as described in TR33.924 [9] and TR33.980 [8].In
the following a message flow is defined to allow the interworking with OpenID
and the specific message flow is depicted as shown in Figure 7.3-7.
Figure 7.3-7 Interworking of SDALS with OpenID that co-hosts AS and OP
The basic message flow is as follows:
To initiate OpenID Authentication, the Relying Party should present the end
user with a form that has a field for entering a User-Supplied Identifier. The
form field\'s \"name\" attribute should have the value \"openid_identifier\".
1) The browser in the ME sends a User-Supplied Identifier to the Relying Party
2) The User-Supplied Identifier is normalized as described in Appendix A.1 of
[14]. The RP retrieves the address of the OP and performs a discovery of the
OP Endpoint URL (based on the User-Supplied Identifier) that the end user
wishes to use for authentication.
3) The RP and the OP may then establish a shared secret (called association)
using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol. The purpose of this shared
secret is that the OP can sign subsequent messages and the RP can verify those
messages.
NOTE 1: The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol between the OP and the RP
lies outside of the 3GPP specifications, this association using Diffie Hellman
is an optional feature and not required for interworking purposes. If the OP
and RP do not both reside under the control of the same MNO, the usage of this
option seems strongly advisableã€‚
4) The RP redirects the ME\'s browser to the OP with an OpenID Authentication
Request as defined in chapter 9 in [14]. The RP inserts into the
openid.claimed_id and into the openid.identity fields the user supplied
identifier of step 1.
5) Following this redirection the ME sends a HTTPS GET request to the OP.
6) The OP/AS initiates the ME authentication and responds with a HTTPS
response code 401 \"Unauthorized\", which contains a WWW Authenticate header
carrying a challenge requesting the UE to use SIP Digest Authentication with
SSO_APS. The response message also includes the OP/AS credential
(OP/AS_credential).
NOTE 2: The OP/AS and the IdP shall have a shared secret (_K_ o,i) using
existing mechanism, for example, using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
Protocol or pre-shared secret, the details of shared key establishment between
the OP/AS and IdP are out of scope.
7) If no valid _K_ 0 is available, then the ME sends a second HTTP request to
the IdP with a UE Authentication Request carrying the UE credential
(U_credential) and OP/AS_credential.
8) The IdP obtains the OP/AS_credential; The IdP authenticates the RP based on
the OP/AS_credential; then generates and stores related authentication result
OP/AS_Auth. According to the U_credential, the IdP first checks whether there
is already a shared secret _K_ 0 between the UE and IdP. If _K_ 0 exists, the
process jumps to step 15; otherwise, the process goes on to the next step.
9) The IdP sends authentication request to the HSS, it then obtains the SIP
Digest authentication vector SD-AV and the user profile based on the
U_credential from the HSS. The SD-AV consists of the qop (quality of
protection) value, the authentication algorithm, realm, and a hash, called H
(A1), of the U_credential, realm, and password. Refer to RFC 2617[5] for
additional information on the values in the authentication vector for SIP
Digest based authentication. In a multiple HSS environment, the IdP may have
to obtain the address of the HSS where the UE is stored by querying the SLF.
10) The IdP generates a random nonce, stores H(A1) and the nonce against the
U_credential.
11) The IdP sends a 401 Auth_Challenge to the UE which includes the nonce, the
realm, qop, algorithm and U_credential.
12) Upon receiving the challenge, the UE generates a random cnonce and the
H(A1), and then generates the shared secret _K_ 0 based on the H(A1), the
cnonce, etc. It then uses the cnonce as well as parameters provided in the 401
Auth_Challenge such as nonce, U_credential and qop to calculate an
authentication response according to RFC 2617[5].
13) The UE sends a response to the IdP which includes the cnonce, the nonce,
the response, the realm, the U_credential, qop, algorithm, nonce-count and
digest-url.
14) Upon receiving the response, the IdP uses the previously stored nonce to
check against the nonce included in the response. If the check is successful,
the IdP calculates the expected response (Xresponse) using the previously
stored H (A1) and the nonce together with other parameters contained in the
response (e.g.cnonce, nonce-count, qop, as specified in RFC 2617[5]) and uses
this to check against the response sent by the UE. If the check is successful,
the authentication of the UE is succeeded, else the authentication fails. If
the UE is successfully authenticated, the IdP calculates the value of rspauth
based on SIP Digest as specified in RFC 2617 [5] and generates the shared
secret _K_ 0 based on the H(A1), the cnonce, etc.
15) The IdP knows the User authentication conclusion (UE_Auth); and then the
IdP generates a random nonce1 and generates a shared secret _K_ 1 based on _K_
0 and nonce1. The IdP encrypts the nonce1 and OP/AS_Auth using _K_ 0, i.e. E
_K_ 0(nonce1,OP/AS_Auth); and encrypts the _K_ 1 and UE_Auth using _K_ o,i,
i.e. E _K_ o,i (_K_ 1,UE_Auth).
16) The IdP sends the UE an message including E _K_ 0(nonce1,OP/AS_Auth), E
_K_ o,i (_K_ 1,UE_Auth) ,and the value of rspauth with redirection.
17) The UE decrypts the E _K_ 0(nonce1,OP/AS_Auth) and then obtains OP/AS_Auth
and nonce1. Based on the OP/AS_Auth the UE knows the legitimacy of the
requested OP/AS. If the authentication result indicates that the OP/AS is not
valid, the UE will stop visiting the OP/AS. The UE calculates the rspauth in
the same way as the IdP did in step 14, and uses it to check against the
rspauth sent by the IdP. If the check is successful, the authentication of the
Network is succeeded, else the authentication fails. If the Network is
successfully authenticated, and then the UE will generates the shared secret
_K_ 1 based on _K_ 0, nonce1.
18) The message sent by the IdP is redirected to the OP/AS including E _K_ o,i
(_K_ 1,UE_Auth).
19) The OP/AS decrypts the E _K_ o,i (_K_ 1,UE_Auth), and obtains UE_Auth and
_K_ 1\. The OP/AS establishes whether the end user is authorized to perform
OpenID Authentication and wishes to do so based on the authorization
information stored in the UE_Auth. In particular, the UE_Auth may contain
information about the type of information which is allowed to be shared with
the RP. The OP/AS authenticates the user of OpenID using SSOa reference point,
and generates an assertion based on the authorization information.
20) The OP/AS redirects the browser to the return OpenID address i.e. the
OP/AS redirects the ME\'s browser back to the RP with either an assertion that
authentication is approved or a message that authentication failed. The
response header contains a number of fields defining the authentication
assertion which may be protected by the shared secret between OP/AS and RP.
The protection is especially important if the OP/AS and the RP do not reside
both in the same MNO network.
21) The RP validates the assertion i.e. checks if the authentication was
approved. The authenticated identity of the user is provided in the response
message towards the RP. If a shared secret was established in step 3, then it
is now used to verify the message from the OP/AS. If the validation of the
assertion and the verification of the message are successful, then the user is
logged in to the service of the RP.
If there is a failure in steps 1 through 21 -- the authentication procedure
stops.
#### 7.3.2.4 Solution 2 (SDALS) -- Improvements with RP authentication for IdP
(SSO Server) and OP co-hosting case
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether this solution with RP authentication is in
scope of 3GPP\'s responsibility.
##### Achieving RP authentication at the OP {#achieving-rp-authentication-at-
the-op .H6}
The protocol depicted in Figure 7.3-6 does not show how RP authentication can
be achieved. Particularly, it is not clear whether and how RP uses any secret
in the steps 1-4 towards the OP. In order to achieve RP authentication,
additional steps need to be considered. If we assume that the OP and RP
already share a secret Kr,o this secret has to be used for RP authentication
with the OP. Not shown in the protocol figure 7.3-6 are the association
creation steps of the OpenID protocol.
Note that the inclusion of RP authentication in the OpenID protocol requires
changes to the OpenID protocol itself as well as to the implementations of the
OP and RP. Thus, any such change should be carefully weighed for benefits
versus the cost. Moreover, it is desired that any such RP authentication
method should NOT affect implementations on the UE.
In general RP authentication will consist in a challenge response step between
OP and RP, where the OP has to send a challenge with a proof of freshness to
the RP, e.g. via a nonce. The RP can then use the pre-established shared
secret Kr,o to sign this nonce and return the answer to the OP. The response
to the authentication challenge can be as a direct response to the OP
authentication challenge, or can be integrated in the redirect message, which
sends the UE to the OP. In either case it needs to be ensured that the OP can
have reliable evidence on the authentication of the RP before engaging in
actual UE authentication. This allows to stop the protocol in the case of a
failed RP authentication, and saves communication effort between UE and OP in
the case of such a failed RP authentication. The OP can then directly convey
the information on the failed RP authentication to the UE.
##### Using Associations for RP authentication {#using-associations-for-rp-
authentication .H6}
If the RP establishes an association with the OP, the OpenID association
protocol can be slightly modified to incorporate a challenge from the OP to be
conveyed to the RP for the purpose of RP authentication.
During the association establishment the OP and RP can set up a message
authentication code (MAC) key which is later used to sign the assertion
message. This key is sent encrypted using a temporary secret key which is
negotiated between OP and RP using Diffie-Hellman (DH). In addition to that
key, deviating from the OpenID specs, the OP can include a nonce, also
encrypted with the DH-key, in the response to the RP.
The RP can then decrypt the nonce and the MAC key based on the negotiated DH-
key. The RP then uses its own pre-established Kr,o key to sign (or encrypt)
the nonce as received from the OP and adds it as an additional parameter to
the redirect message which is sent to the UE. Since the UE follows the
redirect to the OP, the OP receives the signed (or encrypted) nonce, and can
use the shared key Kr,o to authenticate the RP. In the case of a failed
authentication, the OP can send an alert message to the UE to protect it from
unauthenticated RPs. In the case of a successful RP authentication, the OP can
proceed with the protocol.
##### Simplified Variant Protocol with RP authentication and HTTPS protection
{#simplified-variant-protocol-with-rp-authentication-and-https-protection .H6}
Figure 7.3-8 depicts a revised protocol where the RP is authenticated by the
OP using a modified OpenID association messaging
Figure 7.3-8 Interworking of SDALS with IdP (SSO Server) and OP co-hosting,
with RP authentication
The steps of this variant protocol are as follows:
1) The UE issues an authentication request AuthnOpenID to the RP which
includes an OpenID identifier.
2) The RP sends an (OpenID) association request to the OP. The RP and the OP
then establish a Diffie-Hellman Key D-H, according to Section 8 of [14]. OP
generates an association secret and association handle (together called
association according to [14]).
3) The OP sends RP an association response according to [14], Section 8.2,
including association secret and nonce0, both encrypted with the D-H key
established in step 2 _._
4) The RP decrypts the received encrypted nonce0 and encrypted association
secret, and signs nonce0 with _Kr,o._
NOTE 1: HMAC or another suitable symmetrical signature algorithm may be used
to sign nonce0
NOTE 2: The RP and the OP shall have a shared secret (_K_ r, o) using existing
mechanism, for example, using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol or pre-
shared secret, the details of shared key establishment between the RP and OP
are out of scope. With this shared secret the OP can sign subsequent messages
and the RP can verify those messages.
5) The RP redirects the authentication request sent by the UE which includes
the OpenID identifier, the RP identifier (RP_credential), and the signed
nonce0.
6) The authentication request is redirected to the OP. The redirection
includes OpenID identifier and RP_credential.
7) (Optionally) The OP may set up TLS and initiates HTTPS communiation with
UE. This could be done by configuration of the OP web server.
8) The OP verifies the signature of nonce0 to authenticate the RP.
9) If RP authentication of step 9 failed, the OP sends an alert message 10b,
(optionally protected by HTTPS if step 7 is taken), to indicate RP
authentication failure, to the UE. If RP authentication in step 9 succeeded,
proceed to step 11.
10) The OP determines if a valid key _K~0~_ exists. If the answer is no,
proceed to step 11. If yes, proceed to step 17.
11) The OP sends authentication request to the HSS, then it obtains the SIP
Digest authentication vector SD-AV and the user profile based on the
U_credential from the HSS. The SD-AV consists of the qop (quality of
protection) value, the authentication algorithm, realm, and a hash, called H
(A1), of the U_credential, realm, and password. Refer to RFC 2617 [5] for
additional information on the values in the authentication vector for SIP
Digest based authentication. In a multiple HSS environment, the OP may have to
obtain the address of the HSS where the UE is stored by querying the SLF.
12) The OP generates a random nonce, stores H(A1) and the nonce against the
U_credential.
13) The OP sends, optionally protected by HTTPS, a 401 Auth_Challenge (as a
SIP-Digest Auth challenge) to the UE which includes the nonce, the realm, qop,
algorithm and U_credential.
14) Upon receiving the challenge, the UE generates a random cnonce and the
H(A1), and then generates the shared secret _K_ 0 based on the H(A1), the
cnonce, etc. It then uses the cnonce as well as parameters provided in the 401
Auth_Challenge such as nonce, U_credential and qop to calculate an
authentication response according to RFC 2617[5].
15) The UE sends a challenge response, optionally protected by HTTPS, to the
OP which includes the cnonce, the nonce, the response, the realm, the
U_credential, qop, algorithm, nonce-count and Digest-url.
16) Upon receiving the response, The OP uses the previously stored nonce to
check against the nonce included in the response. If the check is successful,
the OP calculates the expected response (Xresponse) using the previously
stored H(A1) and the nonce together with other parameters contained in the
response (e.g.cnonce, nonce-count, qop, as specified in RFC 2617[5]) and uses
this to check against the response sent by the UE. If the check is successful
the authentication of the UE is succeeded, else the authentication fails. If
the UE is successfully authenticated, the OP generates the shared secret _K_ 0
based on the H(A1), the cnonce, etc.
17) The OP creates an authentication assertion (UE_Assert) signed using the
association secret (from step 3 above).
18) The OP generates a random nonce1 and generates a shared secret _K_ 1 based
on _K_ 0, nonce1. The OP encrypts the nonce1 using _K_ 0, i.e. E _K_
0(nonce1); and encrypts the _K_ 1 and the signed UE_Assert using _K_ r,o, i.e.
E _K_ r,o (_K_ 1, signed(UE_Assert)).
19) The OP sends the UE an message including E _K_ 0(nonce1) and E _K_ r,o
(_K_ 1, signed(UE_Assert)) with redirection to RP.
20) The UE decrypts the E _K_ 0(nonce1); and then obtains the nonce1; The UE
will generates the shared secret _K_ 1 based on _K_ 0, nonce1.
21) The message sent by the OP is redirected to the RP including E _K_ r,o
(_K_ 1,signed UE_Assert).
22) The RP decrypts the E _K_ r,o (_K_ 1, signed UE_Assert), and obtains
UE_Assert and _K_ 1\. RP verifies signature of UE_Assert using the association
secret shared with OP.
23) After verifying the UE_Assert, the RP generates an authorization
information for the UE, i.e. UE_Author and encrypt UE_Author using _K_ 1 E
_K1_(UE_Author).
24) The RP notifies the UE about the authorization information, which is
contained in this message, encrypted with K~1~.
25) The UE decrypts the E _K1_(UE_Author) and then accesses to the requested
service.
### 7.3.3 Solution 2 SDLAS - evaluation
In the variant described in 7.3.2.1 the OpenID Identity Provider server
(figure 7.3-6) has to support the following 3GPP specific functionalities:
\- Establishment of a shared secret between RP and OP
\- Validation of K0
\- Interface to HSS to obtain the SD-AV, user profile and related attributes
\- Handling of User credentials in addition to OpenID identifier
\- Storage and handling of data related to U_credential (nonce, H(A1))
\- Extensive generation and handling of nonces (nonce, nonce1, cnonce)
compared to OpenID which only uses one nonce to prevent replay attacks against
the RP
In addition the RP needs to support non-OpenID specific extensions with regard
to the incoming redirection (step 14, figure 7.3-6), where the assertion and a
key are together encrypted _._
If solution 2 is used in conjunction with Liberty Alliance as outlined in
7.3.2.1 in the text above figure 7.3-7, then also 3GPP specific extensions to
the IdP and the service provider similar to the one above for OpenID are
needed (figure 7.3-7 where the IdP is a Liberty Alliance compliant IdP). The
variant of solution 2 in 7.3.2.3 improves the RP security by adding
authentication and usage of associations. This improvement is 3GPP specific
and not part of OpenID and requires additional functionality from the RP and
OP.
For all variants of solution 2 the OpenID is collocated with the IdP and
Liberty Alliance identity management specifications and their extensions are
not part of the 3GPP specification family. All variants of solution 2
introduce some extensions to the non-3GPP specific protocols and either they
create a 3GPP specific extension which non 3GPP nodes and services have to
follow or they create a dependency to an external standardization body with a
different release schedule.
## 7.4 The Use of protocol binding for SIP Digest over TLS to prevent MitM
attacks
The solution described in this section assumes the same architectural
framework given in figure 7.2-1. The new solution improves upon the solution
depicted in Figure 7.2-1 in two aspects:
1) The solution uses TLS as an underlying security protocol for SIP Digest,
providing basic protection against simple MitM attacker.
2) The solution further uses binding between the TLS tunnel and the SIP digest
protocol, thereby providing protection against man-in-the-middle (MitM)
attackers by preventing such an attacker from running a TLS session with the
BSF and interacting with the UE via HTTP outside of the TLS tunnel.
The new solution, which is a non-UICC based (SIP Digest) protocol on top of a
TLS tunnel, employs a generic form of GBA based on the solution provided in TS
33.220 [2]. The binding solution makes explicit use of the shared SIP Digest
credentials between the network and the UE. As a result of the binding between
the TLS and SIP-Digest, this solution prevents a MitM attacker from taking
advantage of the dual authentication aspects of the protocol. The following
Figure 7.4-1 and the step-wise description below the figure explain the
protocol flow of the new solution.
Figure 7.4-1 procedure of non-UICC based GBA solution, using TLS and binding
to SIP-Digest
The proposed binding solution is illustrated in Fig. 7.4-1 above and described
as follows:
1) The UE starts the bootstrapping procedure by initiating a TLS session with
the BSF. The UE and BSF. The UE authenticates the BSF by the certificate
presented by the BSF. The BSF does not require authentication from the UE at
this point.
2) Following the establishment of the TLS tunnel the UE sends an HTTP Request
message (which includes the IMPI) to the BSF.
3) The BSF requests an authentication vector (AV) from the HSS.
4) The HSS sends the AV to the BSF.
5) The BSF sends the UE an authentication challenge in a HTTP 401 Unauthorized
response. This challenge includes a www-authenticate header and a randomly
generated nonce.
6) The UE calculates a cnonce and generates an HTTP request message which is
calculated according RFC 2617. While calculating this response, the UE also
generates a SIP-Digest response session key, denoted Ksip-digest, from the SIP
Digest credential, H(A1), and cnonce. The UE then generates a message
authentication code (MAC) value Bres using both the TLS tunnel session key and
Ksip-digest as inputs for the MAC algorithm. This binds the TLS tunnel
authentication with the SIP-Digest authentication within GBA.
Editor\'s note: Definition and derivation of Ksip-digest is needed.
7) Both the SIP-Digest authentication challenge response and Bres are sent
back to the BSF as part of the Authorization header in a GET request message.
The Get request message is integrity protected using the key Ksip-digest.
Editor\'s Note: The solution proposes to use the same Digest Response as used
in IMS registration. A solution for protocol separation is ffs.
NOTE 1: Bres may be calculated by the same algorithm as the authentication
response, however with different input parameters.
8) The BSF receives the GET request which contains the authentication
challenge response and checks that the expected response, i.e., the integrity
value which is to be calculated by the BSF, matches the integrity value of the
received challenge response. The BSF calculates Ksip-digest from the SIP-
Digest credential H(A1) it already has from the AV and the cnonce received
from the GET request. The BSF then checks Bres against its own, computed
expected value (called XBres). It can do so because it now knows both keys
(Ksip-digest and the TLS tunnel session key) used in the calculation of Bres.
If the received Bres matches XBres, and the received authentication challenge
response integrity value matches its expected integrity value the BSF
determines that the UE has been authenticated and also assures itself that,
because of the binding effect verified from the matching of the Bres and
XBres, the entity (UE) that was authenticated in the formation of the tunnel
is the same entity it (the BSF) just authenticated in the GBA aspect of the
protocol. If these checks are successful, the user is considered authenticated
and the user\'s private user identity is registered to the BSF.
Editor\'s note: The consistency of this step with the lack of authentication
step in Step 1 needs to be explained.
Editor\'s note: The channel binding requires a new RFC.
Editor\'s note: Channel binding for the UE to verify the BSF is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Protocol separation from ordinary IMS usage is FFS.
9) The BSF indicates to the UE the successful authentication of the user by
sending the UE a 200 OK response which includes B-TID, Ks_lifetime, and
rspauth (generated according to RFC 2617).
###### ### Annex A: Use of the key derivation function
# A.1 Derivation of passwd and Ks
Derivation of passwd and Ks for GBA_Digest follows the same procedure as NAF
specific key derivation in GBA and GBA_U (TS 33.220 [2] Annex B.3).
The input parameters for the key derivation function to derive passwd and Ks
shall be the following:
\- FC = 0x01,
\- P1 = TLS_MK_Extr,
\- L1 = length of TLS_MK_Extr is 48 octets (i.e. 0x00 0x30),
In the derivation of passwd as specified in Clause 7.2.2, Step 5,
\- P0 = \"GBA_Digest_RESP\"\ (i.e. 0x47 0x42 0x41 0x5F 0x44 0x69 0x67 0x65
0x73 0x74 0x5F 0x52 0x45 0x53 0x50), and
\- L0 = length of P0 is 15 octets (i.e., 0x00 0x0F).
In the key derivation of Ks as specified in Clause 7.2.2, Step 6,
\- P0 = \"GBA_Digest_Ks\"\ (i.e. 0x47 0x42 0x41 0x5F 0x44 0x69 0x67 0x65 0x73
0x74 0x5F 0x4B 0x73),
\- L0 = length of P0 is 13 octets (i.e., 0x00 0x0D),
\- P2 = RESP, and
\- L2 = length of RESP is variable and depends on the algorithm used in HTTP
Digest (e.g., 32 if MD5 is used)
The Key to be used in the key derivation function shall be:
\- H(A1) as specified in Clause 7.2.2, step 5
NOTE: In the specification this function is denoted as:\ passwd = KDF (H(A1),
\"GBA_Digest_RESP\", TLS_MK_Extr), and\ Ks = KDF (H(A1), \" GBA_Digest_Ks\",
TLS_MK_Extr, RESP).
# A.2 NAF specific key derivation in GBA_Digest
In GBA_Digest, the input parameters for the key derivation function to derive
Ks_NAF shall be the following:
\- FC = 0x01,
\- P0 = \"gba-digest\" (i.e. 0x67 0x62 0x61 0x2d 0x64 0x69 0x67 0x65 0x73
0x74), and
\- L0 = length of P0 is 10 octets (i.e., 0x00 0x0a).
\- P1 = nonce,
\- L1 = length of nonce is variable (not greater than 65535),
\- P2 = IMPI encoded to an octet string using UTF-8 encoding (see clause B.2.1
of TS 33.220 [2]),
\- L2 = length of IMPI is variable (not greater than 65535),
\- P3 = NAF_ID with the FQDN part of the NAF_ID encoded to an octet string
using UTF-8 encoding (see clause B.2.1 of TS 33.220 [2]), and
\- L3 = length of NAF_ID is variable (not greater that 65535).
The Key to be used in key derivation shall be:
\- Ks as specified in clause A.1 of the present document,
NOTE: In clause 7.2.2 this function is denoted as:
> Ks_NAF = KDF (Ks, \"gba-digest\", nonce, IMPI, NAF_Id).
