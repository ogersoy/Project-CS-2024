# 4 Overview of Security Architecture
The MTC security architecture described in figure 4-1 is based on the system
architecture given in TS 23.682 [23] and is given here for helping to analyse
the threats in the following clause.
Figure 4-1: Potential high level security architecture for MTC Architecture
for 3GPP Architecture for Machine-Type Communication
The following defines one potential high level security architecture for MTC
Non-Roaming Architecture. Three different areas are defined. When analysing
the security aspects of the key issues it should be considered to which
area(s) the key issues is impacting. It should also be noted that the analysed
key issues could be related to more than one area, e.g. A and B.
> Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether single architecture can meet the
> requirements of all key issues.
>
> Editor\'s Note: The security architecture needs further refinement.
A) Security for MTC communication between the UE and 3GPP network can be
further divided to:
A1) Security for MTC communication between the UE and RAN.
A2) Security for MTC communication between the UE and NAS.
A3) Security for MTC communication between the UE and MTC-IWF.
B) Security for MTC communication between the 3GPP network and an entity
outside the 3GPP network can be further divided to:
B1) Security for MTC communication between the MTC server and 3GPP network in
indirect deployment model. This can be further divided into security aspects
when the MTC server is within the 3GPP network and when it is outside the 3GPP
network.
B2) Security for MTC communication between the MTC application and 3GPP
network in direct deployment model.
Editor\'s Note: B2 is currently FFS.
The communication between MTC server and MTC application is out of 3GPP scope.
C) Security for MTC communication between the an entity outside the 3GPP
network and the UE can be further divided to:.
C1) Security for MTC communication between the MTC server and the UE in
indirect deployment model.
C2) Security for MTC communication between the MTC application and the UE in
direct deployment model.
Editor\'s Note: C2 is currently FFS.

# 5 Description of envisioned security aspects of Machine-Type and other
Mobile Data Applications Communications Enhancements
## 5.1 Device Triggering Enhancements
### 5.1.1 Issue Details
Device triggering issues are defined in TR 23.888 [10], clause 5.8. Several
use cases should be considered in the present document as follows:
\- A UE receives a trigger indication when it is in detached state.
\- A UE receives a trigger indication when it is in attached state and the UE
has no PDP context/PDN connection.
\- A UE receives a trigger indication when it is in attached state and the UE
has a PDP context/PDN connection.
Note: The security of Device triggering is covered in key issue-Device
triggering and key issue-external interface security. In Device triggering key
issue, only the security of trigger indication transferred from PLMN to the UE
is considered. The security of trigger indication transferred from MTC server
to the PLMN is considered in the key issue-external interface security.
### 5.1.2 Threats
False network attack: When a UE is in detached state, the attacker can
impersonate a network to send a trigger indication to the UE.
Although there are existing mechanisms in the current network to prevent a UE
to connect to a false network, there is still an issue. UE used only for MTC
are different from normal UEs such that they may need to operate for a long
time by using a single battery supply without recharging. False network
triggering can awaken a UE and waste its power. So the false network attack is
more serious for UE used only for MTC compared to non-MTC communications and
therefore the network needs improvement to deal with this security threat.
By means of sending fake triggering messages, an attacker can also obtain
information on whether a particular UE is at that particular location at that
point in time. If the UE can be linked to an individual, this may have privacy
implications.
Tamper attack: The trigger indication may contain the IP@ (or FQDN) and/or TCP
(or UDP) port of the application server that the UE has to contact. If the IP@
(or FQDN) and/or TCP (or UDP) port of the application server is tampered by
the attacker, the UE may establish the PDN connection to the wrong MTC server
or be rejected by the MTC server. It will cause that UE is unable to
communicate with the correct MTC server and it will also waste the UE\'s power
consumption.
When the SMS is used to trigger UEs, SMS spam could be exploited by the
attackers to send fake trigger indication. Fake / fraudulent SMS trigger could
be sent by malicious SME or by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) on Tsms. Although
the human holding a normal UE can make his own judgment, the fake trigger
indication sent in SMS spam could be a serious attack on the unattended UEs
and will lead to battery draining (particularly for the devices with limited
power supply) and improper action. Moreover the fake trigger indication sent
in SMS will cause UEs trying to access the network and lead to the waste of
network resources. In addition, malicious SMS flooding / spamming will
adversely impact resources of HLR, network and UE. Replay of SMS trigger may
also happen. It is possible that MitM happens on Tsms interface that can lead
to several different attacks, some of which are mentioned above.
User Plane based triggering would be more prone to tampering and fake
triggering attacks if application layer integrity solution is not employed, as
there is no integrity and replay protection provided to the user plane traffic
on the (radio) access link by the core network.
Tracking UEs: The 3GPP network has to keep track of the location of the UE in
order to sent the Device trigger to it. Some types of UE can be linked to an
individual. Contrary to normal UE, UE used only for MTC are often not under
the control of the particular individual (i.e. cannot turn it off). As such,
the individual has no control over their privacy with respect to location
information tracking by the network.
### 5.1.3 Security Requirements
#### 5.1.3.0 General
It may not be possible to totally prevent an UE from receiving a trigger
indication from a fake network. Therefore it should be studied further whether
the device trigger could be protected so that the impact of fake device
triggers to the battery lifetime and unauthorized tracking of the UE would be
minimized.
The system should provide a mechanism such that only trigger indications
received from authorized network entities(e.g. MTC Server, MTC Application,
entities acting as a SME) will lead to triggering of UEs.
Upon receiving a trigger indication from a source that is not an authorized
network entity, the network should be able to provide the details of the
source (e.g. address) to the MTC User.
The system should provide a mechanism to the MTC User to provide a set of
authorized network entities.
It has to be ensured that an UE responds only to genuine trigger messages.
The system should ensure that only authentic triggers will be conveyed to the
UEs. For 3G/LTE system, trigger indication should be integrity protected.
The system should also provide a mechanism that doesn\'t require continues
tracking of location information of the UE by the network. This prevents
privacy implications for those UEs that can be linked to an individual and are
not under the direct control of the particular individual.
#### 5.1.3.1 SMS based triggering
There should be protection against malicious SMS flooding and spamming; all
these check should be performed in the network.
When the trigger indication is sent in SMS via T~sms~, the SMS-SC/IP-SM-GW may
verify the source of the triggering SMS targeting on unattended UEs to ensure
the SMS is from an authenticated and authorized source.
When the trigger indication is received via T~sp~ and sent as MT-SMS to SMS-
SC/IP-SM-GW and T4, MTC-IWF should verify the source of trigger request
(authenticated and authorized), ensure the integrity of the received trigger
request, and ensure that the message has not been replayed, if it\'s sent from
outside the 3GPP network. When SMS-SC/IP-SM-GW receives MT-SMS from MTC-IWF
over T4 interface, it knows the short message is for MTC purpose and can be
trusted.
When the trigger indication is sent in SMS to SMS-SC/IP-SM-GW via SMS-IWMSC,
SMS-SC/ IP-SM-GW is required to distinguish and block MO MTC device trigger
messages from normal UEs.
SMS-SC is required to distinguish ordinary short messages from short messages
for triggering unattended UEs and act accordingly (e.g. selectively block).
For SMS based device trigger, the MTC device trigger message contains TP-PID
and Application Port ID. TP-PID is used as the device trigger indication to
distinguish trigger message from normal short message, and the SMS Application
Port Id is used to identify the application to receive the trigger.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how the SMS-SC/IP-SM-GW can distinguish ordinary
short messages from short messages for triggering unattended UEs received over
MTCsms interface.
Editor\'s Note: other suitable network elements for source authorization
checking are FFS.
Editor\'s Note: The system should provide a mechanism to ensure that only
intended trigger indications will be conveyed to the UEs.
#### 5.1.3.2 NAS Signalling based triggering
When the trigger indication is sent in NAS signalling to SGSN/MME via MTC~sp~
and T5a/T5b, MTC-IWF should verify the source of trigger request and ensure
the integrity of the received trigger request, if it\'s sent from outside the
3GPP network.
#### 5.1.3.3 User Plane based triggering
The UP based triggering message should be integrity and replay protected. The
UP based triggering message may be confidentiality protected.
### 5.1.4 Solutions
#### 5.1.4.0 General
The 3GPP network should keep a list of MTC servers authorized to send trigger
to a given UE and the type of trigger the MTC server is authorized to send.
The list should contain identity of the UE, MTC server identity and the
related allowed triggering. This way, for each trigger, the 3GPP network can
verify if the MTC server is allowed to send trigger and whether the trigger is
authorized. Clause 5.1.3 describes how authorization is performed at different
interfaces.
Editor\'s Note: Mapping of the device to the device classes is FFS.
#### 5.1.4.1 For offline Device Triggering:
##### 5.1.4.1.0 General
**Solution 1:** If the UE is in detached state, the UE should be able to
validate the network identity when it receives a trigger indication:
The UE should store a temporary identifier of the network it has last
attached. The identifier is known to the network side. The network sends the
identifier it knows as part of the trigger indication to the UE. When the UE
receives a trigger indication, it should compare the network identity from the
received indication and the identity it has stored.
If the two network identities match, the UE accepts the trigger indication.
Otherwise, the trigger indication is abandoned. When the UE has been
successfully triggered, the temporary identifier should be discarded and
replaced by a new temporary network identifier which is also known to the
network.
Editor\'s Note: How to securely bind the temporary identity to the trigger
message is FFS.
Editor\'s Note: There is no valid temporary identifier in the initial state,
i.e. when the UE first time attach to the network, this situation needs to be
considered.
**Solution 2:** If the UE is in detached state, the network should protect the
trigger indication message by using the last security context stored in the
network and the UE.
The UE should store the last security context shared with the attached
network. The trigger indication should be protected, at least for integrity
(and may be for confidentiality too), by the last shared security context.
Only a network that has a valid stored shared security context could generate
a valid trigger indication message, and only the UE which has stored a valid
security context would be able to validate (i.e. verify integrity and/or
decrypt) the trigger indication from the trigger indication message protected
by the same security context. If validation of the trigger indication is
successful, the network is considered valid by the UE, and would accept the
indication. Otherwise, the network is considered invalid, and the trigger
indication is abandoned. After the UE has been successfully triggered, a new
security context is established and stored at both the UE and the network, to
be used to protect (on the network side) and validate (on the device side) a
new trigger indication the next time.
Editor\'s Note: There may be multiple solutions. It is FFS if a new security
context is needed.
##### 5.1.4.1.1 Impacts on existing nodes or functionality
For solution 1, a UE should store the last attached network identity. When it
receives a triggering indication, it should compare the network identity from
the present indication and the stored identity.
For solution 2, a UE and network entities should store the last security
context used when the UE was attached in the network.
#### 5.1.4.2 For online Device Triggering
##### 5.1.4.2.1 General description
For the concluded solutions (solutions in TR 23.888 V1.6.0 [10] clause 7.2.2
and solutions in TS 23.682 V0.1.0 [23], annex A), the current UMTS and LTE
access security mechanisms (after the security mechanism is activated) can be
used to protect the trigger indication on the radio access interface. The
current mechanisms do not ensure that the trigger came from an authorized
source.
But in GSM/GPRS network or for user plane based trigger, the trigger
indication can only be confidentiality protected using the current security
mechanism on the radio access interface.
For UP based triggering, the trigger can only be confidentiality protected
using the current access security mechanism on the radio access interface.
In GSM/GPRS network, the trigger can only be confidentiality protected using
the current security mechanism on the radio access interface.
In case of GSM/GPRS network or UMTS network using SIM authentication, there is
no protection against false triggering on the radio access network.
Editor\'s Note: For any new SA2 solution on device triggering, SA3 need to do
security analysis.
##### 5.1.4.2.2 Solution 1: Triggering via NAS signalling
A Device triggering mechanisms currently being considered in SA2 TR 23.887
[26] is triggering via T5 and using NAS signalling (e.g. a new information
element in an existing NAS message or a new NAS message). One possibility
under discussion in SA2 is that the device trigger may possibly also be sent
from the network to the UE using SMS format but NAS as a transport. In this
case, current NAS security mechanisms can be used to provide the security for
the NAS layer. After NAS SMC, NAS security is activated. All NAS signaling
messages should be integrity-protected according to TS 33.401 [13], and
therefore current LTE security mechanisms ensure that the trigger indication
is not tampered with. In this case the SMS trigger will also benefit from the
integrity protection of NAS signalling in LTE.
Source verification needs to be considered which in this context is understood
to mean that the UE can verify that the source of the trigger is a valid MTC
server. This could be achieved in the following ways:
**Option A**
UE trusts the 3GPP network sending the NAS integrity protected trigger. In
this case the UE could be configured with identities of trusted visited 3GPP
networks. (Somewhat analogically as trusted non3GPP access networks can be
configured in the UE in TS 33.402 [15].) In this context trusted visited 3GPP
network would mean networks which are trusted to have a secure path from the
visited 3GPP network to the home 3GPP network to convey the device trigger. In
addition the UE could be configured with information if there exists a secured
Tsp interface from the MTC server to the 3GPP home network, so that it can be
ensured that only trigger indications received from authorized MTC Servers
will lead to triggering of UEs \"belonging\" to that MTC server.
When the UE then receives a NAS integrity protected trigger, it can, after
verifying NAS integrity protection, verify whether the condition regarding the
visited and home 3GPP network described above are met. If they are met, the
trigger can be accepted.
MME should not send the trigger in a NAS message without integrity protection.
If there is no NAS integrity protection of the trigger or if the 3GPP network
is not trusted, the UE could discard the trigger and send a Reject message to
MME and MTC-IWF with a proper cause or alternatively look deeper into the
trigger if end-to-end protection was applied.
When MME receives a reject response from UE with a cause indicating no
integrity protection or integrity check failure, MME can:
\- Initiate 3GPP AKA procedure towards UE so that when there is security
context shared between them MME can forward the trigger;
\- Or forward the reject message to MTC-IWF, so that MTC-IWF can choose
another route to send the trigger.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how the network elements can distinguish ordinary
short messages from short messages for triggering unattended UEs
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS if both of the following cases or only one of them
are possible, i.e. that the device trusts the home network always to have the
external interface in place or whether the device cannot always trust the home
network to have the external interface in place.
Editor\'s Note: The above solution is intended for LTE, it is FFS how to
protect trigger indication in GSM/UMTS.
Editor\'s note: The benefits of the proposed solution should be weighed
against the cost of increased battery consumption.
An alternative approach is that the MTC server could trigger the UE through a
GBA-push process via NAS signalling.
**Option B**
UE could verify whether the trigger is coming from an authorized MTC IWF.
When the UE receives the message from MTC-IWF, it should perform integrity
check first to verify whether the message is sent from an authorized MTC-IWF.
When the integrity check is completed successfully, the UE will decrypt the
message and respond to it accordingly. The verification is done by performing
integrity check of the received trigger message with the integrity key that
the UE and the MTC-IWF share, as described in Solution 6.
##### 5.1.4.2.3 Solution 2: Solution for fake SMS triggering from normal UE in
the same network as UE used only for MTC
The fake triggering SMS can be blocked on the network side. As instructed in
the following figure, the SMS-SC can receive short message from MTC Server via
Tsms interface (as shown by the green line) or T4 interface (as shown by the
blue line) or from SMS-IWMSC (as shown by the red line).
This solution is to block any SMS to UE that comes from SMS-GMSC.
Figure 5.1.4.2.3-1: Triggering short message delivery
When SMS-SC receives short message from MTC Server via Tsms, the current
external interface security can check whether the MTC Server is authorized to
send the trigger to the UE. If it is, the SMS-SC continues to send the short
message. When SMS-SC receives short message which is forwarded by MTC-IWF via
T4 interface, the SMS-SC considered T4 interface is trusted and continues to
send the short message. Because the MTC-IWF can authenticate with MTC server
and ensure that only the authorized MTC Server triggers the UE according
functionality of MTC-IWF defined in TR 23.888 [10] and external interface
security solution defined in the current document. When the SMS-SC receives
short message from SMS-IWMSC, it forwards the short message to SMS-GMSC
following normal SMS procedure but with a check indication. Then SMS-GMSC
forwards the target UE\'s identifier in the short message to HLR/HSS and
obtains serving MSC/SGSN routing information for the target UE from HLR/HSS.
After HLR/HSS receives the target UE\'s identifier, it inquires the
corresponding subscription data and checks whether the target UE is UE used
for MTC based on the target UE\'s identifier and inquiry result. If the target
UE is used for MTC, HLR/HSS sends inquiry result or reject indication to the
SMS-GMSC/IP-SM-GW and SMS procedure terminates. If the target UE is not used
for MTC, HLR/HSS sends inquiry result or confirm indication to the SMS-
GMSC/IP-SM-GW and SMS procedure continues.
Editor\'s Note 1: To get clarification from SA2, whether it is possible for
the HSS to distinguish the target device is a normal UE or UE used only for
MTC.
Editor\'s Note 2: It is FFS, whether this solution can be combined with home
network routing as defined in TR 23.840 [39] so that SMSs from external
networks towards UEs used only for MTC can also be blocked.
##### 5.1.4.2.4 Solution 3: Solutions protecting SMS triggering
**A. Network based SMS payload filtering**
Protection against SMS spoofing can be provided if the HPLMN implements home
network routing for SMS (TR 23.840 [39]) and implements filters in the home
network SMS infrastructure to ensure that MTC trigger SMSs can only be sent
from an authorized whitelist of senders. This approach requires that the SMS
infrastructure can filter based on payload contents for all SMS from untrusted
sources.
Data of routing information, serving node information can be pushed from
HSS/HLR and saved locally in SMSC/SMS-GMSC.
Editor\'s Note: it\'s FFS how the HSS can push the info to the SMSC when there
are changes of subscription.
**B. UE based SMSC whitelisting**
In the absence of SMS home routing, an UE could be configured to only accept
MTC triggers from whitelisted HPLMN SMSCs. Assuming SMS filtering at these
whitelisted HPLMN SMSCs then this could protect against the most basic form of
SMS spoofing. Challenges with this solution are how to provision and maintain
the SMSC whitelist on the UE and the SMS filtering at the whitelisted HPLMN
SMSCs.
**C. Source authentication**
Even home network routed SMS combined with SMS payload filtering is vulnerable
to attacks where network internal nodes or network signalling links are
compromised. If such attacks need to be mitigated, or if home network routing
is not provided, then some form of cryptographic protection of MTC triggers is
needed between the MTC server and the UE. Three possible approaches are listed
below:
NOTE: The assumption \"if home network routing is not provided\" does not hold
when trigger source is outside network, because the trigger source does not
and should not have knowledge whether network will perform payload filtering.
  * **(U)SIM application toolkit security:** In this approach the trigger message is protected at the MTC server and sent directly to a (U)SIM application toolkit on the (U)SIM according to TS 23.048 [38]. If the message is authenticated by the (U)SIM (based on a pre-shared symmetric key), then the (U)SIM can forward the message to the UE for processing. With this method, UEs would need to be pre-provisioned to only act on triggering messages that have been verified by the (U)SIM application toolkit security mechanism.
Editor\'s Note: It is for further study whether USIM application toolkit
security can be used when the MTC server is outside the operator\'s domain.
  * **GBA push (either GBA_ME or GBA_U based):** In this approach GBA_Push, as specified in TS 33.223 [22], is used to secure the trigger message between the MTC server and the UE. Compared to the (U)SIM application toolkit approach, a new pre-shared symmetric key is not needed -- instead the UE can establish the GBA_Push keys by leveraging the existing AKA credentials that are used for network access security. With this method, UEs would need to be pre-provisioned to only act on triggering messages that have been verified using GBA push.
  * **Application based End to End protection:** As mentioned in the TS 23.682 [23], when using Tsms based SMS triggering, the trigger to the UE is encapsulated in a MT SMS as over-the-top application by the SME. So when the trigger indication is sent over Tsms, the network entity acting as SME should apply end-to-end integrity and replay protection and the MTC application on the UE should verify the source of the trigger and ensure the integrity of the received trigger request. A possible mechanism for application layer key establishment between the UE and the MTC application may be using the GBA push mechanism. The mechanism to verify the integrity of the trigger message by the MTC application is out of scope of this specification.

##### 5.1.4.2.6 Solution 5: Using GBA Push to secure Device triggering
procedure over Tsp and T4
End to end protection of the device trigger is regarded to be provided at the
application layer and therefore be out of scope for 3GPP specifications.
However, GBA push as defined in TS 33.223 [22] and e.g. Generic Push Layer as
defined in TS 33.224 [25] can be used to protect the device trigger.

Security for Device triggering procedure over Tsp
The following steps may be performed before step 2 in the Device triggering
procedure over Tsp in clause 5.2.1.
Precondition: To be able to use GBA push -based services the SCS needs to be
provided with the following information regarding the UE as is defined in
Annex B of TS 33.223 [22]. The mechanism how the information is provided is
out of the scope of the present document.
\- _UE_id_ : This is the External Identifier specified in TS 23.682 [23] or
MSISDN.
NOTE 1: According to TS 23.682 [23] the use of IMSI outside the 3GPP operator
domain is dependent on the operator policy.
NOTE 2: According to TS 33.223 [22] a public identity correspond uniquely to a
single private identity.
\- _Push delivery method_ : This can be left empty as the MTC-IWF will select
the trigger delivery method.
\- _Transport address (UE_trp)_ : This may be left empty as the MTC-IWF will
select the trigger delivery method. In case the UE_id is MSISDN the transport
address may indicate the same.
\- _BSF address_ : FQDN of the BSF.
\- _UICC application_ _to use_ : This is the Appl_Lbl if the UICC application
to use is not uniquely determined by the UE transport method and/or UE_Id.
\- _ME is GPL capable or not_ : ME needs to be GPL capable.
\- _UICC is GPL capable or not_ : UICC needs to be GPL capable when GPL
protected message is delivered to targeted UICC application (e.g. USIM).
\- _GPL_ME or GPL_U_ : GPL_ME or GPL_U when the GPL protected message is
delivered to targeted UICC application (e.g. USIM).
Editor\'s Note: This is FFS to determine what would be the applications that
need to rely on GPL_U to benefit from higher level of security.
1\. The SCS (acting as NAF) determines the need to use GBA Push in order to
establish common security associations in the SCS and UE for the purpose of
protecting the device trigger.
2\. The SCS sends a GPI request to the BSF as defined in TS 33.223 [22]. The
request is as defined in TS 33.223 [22] with the following profiling:
\- _UE_Id_type_ indicates public user identity, i.e. External Identifier or
MSISDN.
\- _Ua security protocol Id_ in the NAF-Id indicates GPL.
\- _U/M_ indicates the use of GBA_ME or GBA_U.
\- _GSID (GAA Service Id)_ indicates the service requesting use of GBA push.
NOTE 3: An appropriate value is ffs and needs to be registered in normative
phase. This could be e.g. \"MTC secure trigger\".
3\. The BSF processes the GPI request and contacts the HSS according to TS
33.223 [22].
4\. The BSF sends the GPI response including e.g. GPI and NAF keys to the SCS
according to TS 33.223 [22].
5\. The processing at the SCS is as follows:
\- The SCS creates the GPL-SA as defined in TS 33.224 [25].
\- The SCS creates the protected GPL message including the trigger payload in
the GPL payload as defined in TS 33.224 [25]. Combined GPL delivery is used,
i.e. the GPI is included in the GPL message.
NOTE 4: TS 33.224 [25] allows sending the GPI separately or combined with the
GPL message. Since it is specified in TS 23.682 [23] that the SCS sends a
(i.e. one) Device Trigger Request to the MTC-IWF and the transport method for
the device trigger is selected by the MTC-IWF, it is recommended that combined
delivery is used.
6\. When the SCS sends the Device Trigger Request to the MTC-IWF (in step 2 of
clause 5.2.1 in TS 23.682 [23]), the trigger payload includes the protected
GPL message. Within the Device Trigger Request the SCS also indicates to the
MTC-IWF that the trigger is protected. In case of trigger delivery using T4
this allows the MTC-IWF to select an appropriate SMS header parameter or other
parameter to differentiate the secure trigger from a normal trigger.
NOTE 5: An appropriate SMS header parameter or other parameter needs to be
decided by stage 3 groups in normative phase.
7\. The device trigger is transported to the UE as defined in TS 23.682 [23].
As the trigger may not fit into one SM the SMS-SC does any necessary
segmentation for larger messages.
8\. When the UE receives the device trigger, the trigger is destined to the
secure trigger application based on appropriate SMS header parameter or other
parameter indicating a secure trigger and indicate the used security protocol.
NOTE 6: An appropriate SMS header parameter or other parameter for application
secured MTC trigger needs to be decided by stage 3 groups in normative phase.
\- The GPL and GPI processing is performed as defined in TS 33.223 [22] and TS
33.224 [25].
\- After this any information contained within the trigger payload is
forwarded to the related or addressed UE‑application as specified in TS 23.682
[23].
\- The keys resulting from GPI processing can also be used protect further
application layer communication (i.e. to provide a Secure Connection) between
the UE and SCS.
##### 5.1.4.2.7 Solution 6: Secure Trigger Delivery with Security Association
between MTC-IWF and UE
Application level security is out-of-scope of 3GPP SA3 activity thus only way
to deliver a trigger securely is to secure all hops between the SCS and the
UE. One of the solution is to have security association between the MTC-IWF
and the UE. The MTC-IWF will verify whether Tsp is secured and then send the
trigger together to the UE.
The detail solution for establishing the security association between MTC-IWF
and UE is given in clause 5.7.4.4.
##### 5.1.4.2.8 Solution 7: Using regular GBA and GPL to secure Device
triggering procedure over Tsp and T4
Editor\'s Note: This is an example for Tsp and T4. It is FFS how this solution
can be generalized to cover also Tsms case and entities other than the SCS
applying the regular GBA and GPL security.
End to end protection of the device trigger is regarded to be provided at the
application layer between the MTC application in the UE and MTC application in
the application server and therefore be out of scope for 3GPP specifications.
When the device trigger protection is applied between the SCS and UE, then
3GPP is able to provide a trigger transport service to the SCS. This can be
regarded as another value added service that the SCS offers to the MTC
application servers in addition to any other value added services that the SCS
provides.
In case GBA is used to provide device trigger protection between the SCS and
UE, the SCS takes the role of NAF. The following describes how regular GBA as
defined in TS 33.220 [21] and Generic Push Layer as defined in TS 33.224 [25]
with extensions as explained below can be used to protect the device trigger
between the SCS and the UE. The UE and SCS may have run regular GBA
bootstrapping for example as a result of having set up a Secure Connection
between the UE and SCS.
Figure 5.1.4.2.8-1: Security for Device triggering procedure using regular GBA
and GPL\ over Tsp and T4
The following steps are performed following the Device triggering procedure
over Tsp in clause 5.2.1 of TS 23.682 [23].
**Precondition:** To be able to use regular GBA -based services together with
GPL the SCS needs to be provided with the following information regarding the
UE. The information below is based on the information needed for GBApush in
Solution 5. The mechanism how the information is provided is out of the scope
of the present document.
\- _UE_id_ : This is the External Identifier specified in TS 23.682 [23] or
MSISDN.
NOTE 1: According to TS 23.682 [23] the use of IMSI outside the 3GPP operator
domain is dependent on the operator policy.
According to TS 33.223 [22] a public user identity (External identifier or
MSISDN) corresponds uniquely to a single private user identity (IMSI or IMPI).
This restriction also applies in this solution even though GBA push is not
used.
If MSISDN is used as delivery address, then the USIM associated with that
MSISDN should be used. This is so because a SMS will only reach the UE when
the USIM corresponding to the MSISDN is active in the UE.
\- _Push delivery method_ : This information is not needed for this solution
as the MTC-IWF will select the trigger delivery method.
\- _Transport address (UE_trp)_ : This information is not needed as the MTC-
IWF will select the trigger delivery method.
\- _BSF address_ : FQDN of the BSF.
\- _ME is GPL capable or not_ : ME needs to be GPL capable.
_\- UICC is GPL capable or not_ : UICC needs to be GPL capable when the GPL
protected message is delivered to targeted UICC application (e.g. USIM).
\- _GPL_ME or GPL_U_ : GPL_ME ME or GPL_U when the GPL protected message is
delivered to targeted UICC application (e.g. USIM).
Editor\'s Note: This is FFS to determine what would be the applications that
need to rely on GPL_U to benefit from higher level of security.
\- _ME is regular GBA capable or not_ : ME needs to be regular GBA capable.
Whether the UE is regular GBA capable or not can be an optional configuration
parameter in the SCS.
The UE is assumed to have run regular bootstrapping with BSF as shown in steps
1 -- 4 for example as a result of having set up a Secure Connection between
the UE and SCS.
1\. The UE requests bootstrapping via the Ub interface with the BSF in regular
GBA as described in TS 33.220 [21].
2\. The BSF processes the GBA request from the UE as described in TS 33.220
[21].
3\. The BSF retrieves AV and user profile from HSS as described in TS 33.220
[21].
4 The BSF and UE perform Ub run as described in TS 33.220 [21].
5\. The SCS determines the need to trigger the device, e.g. due to that the
MTC application server requested the SCS to trigger the device using GBA to
protect the trigger. The SCS (acting as a NAF) determines the need to contact
the BSF to find out if common security associations have been established in
the BSF and UE in regular GBA, for the purpose of protecting the device
trigger in GPL with these security associations.
6\. The SCS send a Zn interface request to the BSF as defined in TS 33.220
[21] including Public User Identity (External Identifier or MSISDN) instead of
B-TID. The request is defined with the following profiling:
Editor\'s Note: It needs to be clarified that the B-TID can be left out from
the message exchange.
\- _UE_Id_type_ indicates public user identity (External Identifier or
MSISDN).
\- _Ua security protocol Id_ in the NAF-Id indicates GPL.
\- _GSID (GAA Service Id)_ indicates the service requesting use of GBA.
Editor\'s Note: An appropriate value is ffs and needs to be registered in TS
29.109 [37]. This could be e.g. \"MTC secure trigger\".
7 The BSF processes the modified Zn interface request and if the BSF has
common security associations established with this UE as identified in the Zn
request, then the BSF sends the modified Zn response to the SCS (NAF)
including, NAF keys (Ks_(ext/int)_NAF) and other security information to the
SCS according to TS 33.220 [21] and extended with the B-TID.
8\. When the SCS receives the Zn response including the B-TID from the BSF,
then the processing at the SCS is as follows:
\- The SCS creates the GPL-SA by assigning the RAND\@NAF-Id as the downlink
security association identifier (DL SAID) in the GPL-SA. RAND is received from
the B-TID. The UL GPL SAID is set to the same value as the DL GPL SAID.
NOTE 2: The DL GPL SA ID takes the form RAND\@NAF-Id instead of RAND@\'naf\'
defined in TS 33.223 [22] in order to provide the UE with NAF-Id for _the
Ks_(int)_NAF computation_.
\- The SCS creates the protected GPL message including the trigger payload in
the GPL payload as defined in TS 33.224 [25]. Since SCS is re-using an
existing bootstrapping run in this case, combined GPL delivery cannot be used,
i.e. the GPI cannot be included in the GPL message.
9\. When the SCS sends the Device Trigger Request to the MTC-IWF (clause 5.2.1
in TS 23.682 [23]), the trigger payload includes the protected GPL message.
Within the Device Trigger Request the SCS also indicates to the MTC-IWF that
the trigger is protected. In case of trigger delivery using T4 this allows the
MTC-IWF to select an appropriate SMS header parameter or other parameter to
differentiate the secure trigger from a normal trigger.
NOTE 3: An appropriate SMS header parameter or other parameter needs to be
decided by stage 3 groups in normative phase.
10\. The device trigger is transported to the UE as defined in TS 23.682 [23].
As the trigger may not fit into one SMS the SMS-SC does any necessary
segmentation for larger messages.
11\. When the UE receives the device trigger, the trigger is destined to the
secure trigger application based on appropriate SMS header parameter or other
parameter indicating a secure trigger and indicate the used security protocol.
NOTE 4: An appropriate SMS header parameter or other parameter for application
secured MTC trigger needs to be decided by stage 3 groups in normative phase.
  * The secure trigger application in the UE _prepares a NAF SA by computing the Ks_(int)_NAF from the Ks (established from regular GBA) identified by the RAND part in the_ downlink security association identifier _in GPL. The NAF-Id for the Ks_(int)_NAF computation is received from the domain part of the DL GPL SA ID._
\- The UE initializes the GPL SA and processes the GPL as described in fin TS
33.224 [25].
\- After this any information contained within the trigger payload is
forwarded to the related or addressed UE‑application as specified in TS 23.682
[23].
##### 5.1.4.2.9 Solution 8: Using GBA Push to secure Device triggering
procedure over Tsms
When entities other than the SCS apply GBA push security for device triggering
(i.e. an SME in the generic case) over Tsms, the protection of the device
trigger happens end-to-end on application level and therefore the exact
security protocol and other mechanisms to protect the device trigger are out
of scope of 3GPP. However, 3GPP can provide GBA push-based keys used for the
protection. This, in fact, is in practice the same as setting up a Secure
Connection with GBApush between the generic SME and UE from 3GPP perspective.
The flow below illustrates how GBA push can be used to provide keys for
protection of device trigger (and also to protect other application level
communication) between the UE and an SME. SME act as a push-NAF. It should be
noted that the MTC Application Server also may take the role of SME and send a
device trigger over Tsms.
Figure 5.1.4.2.9-1: Security for Device triggering procedure over Tsms
The following steps may be performed before step 2 in the Device triggering
procedure over Tsp in clause 5.2.1.
**Precondition:** To be able to use GBA push -based services the SME acting as
a push-NAF needs to be provided with the following information regarding the
UE as is defined in Annex B of TS 33.223 [22]. The mechanism how the
information is provided is out of the scope of the present document.
\- _UE_id_ : This is the MSISDN.
NOTE 1: According to TS 23.682 [23] the use of IMSI outside the 3GPP operator
domain is dependent on the operator policy.
NOTE 2: According to TS 33.223 [22] a public identity corresponds uniquely to
a single private identity.
\- _Push delivery method_ : This is set to SMS.
\- _Transport address (UE_trp)_ : This is set to External Identifier or MSISDN
In case the UE_id is MSISDN the transport address may indicate the same.
\- _BSF address_ : FQDN of the BSF
\- _UICC application_ _to use_ : This field may be left empty as the UICC
application to use is uniquely determined by the UE transport method (i.e.
SMS) and/or UE_Id (External Identifier or MSISDN).
NOTE 3: Since the security protocol to be used for protecting the device
trigger is decided by the MTC application, the configuration information
related to the security protocol is out of scope of 3GPP. However, if the MTC
application decides to use, e.g. GPL, then the configuration considerations
related to GPL from solution 5 \"Using GBA Push to secure Device triggering
procedure over Tsp and T4\" would apply also here.
1\. The SME (acting as push-NAF) determines the need to use GBA Push for the
purpose of protecting the device trigger.
2\. The SME sends a GPI request to the BSF as defined in TS 33.223 [22]. The
request is as defined in TS 33.223 [22] with the following profiling:
\- _UE_Id_type_ indicates public user identity, i.e. External Identifier or
MSISDN.
\- _Ua security protocol Id_ in the NAF-Id indicates the used security
protocol.
\- _U/M_ indicates the use of GBA_ME or GBA_U.
\- _GSID (GAA Service Id)_ indicates the service requesting use of GBA push.
NOTE 4: An appropriate value is ffs and needs to be registered in TS 29.109
[37] in normative phase.
3\. The BSF processes the GPI request and contacts the HSS according to TS
33.223 [22].
4\. The BSF sends the GPI response including e.g. GPI and NAF keys to the SME
according to TS 33.223 [22].
5\. The SME stores the received information from the BSF in a NAF SA as
described in TS 33.223 [22].
6\. The SME uses the NAF SA to protect the device trigger. Any suitable
protocol chosen by the MTC Application Server, for example GPL as defined in
TS 33.224 [25], could be used.
\- Depending on the used security protocol or other considerations, combined
or separate GPI delivery is used. This is out of scope of 3GPP and eventually
for the SME to decide.
7\. When the SME sends the Device Trigger SMS to the SMS-SC, the trigger
payload includes the protected message. Protection is indicated by means of
the MTC application which are not visible to lower layers.
8\. The device trigger is transported to the UE via SMS architecture. Trigger
SMS filtering as defined in TS 23.682 [23] may be applied on the way. As the
trigger may not fit into one SM the SMS-SC does any necessary segmentation for
larger messages.
9\. When the UE receives the device trigger, the trigger is destined to the
MTC application based on the SMS header parameter or other parameter.
NOTE 5: An appropriate SMS header parameter or other parameter for application
secured MTC trigger needs to be decided by stage 3 groups in normative phase.
\- The GPI processing is performed as defined in TS 33.223 [22].
\- After this any information contained within the trigger payload is
processed by the MTC application.
##### 5.1.4.2.10 Impacts on existing nodes or functionality
**Solution 2:**
  * SMS-SC needs to differentiate the regular SMS from trigger SMS.
  * SMS-GMSC/IP-SM-GW needs to differentiate the regular SMS from trigger SMS.
  * HSS needs to store MTC related subscription data (i.e. whether a target UE is UE used only for MTC or not) and needs to judge whether a target UE is UE used only for MTC or not because SA2 has not defined this functionality for HSS.
  * The interface between SMS-SC and SMS-GMSC and C/Sh/G interface needs to support the check indication during normal SMS procedure.
**Solution 3-A: Network based SMS payload filtering:**
  * SMS-SC needs to differentiate the regular SMS and trigger SMS
  * SMS-SC needs to support as SMS whitelist filtering based on TP Protocol Id to distinguish whether SMS is triggering or not.
**Solution 3-B: UE based SMSC whitelisting:**
  * UE needs to support SMSC whitelist.
  * SMS filtering needs to be supported by the whitelisted HPLMN SMSCs.
### 5.1.5 Evaluation
The following provides an evaluation of Device Triggering mechanisms on each
interface. It does not take into account possible end to end protection of DT.
**External interface:**
_T4 solution_ : Trigger indication is sent over Tsp from MTC server to MTC-
IWF. Requirements exist in the current document that MTC-IWF should verify the
integrity of the device trigger and that it is sent by an authorized source.
This could be achieved with the help of the MTC-SEG. Checking a received
device trigger that has come over the T4 to SMSC should not be a problem as
MTC-IWF and SMSC are within the same operator.
Additionally, the MTC server may send a device trigger over Tsms to SMSC. This
poses the problem identified in the current document \"_SMS-SC is required to
distinguish ordinary short messages from short messages for triggering
unattended UEs and act accordingly (e.g. selectively block)._ \" The TP
Protocol Id in the SM header is used to distinguish a device trigger SM from
an ordinary SM in the SMS-SC (see for further details in TS 23.040 [43]). A
new TP-PID value to identify a device trigger SM was defined for this purpose.
The TP Protocol Id is conveyed all the way to the UE, and it can be used by
the intermediate nodes as well as the UE to distinguish ordinary short
messages from short messages for triggering. The SMSC should then check
incoming SMSs and accept device trigger SMSs only from authorized MTC servers.
This approach requires that the SMS infrastructure can filter based on SMS
headers for all SMS from untrusted sources. This could be achieved with the
help of the MTC-SEG.
_T5 solution_ : Tsp interface is the same for T4 solution and T5 solution.
Therefore the same considerations apply.
_UP solution:_ Trigger UP message is sent over Gi/SGi from MTC server to
GGSN/PGW. This seems to pose a requirement that the GGSN/PGW would need to
filter out unauthorized triggers. This could be achieved by only allowing
traffic to the UE from an authorized MTC server (which is assumed not to send
false triggers) Alternatively achieving the requirement would require that
trigger UP messages can be distinguished from other user plane data messages
over Gi/SGi, and the GGSN/PGW would need to possibly check all incoming
traffic over Gi/SGi and filter out unauthorized trigger UP messages. The
latter seems a major task to do.
**Interface between home and serving network:**
_T4 solution_ : The trigger SMS is sent from SMSC as follows: to MME via MSC
in LTE, to SGSN in PS UTRAN, to SGSN in GPRS. This also poses the problem that
the serving network node is required to distinguish ordinary short messages
from short messages for triggering unattended UEs and act accordingly (e.g.
selectively block). The TP Protocol Id in the SM header is used to distinguish
a device trigger SM from an ordinary SM in the SMS-SC (see for further details
in TS 23.040 [43]). A new TP-PID value to identify a device trigger SM was
defined for this purpose. The TP Protocol Id is conveyed all the way to the
UE, and it can be used by the intermediate nodes as well as the UE to
distinguish ordinary short messages from short messages for triggering. The
MME/SGSN in the serving network should then check incoming SMSs and accept
device trigger SMSs only from an authorized source (e.g. SMSC) in the HPLMN.
Checking a received device trigger SMSM should not be a problem when MME/SGSN
and SMSC are within the same operator. This approach requires that the SMS
infrastructure can filter based on SMS headers for all SMS from untrusted
sources.
It seems additional measures may be needed in case of roaming to do the check.
One possible solution is that trigger SMSs are always sent home routed via a
dedicated SMSC. Then the MME/SGSN node, when it receives a trigger SMS,
contacts the UEs HSS to get information about whether the trigger SMS was sent
by an authorized source in the HPLMN. If the received information from the HSS
matches the source information in the trigger SMS, the trigger SMS is
forwarded to the UE. The requested information could include, e.g. address of
the authorized SMSC, information if there is an outstanding trigger SMS for
the UE, or the even the reference number of the trigger SMS.
_T5 solution_ : SA2 is discussing two options: Device trigger can be sent over
T5 as an SMS or as a generic signaling message. In case of SMS the same
considerations apply as for T4 solution above with the exception that the
source node is MTC-IWF and not SMSC. In case of generic signaling message is
used it seems that \"additional\" checking is not needed when the trigger
message is sent as a generic signaling message as it can be regarded as a
normal signalling message and existing protection mechanisms for signalling
messages should apply.
_UP solution:_ Trigger UP message is sent from GGSN/PGW to SGSN/SGW. If
filtering was not done at the GGSN/PGW, this would require that trigger UP
messages can be distinguished from other user plane data messages at SGSN/SGW,
and the SGSN/SGW would need to possibly check all incoming traffic and filter
out unauthorized trigger UP messages. This seems a major task to do.
**Radio interface:**
_T4 solution_ : Device trigger is sent as MT SMS. MT SMS in control plane is
integrity protected in LTE and UTRAN but not in GERAN. MT IP-SMS (if
applicable) does not provide integrity protection in any network.
_T5 solution_ : Device trigger is sent as MT SMS or a NAS message (SA2 is
discussing two options). In case MT SMS the same considerations as for T4
solution apply. In case of a NAS transport, NAS message in control plane is
integrity protected in LTE and UTRAN but not in GERAN.
_UP solution_ : Device trigger is sent over user plane. Integrity protection
is not provided for user plane in any RAN.
**The evaluation of the solutions is as following:**
Editor\'s note: Even if the network charges the source of the device trigger
message, there is still a potential charging integrity concern. For example,
events at the device subsequent to the fake trigger e.g. send SMS, Send Data,
may create disputed chargeable events on the devices subscription. This threat
needs to be considered and evaluated.
##### Solution 1: Triggering via NAS signalling {#solution-1-triggering-via-
nas-signalling-1 .H6}
It has 3 benefits to use this solution, first, both NAS signalling messages
and SMS messages over NAS signalling can be integrity-protected. Secondly,
core network can verify MTC server and UE can verify and trust core network
after authentication. As a result, the trusted source verification can be
achieved by the UE based on core network verification. Thirdly, it re uses the
current existing mechanism to provide this protection and does not need to
deploy new security elements etc. In a word, this solution is simply and
secure.
##### Solution 2: Solution for fake SMS triggering from normal UE in the same
network as UE used only for MTC {#solution-2-solution-for-fake-sms-triggering-
from-normal-ue-in-the-same-network-as-ue-used-only-for-mtc-1 .H6}
Solution 2 needs improvements on SMS-SC, SMS-GMSC/IP-SM-GW, HSS, the interface
between SMS-SC and SMS-GMSC and C/Sh/G interface, so it has wide impacts on
existing network entities.
Solution 2 actually disables UE sending normal SMS to UEs used only for MTC,
while the architecture for MTC defined by SA2 allows any network entity acting
as SME to send SMS, so it is not compliant with SA2\'s conclusion.
From user view, this solution limits the network service that can be provided
to the user and have negative impact on user experience because user UE cannot
send SMS to MTC user then.
One step further, as SMS is a possible and efficient way for MTC small data
transmission, if MT SMS from UE is prohibited, it will have significant
influence on the network enhancement for small data transmission in the
future.
##### Solution 3: {#solution-3 .H6}
> **3-A: Network based SMS payload filtering:**
Benefits:
\- This solution has low impacts on existing network entities, since whitelist
based SMS filtering is supported by current SMS system.
\- If a SMS spoofing happens, the SMS delivery can be terminated immediately
by the network, network resource can be saved.
Drawbacks:
\- Network node should inspect all received SMSs based on TP Protocol ID which
will increase network processing load. One alternative way is that the HSS
would check the TP Protocol ID for all received SMSs, because it can do the
authorization per UE and also it is very accurate check. But HSS check will
increase the load in the HSS since SME number will be very large compared to
SCS number in the Tsp interface.
\- Protection against SMS spoofing depends on home network if the HPLMN
implements home network routing for SMS.
\- Due to the size limit of whitelist maintained by SMS-SC, the granularity of
whitelist is coarse-grained.
> **3-B: UE based SMSC whitelisting:**
Benefits:
\- Regardless of the routing way (HPLMN routing or VPLMN routing), protection
against SMS spoofing can be provided.
Drawbacks:
\- Configuration and modification of the whitelist on UE are difficult.
\- UE used only for MTC is usually power sensitive or energy restricted, so
this solution can introduce more energy consumption to the device whatever
maintaining a whitelist or USIM application toolkit or GBA push.
\- The granularity of this mechanism depends on the SMS filtering granularity
supported by SMSC.
\- Further details are needed (this sentence can be placed into the original
solution section).
> **3-C: GBA Push based approach**
For this solution, the benefit is the mutual authentication between the UE and
the MTC Server can be achieved. But it has the following problem:
\- The specific BSF Server for SIMTC needs to be deployed in the operator\'s
network. Currently, some operator does not deploy the BSF Server.
**R11 MTC Trigger Security Optional Solution Analysis:**
R11 MTC Trigger Security Optional Solution is in TS 23.682 [23]. There are
some constraints of this R11 MTC trigger security solution which list below.
_Home routing: R11_ solution mandates the HPLMN implement Home Network Routing
which has the effect of forcing the delivery of the SMS to an SMS Router in
the HPLMN rather than to the serving MSC/VLR, SGSN or MME of the destination
UE. It\'s the normal standardized procedure that SMS routes from its SMS-SC to
the target\'s MSC/VLR, SGSN or MME. Home routing forces every two operators
has to have agreements to send their SMS to the target\'s SMS router or SMS-
SC, not legacy SMS routing. This constraint requires operator\'s HPLMN
supports new SMS routing path.
_Filtering infrastructure:_ This filtering infra is used to block unauthorized
SME to send trigger messages. However, how the solution to let filtering infra
authorize SME according to the trigger SMS is not clear since it should not be
stated in TS 23.682 [23] and it should be studied in SA3\'s TS in R12. In
common understanding, a whitelist is used to check the authorized SME.
However, the granularity of this whitelist should be studied and stated in the
solution to make the solution completed. Operators have to maintain such a
filtering infra to support this R11 solution.
In NOTE 2 of this solution (S3-120543), \"filtering is distributed between
filtering infrastructure associated with the SMS Router, filtering
infrastructure associated with the SMS-SC, and the filtering functions within
the MTC-IWF\". It also stated a constraint \"the filtering needs to be invoked
by an entity which can verify the source of the SM on a locally connected
interface\". That means SMS router, or SMS-SC or MTC-IWF has to support
verifying the source of the SMS. SMS router does not have such capability.
SMS-SC and MTC-IWF do not have this capability unless they have all the
possible subscription/whitelist of SME who can send trigger message. Filtering
infra may have this capability but the problem is the same that the filtering
infra should know maintain the completed whitelist/subscription of the source
of trigger messages. Moreover, a locally connected interface should be
supported by the operators but it probably may be an internal interface and
needs no standardization. But the mechanism of how the NE invokes the
filtering and verify the source of the SM on a locally connected interface
should be studied further.
## 5.2 Secure Connection
### 5.2.1 Issue Details
\- The MTC Feature Secure Connection is intended for use with UEs that require
a secure connection between the UE and SCS in indirect model or between the UE
and MTC Application Server in direct model.
\- In the context of MTC Feature Secure connection SA1 has stated the
following (S3-100412):
\- _The intention of the MTC Feature Secure Connection is to use the security
features of the UICC to enable an exchange of security keys between the MTC
Device and MTC Server. The actual encryption of data between the MTC Device
and MTC Server would happen at application layer and be out of scope of 3GPP
specifications._
\- In TS 22.368 [9] the requirement on secure connection is stated as follows:
> _The network operator shall be able to efficiently provide network security
> for connection between MTC Device and a MTC Server or between MTC Device and
> a MTC Application Server in case there is a direct connection with the MTC
> Application Server. This applies even when some of the devices are roaming
> i.e. connected via a VPLMN._
Editor\'s Note: It needs to be decided that network efficiency should be a
general security requirement for all SIMTC issues.
\- The actual usage of the security keys for securing the application level
functionality (including encryption of data as indicated above) between UE and
SCS/MTC Application Server is out of scope of 3GPP specifications.
\- Also other mechanisms can be used to provide security between the UE and
SCS/MTC Application Server but they are regarded to be outside the context of
the MTC Secure Connection feature and therefore out of scope of 3GPP
specifications.
### 5.2.2 Threats
### 5.2.3 Security Requirements
Any 3GPP defined key management mechanisms for secure connection between the
UE and the MTC Server/MTC Application Server should use UICC.
### 5.2.4 Solutions
#### 5.2.4.1 GBA based solution
##### 5.2.4.1.1 UE initiated Secure Connection based on GBA
GBA, as specified in TS 33.220 [21], is used to bootstrap authentication and
key agreement for application security based on the 3GPP AKA mechanism. It can
be used to establish the end-to-end security and provide different security
levels based on detailed requirements.
The flow illustrates how GBA can be used to establish a UE-initiated Secure
Connection (i.e. keys for application security) between the UE and SCS
(indirect model) or between the UE and MTC Application Server (direct model).
The flows for both models are depicted in one flow since the flows are equal.
SCS and MTC Application Server act as a NAF.
Figure 5.2.4.1.1-1: Security for the Secure Connection established with GBA
based solution
Steps from 1 to 10 illustrate the bootstrapping between the UE and BSF as
specified in TS 33.220 [21].
Steps from 11 to 16 illustrate how the NAF specific keys derived from the
bootstrapped Ks can be used to secure a generic UE-initiated MTC application
protocol (i.e. a Ua application protocol in GBA terminology) between UE and
the MTC Application Server, or between the UE and SCS. It should be noted that
relevant in these steps is the key management since the actual use of the keys
to protect the communication is left outside the scope of 3GPP.
1\. The UE requests bootstrapping via the Ub interface with the BSF in regular
GBA as described in TS 33.220 [21].
2\. The BSF processes the GBA request from the UE as described in TS 33.220
[21].
3\. The BSF retrieves AV and user profile from HSS as described in TS 33.220
[21].
4\. The BSF forwards the RAND and AUTN to the UE as described in TS 33.220
[21].
5\. The client in the UE runs AKA algorithm, verifies AUTN and derives CK, IK
and RES as described in TS 33.220 [21].
6\. The UE sends another request containing the Digest AKA response
(calculated using RES), to the BSF as described in TS 33.220 [21].
7\. The BSF authenticates the UE by verifying the Digest AKA response as
described in TS 33.220 [21].
8\. The BSF generates Ks by concatenating CK and IK as described in TS 33.220
[21].
9\. The BSF sends a B-TID and the lifetime of the key Ks as described in TS
33.220 [21].
10\. The UE generates Ks by concatenating CK and IK as described in TS 33.220
[21].
11\. The UE uses the Ks to derive the key material Ks (ext/int)_NAF as
described in TS 33.220 [21].The key Ks_(ext/int)_NAF is used for securing the
reference point Ua (between UE and SCS server; or between UE and MTC
Application Server).
12\. The UE starts communication over the reference point Ua with the NAF
(i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) using the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF to protect the
communication and the B-TID as the key identifier.
13\. The NAF (i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) starts communication with
the BSF and requests key material corresponding to the B-TID supplied by the
UE to the NAF.
14\. The BSF identifies the Ks corresponding to the B-TID supplied by the NAF
and the BSF uses the Ks to derive the key material Ks_(ext/int)_NAF as
described in TS 33.220 [21].
15\. The BSF supplies to the NAF (i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) the
requested key Ks_(ext/int)_NAF and the key lifetime as described in TS 33.220
[21].
16\. The NAF (i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) can communication securely
with the UE.
##### 5.2.4.1.2 Network initiated Secure Connection based on GBApush
GBA Push, as specified in TS 33.223 [22], can be used for network initiated
key establishing between an UE and an SCS/MTC Application Server. Under MTC
scenario, UE generates a NAF key derived from the bootstrap key Ks, and
SCS/MTC Application Server acts as NAF which received the NAF key from the
BSF. Then UE and SCS/MTC Application Server can set up Secure Connection based
on this shared NAF key.
Figure 5.2.4.1.2-1: Security for the Secure Connection established with
GBAPush based solution
The flow illustrates how GBA push can be used to establish a network-initiated
Secure Connection (i.e. keys for application security) between the UE and SCS
(indirect model) or MTC Application Server (direct model). SCS and MTC
Application Server act as a push-NAF. The flows for both models are depicted
in one flow since the flows are equal.
1.The SCS (acting as NAF) or the MTC Application (acting as NAF) determines
the need to use GBA Push in order to establish common security associations
(NAF SA\'s) in the SCS and UE; or in the MTC Application Server and UE as
described in TS 33.223 [22].
2\. The SCS or MTC Application Server sends a GPI request to the BSF as
defined in TS 33.223 [22].
3\. The BSF processes the GPI request as described in TS 33.223 [22].
4a and 4b. The BSF contacts the HSS as described in TS 33.223 [22] and
retrieves AV\'s from the HSS.
5\. The BSF generates the GPI as described in TS 33.223 [22].
6\. The BSF sends the GPI response including e.g. GPI and NAF keys to the NAF
(i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) as described in TS 33.223 [22].
7\. The NAF (i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) stores the received
information from the BSF in a NAF SA as described in TS 33.223 [22].
8\. The NAF (i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) forwards the GPI to the UE
using the selected transport mechanism and the given transport address.
There are alternatives how the GPI could be sent to the UE.
If the NAF (SCS or MTC Application Server) does not have IP connectivity with
the UE, the GPI could be sent as part of the device trigger to the UE via the
Tsp in case of SCS and via Tsms in case of MTC Application Server (acting as
SME). In this case the GPI could serve two purposes, it could be used to
protect the device trigger (as is described in solutions using GBA to protect
the device trigger in the present document) and it could be also be used to
provide keys for the Secure Connection.
If the NAF (SCS or MTC Application Server) has IP connectivity with the UE,
the GPI could be sent within the application protocol that the MTC application
uses and used to provide keys for the Secure Connection.
9\. The UE processes GPI as described in TS 33.223 [22] and stores the
information in a NAF SA.
10\. The UE and the NAF (i.e. SCS or MTC Application Server) are now ready to
communicate and use the established NAF SA for both UE and network-initiated
MTC application communication (i.e. for a Ua application protocol in GBA
terminology).
#### 5.2.4.2 EAP based solution
##### 5.2.4.2.1 IKEv2 based solution
When UE connects to the network, it will get an IP address for PS
communication. Under this scenario, so IKEv2 or some other kinds of IP
security protocol which can be used to carry EAP methods, can be used for
establish the communication keys between UE and MTC service capability server.
Note: EAP-AKA can be carried over other protocols, for example IKEv2 or other
lightweight can be used protocol. But here it is just emphasizes to use the
EAP-AKA protocol.
In order to use the security features of the UICC to enable an exchange of
security keys, an EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA method can be embedded into carrying
protocol\'s procedure. The whole procedure can be as following:
Figure 5.2.4.2.1-1
1\. UE establishes the connection with MTC server.
2\. When UE wants to generate session keys with MTC server, it sends IKEv2
initialization message to MTC server.
3\. After receiving IKEv2 initial message, MTC server will start the secure
connection procedure and send IKEv2 initial response message back to UE.
4\. UE sends IKE_AUTH message to MTC server. The message does not contain AUTH
payload to trigger EAP procedure.
5\. MTC server sends IKEv2 message with EAP payload for requesting the UE\'s
identity.
6\. UE sends back identity embedded into IKEv2 message.
7\. MTC server forwards UE\'s identity by using EAP message to 3GPP AAA
server.
8a. 3GPP AAA server send authentication vector request with UE\'s identity to
HSS.
8b. HSS generates authentication vector based on UE\'s identity and its root
key.
8c. HSS sends back authentication vector to the 3GPP AAA server.
9\. 3GPP AAA server calculates the MSK based on the CK/IK inside the
authentication vector.
10\. 3GPP AAA server sends authentication request inside EAP message to MTC
server.
11\. MTC server encapsulates such EAP message into IKEv2 message and sends it
out to UE.
12\. After receiving the message, UE will run AKA algorithm to verify the AUTN
and generates RES and MSK which is same with 3GPP AAA server. MSK will be used
for secure connection.
13\. UE creates EAP message, which carries AKA response information and
encapsulates it into IKEv2 message and sends to MTC server.
14\. MTC server forwards EAP message to 3GPP AAA server.
15\. 3GPP AAA server verifies the RES contained in EAP message with XRES.
16\. If the verification is success, 3GPP AAA server sends the MSK to MTC
server with EAP-success message.
17\. When received EAP-success message, MTC server knows the authentication is
succeeded, then it extracts MSK for secure connection and sends IKEv2
authentication message with EAP-success message.
18\. UE sends IKEv2 authentication message to MTC server.
19\. MTC server sends IEKv2 AUTH message back to UE, and finish the procedure.
After the procedure, UE can get the MSK in step 12. In step 9, the same MSK
can be calculated in 3GPP AAA server. In the next step 16, the MSK can be
transferred from 3GPP AAA server to MTC server who is used for application
usage.
Editor\'s Note: It needs check with SA2 whether there is an interface between
the MTC server and the 3GPP AAA server.
##### 5.2.4.2.2 EAP/PANA based Solution:
ETSI M2M specification [27] specifies EAP-based M2M Service Bootstrap
procedure using EAP-SIM [28] with EAP/PANA or using EAP-AKA [29], [30] with
EAP/PANA [31]. In order to harmonize with other SDOs for secure connection,
mechanism using EAP/PANA using SIM or AKA-based credentials to be considered
as potential solution for secure connection. When EAP/PANA based approached is
used, the UE will support PANA Client (PaC) functionality and the SCS will
support the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) functionality.
### 5.2.5 Evaluation
#### 5.2.5.0 General
In order to evaluate the solution for secure connection, it proposes to make
evaluation based on the criteria as: use case, security, cost, protocol
dependency, network and architectural impact and roaming.
#### 5.2.5.1 Evaluation for GBA/GBA push based solution:
1) Use cases: GBA is triggered by UE only, so it can be applied in the
scenario when a secure connection procedure is triggered by UE. If the secure
connection starts from network side, GBA push can be used instead of GBA.
Furthermore, GBA and GBA push mechanisms will use 3GPP AKA mechanism that will
involve UICC and network entity to generate security keys. All the use cases,
i.e. when the Secure Connection is established to the MTC Server inside or
outside operator domain or to the MTC application server can be supported by
GBA and GBA push today as needed interfaces (e.g. Zn and Zpn) are specified in
current GBA specifications.
2) Security: GBA/GBA push use AKA mechanism and mechanisms for Zn interface,
as defined in TS 33.220 [21]. Ua application specific specifications define
the security of the Ua reference point. As a result, GBA / GBA push mechanism
can effectively provide security protection for the exchange of security keys
between UE and MTC server (inside or outside operator domain) or between the
UE and the MTC application server.
3) Cost: In the network side, MTC server and MTC application server need to
support NAF features, and a BSF should be deployed. In the terminal side, the
ME needs to support the GBA bootstrapping function and appropriate Ua
application. Furthermore, a GBA-aware ME should support both GBA_U and GBA_ME
procedures.
Terminal supporting: The support depends on the capabilities of the device and
its operating system.
Protocol dependency:
**Protocol dependency on Ua:** Use of the Ks (ext/int)_NAF to secure a Ua
protocol is Ua application specific, i.e. Ua interface is protocol independent
as in principle GBA keys could be used to secure any Ua security protocol.\ \
**Protocol dependency on Ub:** _Currently specified GBA bootstrapping variants
except GBApush use HTTP protocol as a transport for running the
bootstrapping..\ \ The use of CoAP can be seen as a new use case or
requirement for GBA, which is not supported by the current HTTP-based GBA
bootstrapping variants. It could be useful to make GBA available also to such
environments where CoAP is used, but HTTP is not. This would mean specifying
how GBA bootstrapping (e.g. based on 3G AKA) is run on top of CoAP instead of
on top of HTTP.\ \ It should be noted that constrained devices (e.g. devices
running an 8-bit processor) may also support for HTTP. For example, there
exists_ an open source OS for IoT which is called Contiki (www.contiki-
os.org). It includes a TCP/IP networking stack and implements HTTP and runs on
8-bit processors.
1) Network and architectural impacts: All interfaces defined for GBA should be
applied between UE and MTC Server/application server. There is no need to
deploy new feature on existing network entity, and no influence for protocol.
So it has little impact for the existing network.
2) Protocol overhead: It depends on the specific protocol which is used to
carry GBA/GBA push method, such as TCP, TLS, and HTTP.
3) Roaming: GBA architecture is agnostic to whether the device is roaming or
not.
#### 5.2.5.2 Evaluation for EAP-AKA method:
1) Use cases: Depending on the capabilities of the underlying protocol bothUE
and MTC server can be made to trigger secure connection procedure. EAP-AKA can
involve UICC and network entity to generate security keys.
2) Security: EAP-AKA method uses AKA mechanism embedded in EAP framework. The
security protection is based on AKA. AKA protocol can resist attacking like
replay, eavesdropping, tampering and any others. The security of the key
exchange and authorization between MTC server (inside or outside operator
domain) and 3GPP AAA server, or between the MTC Application server and 3GPP
AAA Server is not defined, but it can be made through a secure channel, so the
key will not be disclosed in this interface.
3) Cost: When using IKEv2 to carry EAP-AKA method as an example, the network
entity needs to support IKEv2 function and EAP-AKA. In the terminal side, UE
need to support theIKEv2 and EAP-AKA function mechanism. The 3GPP AAA server
needs to support new interfaces to the MTC Server and MTC application server.
4) Terminal supporting: The support depends on the capabilities of the device
and its operating system.
5) Protocol dependency: EAP-AKA can\'t be used directly between UE and MTC
server. It needs some protocols to carry EAP-AKA message.
6) Network and architectural impacts: New interfaces between MTC server
(inside and outside operator domain) and 3GPP AAA server, and between MTC
Application Server and 3GPP AAA server need to be defined, and extension of
interface between the 3GPP AAA server and HSS needs to be defined.
7) Protocol overhead: It depends on the specific protocol which is used to
carry EAP-AKA method.
8) Roaming: The MTC Server/Application Server communicates only with the 3GPP
AAA Server in the HPLMN, the 3GPP AAA Server would need to implement
functionality similar to that of a BSF.
## 5.3 External Interface Security
### 5.3.1 Issue Details
There are two scenarios of UEs communication with MTC server(s) illustrated in
TS 22.368 [9], MTC Server(s) controlled by the network operator or MTC
Server(s) not controlled by the operator. The interface between MTC Server and
CN may be over an insecure link. Communication between the MTC Server and the
CN for common and specific services (such as Device Triggering, MTC
Monitoring) are carried on this insecure link. Attack on the communication
between MTC Server and CN may cause false activities either to the MTC Server,
UE or to the 3GPP network or privacy sensitive information such as identities
may be eavesdropped, which may lead to serious problems.
### 5.3.2 Threats
For example the following threats are identified for external interface
security:
**_For Device Triggering:_**
The network triggers UEs to initiate communication with the MTC Server based
on a trigger indication sent from the MTC Server. This will open a chance for
an attacker, especially when the MTC server is outside the operator domain.
The attacker can impersonate the MTC server to send a false trigger indication
to the network, and then the network is utilized by the attacker to trigger
the corresponding UE(s) used for MTC. This will cause false decision on the UE
which may lead to the waste of the UE\'s power consumption and even a DOS
attack to the network, as a large number of UEs are triggered and required
authentication at the same time. Thus the attackers can manipulate this to
achieve their attack target.
An authorized MTC server may not have full control over a UE and thus certain
triggers from such MTC server to the UE might not be allowed. If such MTC
server inadvertently triggers the UE with incorrect trigger then it can cause
crucial damage to UE, for example UE triggered for software update by a MTC
server which is not authorized to do so.
The attacker can eavesdrop privacy sensitive information such as UE identities
on the external interface.
**_For MTC Monitoring:_**
In clause 7.2.8 of TR 22.368 [9] four monitoring events are defined:
\- Behaviour which is not aligned with activated MTC Feature(s)
\- Change in the point of attachment
\- Change of the association between the UE and the UICC
\- Loss of connectivity
Upon the detection of the above events, the network provides a warning
notification to the MTC Server. Then the MTC User will execute the appropriate
measure according to the detected event. If an attacker impersonates a network
to send a fake monitoring warning notification to the MTC Server, the MTC
Server can reject to provide service to the UE or it will cause wrong decision
such as initiating false triggering procedure.
**_Analysis of device identity privacy issues_**
The attacker can eavesdrop privacy sensitive information such as UE identities
on the external interface.
SA2 is discussing what device identifier that should be used between a MTC
Service Provider and the network, see e.g. SA2 TR 23.888 V1.1.0 [10], clause
6.38 (or the original agreed pCR in S2-111220), where two types of
identifiers, IMSI and a ISSI, are considered. Using these identifiers between
an external MTC Service Provider may introduce privacy issues.
Using IMSI for network external identification purposes should, as is noted in
S2-111220, of course as usual be avoided. Far reaching measures has for
example been taken to avoid exposing the IMSI over radio interfaces by
introducing temporary identifiers (TMSI, P-TMSI, S-TMSI, GUTI etc.).
The ISSI (International Service provider Subscription Identifier) is
introduced as an alternative having a number of desired features.
One particular security advantage of use of ISSI compared to IMSI is that it
would allow a network to easily check that a MTC Server is authorized to issue
a request towards a particular device as this is clear from the service
provider ID included in the identifier. Using IMSI the network would have to
rely on information about device and Service provider association stored in
the HSS. Note that the need to contact the HSS to get assurance that the
Service provider is authorized for contacting a UE could be used to implement
a DoS attack towards the Network/HSS. A prerequisite is of course that the
network configured for MTC can securely authenticate the MTC server issuing a
request.
Still, intercept of event reports or commands and responses sent over the
external interface may reveal security/privacy sensitive information; it all
depends on the information sent to or from the UE. But sometimes just
understanding that a UE reports something, an event is trapped by the network
or that a device is being triggered may have security/privacy consequences.
However, it is easy to stop such leakage of security/privacy sensitive
information by requiring that the communication between an external MTC
Service Provider and the Network is confidentiality protected. As pointed out
above it also has to be integrity protected so use of TLS or IPSec would solve
this issue.
### 5.3.3 Security requirements
Editor\'s Note: The administrative burden of maintaining such lists for
authorization information within the 3GPP needs further study.
When the MTC Server is located outside the 3GPP operator domain, the following
security requirements apply:
\- The 3GPP network and the MTC Server should be able to mutually authenticate
each other.
\- The network should explicitly reveal UE status, such as online/offline,
idle or connected to authorized parties only, e.g. to an authorized SCS in
relation to monitoring feature, cf. clause 5.11 Monitoring.
\- The 3GPP network should be able to determine whether the MTC server is
authorized to send control plane requests.
\- The 3GPP network should be able to determine that the MTC server is
authorized to send the given trigger to the given UE.
\- The signalling messages between the3GPP network and the MTC Server should
be integrity protected.
\- The signalling messages between the3GPP network and the MTC Server should
be confidentiality protected.
\- The level of security of the protection should not be lower than in the
case when the MTC server is within the operator domain.
\- Security measures are applied to MTC reference points when communication
extends beyond the boundary of the 3GPP system unless physical security is
available.
Ensure the privacy of the 3GPP user, in particular the 3GPP private user
identity (IMSI/IMPI)
The mobile network provides security mechanisms that can be used to (see TR
23.888 [10]):
\- ensure that an MTC Server can only communicate with certain UEs;
\- ensure that only authorized PDN entities can communicate with the UEs;
\- ensure that a UE can only communicate with the MTC Server(s) of its
subscriber, and that communication with any other entity is not possible.
MTC Security GW could be used between the MTC server and the core network as
the first point of entry into a secure operator network. The MTC Security GW
can be an independent node or co-located with an intermediate node (e.g. MTC
IWF).
Editor\'s Note: The above requirement needs to be revisited as the level of
security is not clear enough.
Editor\'s Note: The specific node in the 3GPP network side of the interface is
FFS.
Editor\'s Note: Requirement, \"It shall be possible to provide secure and
encrypted communication between PLMN and MTC Server\" is reported in TR 23.888
[10]. It is FFS to detail this requirement.
### 5.3.4 Solutions
#### 5.3.4.0 General
External interface is an interface that connects a network entity inside 3GPP
network with another entity outside the 3GPP network. Therefore, the interface
specified in MTC architecture in TS 23.682 [23] and need to be considered here
includes:
1) Tsp interface between MTC-IWF and SCS.
2) Gi/SGi interfaces between GGSN/P-GW and AS and between GGSN/P-GW and SCS.
3) Tsms interface between SMS-SC/GMSC/IWMSC and SME.
NOTE: SME covers the SMS functionality of SCS.
#### 5.3.4.1 Tsp interface security for MTC Server outside the operator domain
When the MTC Server is located outside the operator domain, the interface
between the core network and the MTC Server may be protected using mechanisms
like NDS/IP [2]. As the MTC server is located outside the operator domain it
may not be possible to mandate the use of NDS/IP but the exact protection
mechanism may be based on the agreements between the 3GPP network and MTC
server.
Functional entity MTC Security GW may be used to authentication and
authorization the MTC servers and to secure the external interfaces as shown
in the figure 5.3.4.1-1.
Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Tsp interface security for Service Capability Server outside
the operator domain
Thus the MTC Security GW within the MTC-IWF can perform access control
functionality of MTCsp interface to prevent the unauthorized MTC server from
accessing to the core network. It can authenticate with MTC server on behalf
of the 3GPP network.
After successful mutual authentication between the MTC server and the MTC
security GW, the MTC security GW connects the MTC server to the operator\'s
security domain. Any connection between the MTC server and the core network is
protected through the MTC security GW. End-to-end security protection should
be used for protection between the MTC server and the MTC security GW.
Security protection is required between the MTC security GW and the MTC server
placed outside the Operator\'s secure domain. Security protection should be
used for any communication between the entities. Communication between the MTC
server and the MTC security GW should be confidentiality, integrity and replay
protected. The NDS/IP security mechanism [2] or proprietary security mechanism
is used for mutual authentication and to protect the communication between the
MTC security GW and the MTC server.
Any unauthenticated traffic from the MTC server should be filtered out at the
MTC security GW.
For the MTC Security GW within the MTC-IWF, it can restrict the trigger
request coming from the unauthorized MTC Servers to prevent the unauthorized
MTC servers triggering the UE. When one MTC server needs to trigger a UE, it
sends trigger request information to the MTC Security GW, and the MTC server
identity and UE identity should be included in the request information or an
authenticated identity of its group membership. On receiving the trigger
request, MTC Security GW first verifies whether the MTC server is authorized
to send trigger requests based on pre-configured information. If the MTC
server is allowed to, the MTC Security GW further interrogates with HLR/HSS to
determine whether the MTC server is authorized to trigger a particular UE.
Based on the subscription of UE, HLR/HSS makes this decision and sends a
response to the MTC Security GW. If the response indicates the MTC server is
allowed to trigger the UE, the MTC Security GW deliver the SMS trigger message
as normal. If either check fails, the trigger request should be rejected.
#### 5.3.4.2 MTC Server inside the operator domain
When the MTC Server is located inside the operator domain, NDS/IP is mandatory
to implement and optional to use.
### 5.3.5 Void
## 5.4 Restricting the USIM to specific UEs
### 5.4.1 Issues Details
The issue that led to the need to restrict the USIM to specific MEs is
illustrated in a use case \"Access control with billing plan\" in Annex A of
TS 22.368 [9].
**Access Control with billing plan Use Case**
In some configurations, it may be necessary to restrict the access of a UICC
that is dedicated to be used only with machine type modules associated with a
specific billing plan. It should be possible to associate a list of UICC to a
list of terminal identity such as IMEISV so that if the UICC is used in
another terminal type, the access will be refused. See the following
configuration:
{width="4.7027777777777775in" height="3.873611111111111in"}
Figure 5.4.1-1: Access Control with billing plan
The restriction can be enforced by a one USIM to one UE binding or a one USIM
to many UE binding. It is the operator to enforce the restriction.
### 5.4.2 Threats
The following threat has been identified for this key issue:
\- An attacker moves a UICC to a different device in order to use a
subscription to get network access for himself, e.g. the attacker may try to
insert a UICC with low data rate subscription, dedicated to MTC MEs, into a
smartphone in order to download large files.
### 5.4.3 Security Requirements
In clause 7.1.1 of TS 22.368 [9] specifies the requirement to restrict the use
of a USIM to specific UEs.
### 5.4.4 Solutions
#### 5.4.4.0 General
Several mechanisms exist to address this issue.
Editor\'s Note: To consider the standard platform security robustness
requirements for securely storing the private key is FFS
#### 5.4.4.1 User Equipment-based pairings
##### 5.4.4.1.0 General
CT6 discussed and considered three User Equipment-based mechanisms to restrict
the use of UICC to specific MTC MEs, confer CT6 contribution C6-110182:
\- Secure Channel pairing
\- USAT application pairing
\- PIN verification pairing
##### 5.4.4.1.1 Secure Channel pairing
A secure channel pairing is successful when an Application-to-Application
\"Secured APDU\" secure channel is completed as described in ETSI TS 102 484
[36].
CT6 mechanism proposes the use of pre-shared key (PSK) to establish the secure
channel.
TS 102 484 [36] defines also a key agreement based on certificate exchange to
establish the key material for the Master SA of the Application-to-Application
\"Secured APDU\" secure channel, the key material results from a certificate-
based TLS handshake. This key agreement based on certificate exchange is used
in Rel-10 Relay Node security to define certificate-based secure channel
between the Relay Node and the UICC, as described in TS 33.401 [13].
Consequently, the use of a key agreement based on certificate exchange, as
described in ETSI TS 102 484 [36], is considered in this analysis as a
possible solution to restrict the USIM to specific UEs. To ease the reading of
this analysis, the Application-to-Application \"Secured APDU\" secure channel
with a pre-shared key is named PSK-based secure channel, and Application-to-
Application \"Secured APDU\" secure channel with key agreement based on
certificate exchanged is named certificate-based secure channel.
SA1 allows restricting the use of a USIM to one MTC ME or many MTC MEs.
\- In case of PSK-based secure channel, the same pre-shared key should be
provisioned in the USIM and in one or several authorized MTC MEs to allow the
use of a USIM to one MTC ME or a group of MTC MEs.
\- In case of certificate-based secure channel, it may be needed to reinforce
the one-to-one or one-to-multiple binding by means of MTC ME identity check if
the root certificate used to verify the MTC ME certificate is not dedicated to
the list of authorized MTC MEs for this USIM . In this case, the USIM stores
in a dedicated file (EF~IMEISV~) the list of authorized IMEI(SV) values or
IMEI(SV) ranges of values to which the USIM is bound. During certificate
verification the USIM checks that the IMEI(SV) received in MTC ME certificate
matches the value or the range of values the UICC is configured with. The file
of IMEI(SV) value or range of values to which the USIM is bound is described
in CT6 contribution for USAT application pairing, this file can be updated by
means of Over-The-Air mechanism.
The file EF~pairing~ stores the status of the last pairing check performed by
the UICC. The UICC checks the combination of USIM and MTC ME and sets the
status flag to \"OK\" in case of successful pairing check. The UICC also
stores in the file EF~pairing~ the IME(SV) value of the MTC ME. In case of
unsuccessful pairing check, the USIM sets the status flag to \"KO\" and stores
in the file EF~pairing~ the IME(SV) value of the unauthorized MTC ME.
The status flag of pairing check (with value \"OK or \"KO\") stored in the
file EF~pairing~ can be read by any terminal hosting the UICC. But, the
IMEI(SV) value stored in the file EF~pairing~ is protected by ADM right, only
the operator can retrieve this information. The information stored in the file
EF~pairing~ provide a mechanism to detect change of association between a USIM
and a MTC ME. The information stored in the file ~EFpairing~ can be read out
locally by the maintenance persons.
UICC OTA mechanism (as specified in 3GPP TS 31.115 [19] / TS 31.116 [20] and
ETSI TS 102 225 [17] and TS 102 226 [18]) is used to update the file EF
~IMEISV~ stored in the USIM. This mechanism provides dynamic management of the
pairing to change the allowed combinations of USIM and MTC ME(s) by adding or
removing authorized IMEI(SV) values or IMEI(SV) ranges the file EF ~IMEISV~.
The MTC ME stores a certificate where the subject name is the IMEI(SV) value.
This certificate is signed by operator or vendor. To verify the MTC ME
certificate, the UICC stores the associated root certificate corresponding to
the operator or vendor who signed the MTC ME certificates.
The provisioning of certificates and pre-shared key can be performed during
personalization phase of the MTC ME or the UICC. Provisioning during
personalization phase is out of scope.
For UICC into the field it is possible to change the pre-shared key or root
certificates stored in the UISM by means of UICC OTA as specified in 3GPP TS
31.115 [19] / TS 31.116 [20] and ETSI TS 102 225 [17] and TS 102 226 [18]. The
USIM could store several root certificates in the file dedicated to the
storage of root certificates used to verify the combination of USIM and MTC
ME.
For MTC ME into the field it is possible to modify the pre-shared key or
certificate stored in the MTC ME by means of OMA DM.
> Editor\'s Note: It is FFS Whether certificate is a vendor certificate or
> operator certificate.
##### 5.4.4.1.2 USAT application pairing
USAT application pairing is successful when the IMEI or IMEISV retrieved from
the terminal matches the value or the range of values the UICC is configured
with. USAT application pairing fails if the terminal does not support USAT
command PROVIDE LOCAL INFORMATION. After a UICC reset, the USIM shouldhave its
PIN in a blocked state before USIM application selection. The PIN is unblocked
and disabled after a successful USAT application pairing. An UE supporting
USAT application pairing should proceed to Profile download as specified in TS
31.111 [12]. The USIM should immediately send a proactive command PROVIDE
LOCAL INFORMATION requesting the UE\'s IMEI(SV). The UE should then send the
TERMINAL RESPONSE with its IMEI(SV) before starting USIM initialization
procedure.
The file [EF]{.underline}~IMEISV~ stores the IMEI(SV) or range of value to
which the USIM is bound.
The file EF~pairing~ stores the status of the last pairing check performed by
the UICC. The UICC checks the combination of USIM and MTC ME and sets the
status flag to \"OK\" in case of successful pairing check. The UICC also
stores in the file EF~pairing~ the IME(SV) value of the MTC ME. In case of
unsuccessful pairing check, the USIM sets the status flag to \"KO\" and stores
in the file EF~pairing~ the IME(SV) value of the unauthorized MTC ME.
The status flag of pairing check (with value \"OK or \"KO\") stored in the
file EF~pairing~ can be read by any terminal hosting the UICC. But, the
IMEI(SV) value stored in the file EF~pairing~ is protected by ADM right, only
the operator can retrieve this information. The information stored in the file
EF~pairing~ provide a mechanism to detect change of association between a USIM
and a MTC ME. The information stored in the file ~EFpairing~ can be read out
locally by the maintenance persons.
UICC OTA mechanism (as specified in 3GPP TS 31.115 [19] / TS 31.116 [20] and
ETSI TS 102 225 [17] and TS 102 226 [18]) is used to update the file EF
~IMEISV~ stored in the USIM. This mechanism provides dynamic management of the
pairing to change the allowed combinations of USIM and MTC ME(s) by adding or
removing authorized IMEI(SV) values or IMEI(SV) ranges the file EF ~IMEISV~.
##### 5.4.4.1.3 PIN presentation pairing
By having the PIN enabled and the UE provisioned with the PIN value, it is
possible to restrict the usage of the USIM to this UE and therefore prevent
unauthorized use of the USIM in another equipment. This mechanism can be used
in conjunction with the USAT application pairing as an additional measure.
The file EF~pairing~ stores the status of the last pairing check performed by
the UICC. The UICC checks the combination of USIM and MTC ME and sets the
status flag to \"OK\" in case of successful pairing check. In case of
unsuccessful pairing check, the USIM sets the status flag to \"KO\".
The status flag of pairing check (with value \"OK or \"KO\") stored in the
file EF~pairing~ can be read by any terminal hosting the UICC. The information
stored in the file EF~pairing~ provide a mechanism to detect change of
association between a USIM and a MTC ME. The information stored in the file
~EFpairing~ can be read out locally by the maintenance persons.
The PIN value in the USIM could be change by UICC OTA mechanism. All specific
MTC MEs authorized to be used with this USIM should be updated with the new
PIN value, e.g. by means of OMA DM.
#### 5.4.4.2 Network based pairings
##### 5.4.4.2.1 IMSI-IMEI binding in HSS
##### 5.4.4.2.1.1 General {#general-7 .H6}
In order to secure that only authorized combinations of USIMs and MEs are
used, the HSS holds a list of authorized combinations of IMEI(SV)s per IMSI.
If an authorized IMSI/IMEI combination is detected by the HSS, the HSS should
accept the registration from the UE. If an unauthorized IMSI/IMEI combination
is detected by the HSS, the operator should be notified and should then be
able to take any further appropriate action, e.g. automatically denying access
to the network by rejecting the Location Update procedure.
##### 5.4.4.2.1.2 Restrict the use of a USIM to specific ME(s) {#restrict-the-
use-of-a-usim-to-specific-mes .H6}
As an optional function to secure that only authorized ME\'s are used with a
subscription (see clause 7.1.1 in 3GPP TS 22.368 [9] for corresponding stage 1
requirement), [ ]{.underline} the HSS may hold a list of authorized
IMEI(SV)\'s per IMSI. During EMM/GMM/MM procedures the SGSN, MME or MSC
indicates any new IMSI/IMEI(SV) pair to the HSS as described in TS 23.060 [3],
TS 23.401 [4] and TS 23.012 [24]. For IMSI with a list of authenticated
IMEI(SV) if the HSS detects an IMEI(SV) not in the authorized list then the
HSS informs the MME, SGSN or MSC and the EMM/GMM/MM procedure is rejected.
NOTE: The function relies upon the Automatic Device Detection mechanism as
specified in TS 23.060 [3] being supported in the MSC and SGSN for them to
identify a new IMSI and IMEI combination and provide also the IMEI to the HSS.
If the UE roams into a visited network which does not support the Automatic
Device Detection mechanism in the SGSN or MSC, as specified in TS 23.060 [3]
and TS 23.012 [24], then it is a home operator choice whether to accept or
reject the UE.
##### 5.4.4.2.1.3 Procedure {#procedure .H6}
Figure 5.4.4.2.1.3-1 shows how the HSS can check if the IMSI/IMEI pair is
authorized.
In GERAN/UTRAN, the ADD (Automatic Device Detection) feature is optional to
support in SGSN/MSC. If this feature is supported and enabled in the SGSN/MSC,
the SGSN/MSC requests the IMEI(SV) from the UE and provide the IMSI-IMEI(SV)
pair to the HSS when the SGSN/MSC has detected that the IMEI(SV) has changed
in the SGSN/MSC or the IMEI(SV) is new for the IMSI.
In LTE, the ADD feature is mandatory to support in the MME. When this feature
is enabled in the MME, the MME requests the IMEI(SV) from the UE and provide
the IMSI-IMEI(SV) pair to the HSS when the MME has detected that the IMEI(SV)
has changed in the MME or the IMEI(SV) is new for the IMSI.
This solution requires the ADD feature to be supported and enabled in
SGSN/MME/MSC. Additionally the HSS/HLR needs to verify if an IMSI/IMEI pair is
allowed.
Using ADD for requesting IMEI(SV) from the UE is commonly used in networks
today to detect when a user has purchased a new UE so that e.g. appropriate
MMS and internet access settings can be sent to user\'s new UE.
Using this legacy feature also enables the HSS/HLR in the home network to
check if the IMSI-IMEI(SV) pair received from the SGSN/MME/MSC is authorized.
If there is a need to change authorized combinations of IMSI/IMEI (e.g. due to
billing plan change), only the HSS/HLR needs to be updated, There is no need
to update other entities.
It should be noted that the list of authorized IMEI(SV)/IMSI pairs can be
stored and the checking can also be performed in another node than HSS/HLR,
e.g. a server connected to the HSS/HLR, It is however believed that HSS/HLR is
the natural place to do the checking.
Figure 5.4.4.2.1.3-1: Solution for IMSI/IMEI in HSS
The following is a description of the steps in figure 5.4.4.2.1.3-1.
Step 1: The authorized IMEI(SV) lists per IMSI are pre-configured in the
HSS/HLR
Step 2: ADD function is supported and enabled in MME/SGSN/MSC.
Step 3: This is the normal Attach procedure as described in TS 24.008 [34] and
TS 24.301 [35].
Step 4: This is the normal UMTS/EPS AKA procedure as described in TS 24.008
[34] and TS 24.301 [35].
\- In PS GERAN/PS UTRAN only: the IMEI request from the network can take place
in this procedure.
\- In PS UTRAN, the security may not be enabled when AKA procedure is
initiated, and the network can also request the IMEI from the UE after
integrity protection and encryption has been enabled e.g. in step 6.
\- In PS GERAN, integrity protection is not supported, and encryption may not
be enabled when AKA procedure is initiated. The network can request the IMEI
from the UE after encryption is enabled e.g. in step 6.
Step 5: In LTE only: This is the normal NAS Security Mode Command procedure as
described in TS 24.301 [35]. The IMEI request/response can take place in this
procedure in an integrity protected way.
Step 6: In GERAN/UTRAN/LTE: This is the normal Identification procedure where
the IMEI request/response can take place as described in TS 24.008 [34] and TS
24.301 [35].
In LTE: according to TS 33.401 [13] the UE provides its IMEI(SV) to the
network if the network asks for it in an integrity protected request.
According TS 33.401 [13] the IMEI(SV) should be encrypted.
In UTRAN: The network can request the IMEI(SV) from the UE in this procedure
once the integrity protection and encryption is enabled.
In GERAN integrity protection is not supported. The GERAN network can request
the IMEI(SV) from the UE in this procedure once the encryption is enabled.
Step 7. This is the normal Update Location procedure as described in TS 23.012
[24]. The SGSN/MME/MSC includes the IMEI(SV) and IMSI in the Update Location
message to the HSS/HLR.
Step 8: The HSS/HLR checks whether the IMSI/IMEI(SV) pair is authorized
according to the preconfigured lists. If the pair is not authorized in the
HSS/HLR, the network operator is notified and may then take any appropriate
action, e.g. the HSS/HLR may reject the Location Update procedure.
##### 5.4.4.2.2 Enhanced AKA authentication
##### 5.4.4.2.2.1 General {#general-8 .H6}
Two network based solution variants for restricting the USIM to certain UEs
are provided. The variants are similar and only differ in how the network
decides that the key used to authenticate the device is the correct one. Both
solutions are based on enhancing the AKA procedure that runs between the UE
and core network (see subclause 5.4.4.2.2.2) and use the same basic flows for
initial attach and re-authentication (see subclause 5.4.4.2.2.3). Both
solution variants also rely on the HSS/HLR checking that an IMSI/IMEI pair is
authorized to attach to the network. The difference between the two solution
variants are provided in subclause 5.4.4.2.2.4).
##### 5.4.4.2.2.2 Enhanced AKA authentication Procedure {#enhanced-aka-
authentication-procedure .H6}
The existing AKA authentication procedure is enhanced to also perform device
authentication that works in conjunction with the standard AKA authentication.
Providing device authentication requires that the device has been provisioned
with a _device_root_key_ that can be used to send encrypted traffic to the
device and that is uniquely associated to the IMEI of the device. The
_device_root_key_ is a public key of the device. A secure part of the device
stores the sensitive device keys such as the private key and performs all
cryptographic operations that make use of these sensitive keys.
The device authentication can be run either in parallel with the AKA
procedures by adding new IEs to the AKA messages or can run separately by
enhancing other NAS or in a new message (which is preferred is a stage 3
decision). The latter case allows the IMEI to be sent only after the security
has been established and helps preserve the privacy of the IMEI.
Whenever a Core Network Node (CNN), e.g. SGSN in UTRAN/GERAN or MME in
E-UTRAN, wishes to perform device authentication, it creates a
_device_challenge_ and sends it to the device in a relevant NAS message. The
device computes the _device_response_ and returns it to the network in a
response NAS message. This allows the CNN to authenticate the device.
In addition, a root key, K~Device~, for a particular access, e.g. a key that
takes on the role of CK and IK in UTRAN or K~ASME~ in E-UTRAN, can be
calculated from the device authentication. The calculation of K~Device~
includes using K~Root~, the root key calculated from the concurrent AKA run or
previous AKA run, if there is one, and hence K~Device~ is derived based on
keys resulting from both the normal AKA run and the device authentication.
The calculation of _device_challenge_ , _device_response_ and _K~Device~_ are
as follows:
> _device_challenge_ = _E~device_root_key~ (device_temp_key)_ ,
> _network_nonce_
where _E~K~(data)_ means _data_ encrypted with key _K_ , and _network_nonce_
is a 128-bit random number chosen by the network. The _device_temp_key_ is a
256-bit random number chosen by the network.
Both the UE and CNN keep _device_temp_key_ while it has the security context
that has a _K~Device~_ that was derived from it. This means that
_E~device_root_key~ (device_temp_key)_ is optional to send in the case that
the CNN knows the current security context being used by the UE has a
_K~Device~_ as root key and hence the UE has a _device_temp_key_ stored and
the CNN is willing to re-use that key.
_device_response_ is calculated as
> _device_response_ = _device_nonce_ , _device_res_
where _device_nonce_ is a 128-bit random number (e.g. 128 bits) chosen by the
device; and _device_res_ is a 128-bit number that is calculated as follows:
> _device_res_ = KDF (_device_temp_key_ , _network_nonce_ \|\| _device_nonce_)
where KDF is a suitable pseudo-random function _._
Finally, the calculation of _K~Device~_ is as follows:
> _K~Device~_ = KDF (_device_temp_key_ \|\|_K~Root~_ , _network nonce_ \|\|
> _device_nonce_)
where _K~Root~_ is the key(s) freshly generated from a standard AKA
authentication or the key(s) previously generated before the CNN initiates the
device authentication.
A security context that has been created using enhanced AKA be kept in the ME
and not stored on the UICC.
##### 5.4.4.2.2.3 High-Level flows for the proposed method {#high-level-flows-
for-the-proposed-method .H6}
##### 5.4.4.2.2.3.1 General {#general-9 .H6}
The following subclauses contain attachment and re-authentication flows for
the method at a high-level. The flows do not illustrate actual message but
rather logical steps (except the device authentication step in each flow). The
flows apply to both the proposed solution variants and are common for the
different access networks (i.e. GERAN, UTRAN and E-UTRAN). The details of
steps 2 and 3 of the attachment flow are provided in subclause 5.4.4.2.2.4 for
each of the proposed solutions.
##### 5.4.4.2.2.3.2 Attachment flow {#attachment-flow .H6}
Figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.2-1 shows how an UE can attach to a network with the
addition of a device authentication step. The flow represents the most general
case of attachment where the network holds no useful information about the UE
from any previous connections.
{width="6.502083333333333in" height="3.390972222222222in"}
Figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.2-1: Attachment flow
The following is a description of the steps in figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.2-1.
Step 1: This is the normal messages for the access network except that the CNN
informs the HSS/HLR that it is capable of performing device authentication for
the UE and the HSS/HLR informs the CNN that device authentication is needed.
Note 1: The HSS/HLR could hold the latest requested IMEI for each IMSI and
provide this in Step 1. For second or subsequent attachments of a
subscription, the HSS/CNN provides the CNN with the IMEI and challenge data.
This would remove the need for step 3 in these cases. Whether the optimization
is necessary is FFS.
Steps 2: This step is solution dependent but only requires a change from
standard behaviour in the case of solution that requires a device certificate
from the UE. It should also be noted that for some access network, the IMEI
request/response may happen in the same messages that are used for step 1.
Step 3: This step is solution variant specific; however in all variants, the
CNN gets the HSS to check the whether the current IMSI/IMEI pair is authorized
to access the network and also fetches any required device authentication data
from the HSS.
Note 2: For variant 1, steps 3 and 4 can be performed in either order or
simultaneously.
Step 4a: The CNN sends the device challenge to the UE. The _(e)KSI_ , the
normal key identifier, is sent by the CNN to indicate it wants the UE to
create a security context with _K~Device~_ as its root key. The
_device_challenge_ always contain _network_nonce_ but only contains
_E~device_root_key~ (device_temp_key)_ if the CNN wants to change
_device_temp_key_ as described in subclause 5.4.4.2.2.2.
Step 4b: As _(e)KSI_ was included in step 4a, the UE establishes a security
context with _K~Device~_ as its root key
Step 4c: The UE responds to the CNN with _device_response_ that contains both
_device_nonce_ and _device_res_ (see subclause 5.4.4.2.2.2).
Step 4d: The CNN checks _device_res_ is the expected value and establish a new
security context if step 4a included _(e)KSI_.
Step 5: The CNN should take any new security context into use before any user
plane data is carried over the network. The attach procedure is completed.
##### 5.4.4.2.2.3.3 Re-authentication flow {#re-authentication-flow .H6}
Figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.3-1 shows how to re-authenticate with device
authentication.
{width="6.502777777777778in" height="3.279861111111111in"}
Figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.3-1: Re-authentication flow
The following is a description of the steps in figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.3-1.
Step 1: The CNN retrieves any needed authentication information from the
HSS/HLR, e.g. an AKA authentication vector.
Steps 2a to 2d: The same as steps 4a to 4d in subclause 5.4.4.2.2.3.2.
Step 3: The CNN should take the new security context into use before any user
plane data is carried over the network.

{#context-transfer-at-handover-idle-mobility-and-attach .H6}
Figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.4-1 shows the changes required to the legacy procedures
between CN that transfer the UE\'s context at handover, idle mobility and
attach when enhanced AKA is used. The difference is that if the context that
is sent by the old CNN is one for a UE that requires enhanced AKA, then the
old CNN includes some additional fields in the context transfer.

Figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.4-1: Context transfer between CNNs
The following is a description of the steps in figure 5.4.4.2.2.3.4-1.
Step 1: If the context passed in a message to transfer context between CNNs is
for a UE that requires enhanced AKA, then the old CNN passes the new CNN the
following information; an indication that the UE requires enhanced AKA, IMEI
and Device public key. In addition if the old CNN passes a UE security
context, it should also pass an indication that the security context is a
device based one and the _device_temp_key._
##### 5.4.4.2.2.4 Differences between the solution variants {#differences-
between-the-solution-variants .H6}
##### 5.4.4.2.2.4.1 General {#general-10 .H6}
The following subclauses describe the different solution and in particular
step 2 and 3 in those different solutions.
##### 5.4.4.2.2.4.2 Variant 1: HSS/HLR provides the root certificate
{#variant-1-hsshlr-provides-the-root-certificate .H6}
In this solution, the HSS/HLR needs to be provisioned (or have access to a
database) with the IMSI/IMEI pairs that are authorized for use and the
associated root certificate that has been used to sign the UE\'s certificate.
The following describes steps 2 and 3 for this solution.
Step 2: The CNN requests and receives the UE\'s certificate from the UE.
Step 3: The CNN sends IMSI and IMEI pair of the UE to the HSS/ HLR and also
requests the root certificate related to that IMEI. Note that the request for
root certificate can be skipped if the CNN has a local copy of the root
certificate associated with the received IMEI. The HSS/HLR checks that
IMSI/IMEI pair is authorized to attach to the network and if so returns
authorization success and the root certificate to the CNN (if requested by the
CNN). The CNN uses the root certificate to check the UE\'s certificate is
valid and hence gets the public key of the UE from the UE\'s certificate and
is able to perform device authentication of the UE.
A particular IMSI/IMEI pair is revoked by removing it from the HSS or
associated database. A particular device is revoked by removing all the
IMSI/IMEI pairs that relate to that device.
##### 5.4.4.2.2.4.3 Variant 2: HSS/HLR provides the UE\'s public key
{#variant-2-hsshlr-provides-the-ues-public-key .H6}
In this solution, the HSS/HLR needs to be provisioned (or have access to a
database) with the IMSI/IMEI pairs that are authorized for use and the public
key of the UE. The following describes steps 2 and 3 for this solution.
Step 2: There is no change from the current standard behaviour.
Step 3: The CNN sends IMSI and IMEI pair to the HSS/ HLR and also requests the
public key related to that IMEI from the HSS/HLR. The HSS/HLR checks that
IMSI/IMEI pair is authorized and if so returns the public key associated with
the IMEI to the CNN. The CNN uses the received public key to perform device
authentication of the UE.
A particular IMSI/IMEI pair is revoked by removing it from the HSS or
associated database. A particular device is revoked by removing all the
IMSI/IMEI pairs that relate to that device.
##### 5.4.4.2.3 Pairing based on symmetric shared secret
##### 5.4.4.2.3.1 General {#general-11 .H6}
IMEI(SV) validation leverages a symmetric common secret, K~ME~, between the UE
and the 3GPP HSS. K~ME~ is used by the HSS for encrypting the RAND value that
is sent to the UE during the AKA protocol. In particular, the RAND value that
is included in each Authentication Vector, sent by the HSS to MME/SGSN, is
encrypted using K~ME~ as the cipher key. Only the MEs that have the proper
K~ME~ are able to decrypt the original value of the RAND before submitting it
to the UICC. If ME manages to successfully decrypt RAND using K~ME~, then the
properly decrypted value will be provided to UICC and will be used for
generating the RES value. Otherwise, AKA will fail. Specifically, if ME is not
in possession of the K~ME~ that was used by the 3GPP network to encrypt RAND,
ME will not be able to decrypt and obtain the value of RAND and therefore,
UICC will not be able to compute the correct value of RES or other security
context parameters.
When the HSS subscription record indicates that the IMSI is restricted to one
specific device, then it is sufficient to provision one shared secret in the
HSS and this device. When subscription is restricted to multiple devices,
multiple shared secrets -- one per device\'s IMEI(SV) \-- need to be
provisioned in the HSS, and a particular secret is selected based on the
knowledge of the IMEI(SV) reported by the UE.
##### 5.4.4.2.3.2 Procedure {#procedure-1 .H6}
The steps of the verification process are depicted in figure 5.4.4.2.3.2-1
below, and are explained in what follows. It is assumed that HSS has been
provisioned (or has access to a database) with the IMSI/IMEI pairs that are
authorized for use. For all authorized IMEI values (and thereby authorized
devices), HSS has associated the same K~ME~ key, which has been pre-
provisioned into each authorized device (ME with corresponding IMEI).
Figure 5.4.4.2.3.2-1: Binding using a shared secret between HSS and UE.
**_0\. Optional step:_** ME reports the IMEI value to the 3GPP network (as per
clause 5.4.4.2.1).
1\. When generating the Authentication Vector(s) associated with a specific
IMSI, HSS uses the IMEI-IMSI association as an indicator of which K~ME~ to use
for encrypting the RAND parameter that is included in each AV.
2\. The AV with encrypted RAND is sent to the Serving System.
3\. The MME/SGSN sends the (encrypted) RAND and AUTN parameters to the UE.
4\. ME uses the pre-provisioned K~ME~ to decrypt the received encrypted value
of RAND.
5\. Once the RAND is decrypted, the ME forwards the (decrypted) RAND and AUTN
to UICC.
6\. UICC uses the received RAND value to calculate RES.
7\. UICC returns the RES to the ME.
8\. UE further sends the computed RES to MME/SGSN.
9\. MME/SGSN compares the RES to the XRES (included in the AV sent by HSS), in
order to authenticate the UE. If authentication is successful, then the IMSI-
IMEI binding has been verified. If authentication is unsuccessful, then either
UICC is not valid, or UICC has been installed into an unauthorised device. In
either case, service will not be granted.
The K~ME~ key needs to be securely stored in the ME and in the HSS.
Editor\'s Note: Impact to HSS need further analysis.
##### 5.4.4.2.3.3 Examples of KME Establishment Procedure {#examples-of-kme-
establishment-procedure .H6}
Provisioning of the same K~ME~ into the UE and into HSS is use-case dependent.
For example, K~ME~ can be provisioned into the device by the manufacturer and
then provisioned into the HSS using offline methods. As another example, K~ME~
can be provisioned into the device and into the HSS by the 3GPP operator.
Alternatively, K~ME~ can be provisioned into the device and provided to the
3GPP operator by an affiliated third party. Depending on the business model,
these use cases may be applicable in scenarios when operator is known and/or
not known at manufacturing time. There are cases such that K~ME~ needs to be
updated (e.g. device is sold or operator changes).
Typically, the exact details of K~ME~ provisioning into device and into the
HSS are outside the scope of 3GPP. However, for the business model where the
K~ME~ is established or updated by the 3GPP operator (e.g. device is sold or
operator changes), the provisioning procedure may be specified to ensure
interoperability. The following examples describe K~ME~ provisioning
procedures for different use cases.
##### 5.4.4.2.3.3.1 K~ME~ Generated and Provisioned by the HSS, and shared
with the CNN {#kme-generated-and-provisioned-by-the-hss-and-shared-with-the-
cnn .H6}
This procedure describes the case of a core network that has been enhanced to
support the device binding function to load a new K~ME~ into a device.
The key highlights of this procedure:
\- It does not require state in the HSS during the procedure of loading a
(new) K~ME~:
\- It separates the device authentication and loading of K~ME~ from the
Location update procedure. This means that if there are other use cases that
require Device authentication or loading of a K~ME~ then the procedures are
more likely to apply without modification, e.g. no need to separate from
Location update procedure. Similarly the Device authentication could be run at
any time as it becomes a standalone procedure.
\- It is aligned with the flow in clause 5.4.4.2.1.3 for the simpler network
binding in that everything is complete at serving core network once it sends
the Location update complete and it only require the HSS to check the
IMSI/IMEI binding here to complete the attach procedure.
This procedure follows the basic principles listed below:
\- The HSS send K~ME~ to the serving core network:
\- The serving core network node (CNN) is responsible for generating the Nonce
that is used to challenge the UE and checking the response.
\- If the authentication of the UE is successful, then the serving network
node sends the K~ME~ back to the HSS/HLR along with the IMSI and IMEI in the
Update Location message.
\- The re-authentication procedure provides the UE with confirmation that the
new established KME is properly stored in the HSS/HLR and should now be used.
The following figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.1-1 shows the message flows:
{width="6.11875in" height="4.679166666666666in"}
Figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.1-1: K~ME~ Provisioned by the HSS with assistance of the
CNN
The following only includes the changes to the legacy procedures.
0\. The HSS/HLR has been pre-provisioned with a list of allowable IMSI/IMEI
pairs and the public key associated with the IMEIs are available to the
HSS/HLR.
1\. The UE performs the normal attach procedure. It includes the K~ME~_Check
parameter which is formed by hashing its stored K~ME~ and the subscription
identity included in this message.
2\. The CNN and UE complete an authentication, establishment of security. The
core network node also request and receives the IMEI from the UE. As part of
the process of authenticating the UE, when the CNN requests AVs, it passes the
K~ME~_Check parameter and the identity received in step 1 to the HSS. The HSS
can check that it has the same K~ME~ stored as the UE by calculating its own
version of K~ME~_Check and comparing it with the received value. If these
values are different the HSS/HLR indicates to the CNN that it need to
provision a new K~ME.~
3\. The core network node requests an encrypted K~ME~ and AV from the HSS/HLR.
It does this by sending the IMEI and IMSI to the HSS/HLR in the K_ME Request
transaction.
4\. The HSS/HLR generate a new K~ME~ and encrypts it with the public key of
the received IMEI. The HSS/HLR sends both the encrypted K~ME~ and the K~ME~ to
the core network node. The HSS/HLR also returns the AV bound to the new K~ME~.
5\. The CNN generates a Nonce to challenge the UE.
6\. The CNN sends the encrypted K~ME~ and Nonce to the UE.
7\. The UE decrypts K~ME~ and calculates the ME_Rsp from KME and Nonce. The UE
uses the newly received K~ME~ instead of any previously held K~ME.~ The UE
keeps the previous K~ME~ and reverts to it if there is no successful
authentication with an AV bound to the new K~ME~ before the UE goes into idle.
8\. The UE sends the ME_Rsp back to the CNN.
9\. The CNN checks the ME_Rsp is correct
10\. The CNN re-authenticates the UE with the AV bound to the new K~ME~ which
it received from the HSS/HLR in step 4. After a successful authentication
bound to the new K~ME~, the UE takes the new K~ME~ as the permanent K~ME~
associated with the USIM in use, and deletes any previous K~ME~.
Note: It is possible to combine the above step with messages 6 and 8. It is
left to the stage 3 group to decide which is the best way.
11\. The CNN takes the new security context into use by running the
appropriate security procedures if necessary.
12\. The CNN sends the location update including the new KME to the HSS/HLR.
13\. The HSS/HLR stores the KME with the IMSI if the IMSI/IMEI pair is
allowed. . The HSS/HLR then keeps this K~ME~ for the IMEI/IMSI pair.
##### 5.4.4.2.3.3.2 K~ME~ Generated and Provisioned by the HSS, and not shared
with the CNN {#kme-generated-and-provisioned-by-the-hss-and-not-shared-with-
the-cnn .H6}
In this variation of the procedure, as in the clause 5.4.4.2.3.3.1, the core
network that has been enhanced to support the device binding function to load
a new K~ME~ into a device. However, it differs from the procedure in clause
5.4.4.2.3.3.1 in a way that the CNN does not know the provisioned K~ME~.
As in clause 5.4.4.2.3.3.2, the key highlights of this procedure:
\- It does not require state in the HSS during the procedure of loading a
(new) K~ME~
\- It separates the device authentication and loading of K~ME~ from the
Location update procedure.
\- It is aligned with the flow in clause 5.4.4.2.1.3 for the simpler network
binding in that everything is complete at serving core network once it sends
the Location update complete and it only require the HSS to check the
IMSI/IMEI binding here to complete the attach procedure.
This procedure follows the basic principles listed below:
\- The HSS sends the K~ME~ and a random Nonce, encrypted by the UE\'s Public
Key, to the UE through the serving core network. The Nonce is used to
challenge the UE for the response, Rsp, that is later checked.
\- It order to avoid retaining the K~ME~ by the HSS until the completion of
provisioning, the HSS also sends the \"Cookie\" that represents the privately
encrypted value of the K~ME~. Only the HSS knows the encryption/decryption key
for this cookie.
\- In addition, the HSS sends to the CNN the expected hash response from the
UE, XRes.
\- The serving core network node (CNN) simply forwards the encrypted payload
to the UE, and keeps the Cookie and XRsp.
\- Once the UE decrypted the K~ME~, and generated the Rsp, the CNN is
responsible for checking this response.
\- To assure the HSS that the UE indeed properly decrypted the K~ME~, the UE
may optionally also generate a digital signature of the K~ME~ and return it to
the CNN.
\- If validation of the Rsp in the CNN is successful, the serving network node
sends the DSA of K~ME~ as well as the Cookie back to the HSS/HLR along with
the IMSI and IMEI in the Update Location message.
\- The HSS decrypts the Cookie obtaining the K~ME~, optionally validates
received digital signature of the K~ME~, and stores the K~ME~ in the
subscription database.
The following figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.2-1 shows the message flows:
Figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.2-1: K~ME~ Provisioned by the HSS, and not shared the CNN
0\. The HSS/HLR has been pre-provisioned with a list of allowable IMSI/IMEI
pairs and has an access to the public key associated with each IMEI.
1\. The UE performs the normal attach procedure.
2\. The CNN and UE complete an authentication, establishment of security. The
core network node also request and receives the IMEI from the UE.
a) The HSS realizes that the IMSI/IMEI Binding is required, but K~ME~ is not
yet provisioned. The HSS indicates to the CNN that Provisioning of the K~ME~
is expected.
3\. The CNN request an encrypted K~ME~ from the HSS/HLR. It does this by
sending the HSS/HLR the IMEI.
4\. The HSS/HLR generates a new K~ME~ and encrypts it with the public key
(PubK) of the received IMEI. The HSS also encrypts the K~ME~ with the local
block encryptor producing the Cookie. The encryption key for producing the
Cookie is kept in the HSS, and not shared with any entity. It is only needed
for decrypting the Cookie again when received back from the CNN. The HSS
generates the random Nonce, and hashes it with K~ME~ producing expected
response XRsp.
5\. The HSS sends the encrypted (K~ME~, Nonce)~PubK~, Cookie, and XRsp to the
CNN.
6\. The CNN forwards the (K~ME~, Nonce)~PubK~ the UE.
7\. The UE decrypts the K~ME~ using its Private Key (PrK). The UE hashes the
K~ME~ and Nonce to produce the Rsp. The UE also uses it Private Key (PrK) to
generate the DSA of K~ME~. The reason for this is explained in Step 11.
8\. The UE returns the Rsp and DSA(K~ME~) to the CNN.
9\. The CNN compares the Rsp with XRsp, and if match, proceeds to Step 10.
10\. The CNN generates the Location Update Request towards the HSS, including
the IMSI, IMEI, the Cookie, and the DSA(K~ME~).
11\. The HSS uses its internal secret to decrypt the Cookie and obtain the
K~ME~. The HSS then use the Public Key associated with the IMEI to verify the
DSA of K~ME~. If verification is successful, the HSS gets assured that the
Cookie was not substituted by unscrupulous CNN and the K~ME~ was properly
decrypted and accepted by the legitimate ME. The HSS stores the K~ME~ in
association with the IMEI if the IMSI/IMEI pair is allowed.
##### 5.4.4.2.3.3.3 K~ME~ Generated by the ME {#kme-generated-by-the-me .H6}
As in clause 5.4.4.2.3.3.1, the device has been provisioned at manufacture
with a pair of Private Key and associated Public Key that are uniquely
associated with the IMEI of the device. The Private Key is stored in the
device secure area, while the Public Key is deposited into a common database
accessible to Network Operators, or their provisioning systems.
In addition, the device is provisioned at manufacture with the manufacturer-
specific Modulus N which represents the product of two large prime numbers P
and Q (N=PQ). Requirements for selection of prime factors P and Q are as
defined in ANSI X9.31 [42] for RSA algorithm. The Primes P and Q are secret,
and known to the HSS as associated with specific manufacturer. Manufacturer
may choose to vary the P, Q, and N on a per-manufacturing lot basis, or other
criteria. But knowing the IMEI, the HSS should be able to obtain required P
and Q.
When the newly subscribed UE accesses the network, and the HSS determines that
it does not have the binding information for the subscription, or if the HSS
needs to find out the IMEI of the device used by the subscription (IMSI), the
HSS may decide to invoke the provisioning procedure to establish the K~ME~ in
the device.
In order to conduct provisioning procedure, the HSS will allow authenticated
access without using the device binding. For that the HSS issues the regular,
un-processed AV (RAND not encrypted) because the binding association has not
yet been established. The AV is indicated as regular (See clause 5.4.4.2.3.4)
using Binding Feature Control. By using conventional LTE capabilities, the HSS
requests and receives the device IMEI.
HSS indicates to the MME that the access is authorized only and exclusively
for the special purpose of provisioning binding credentials. Therefore any
bearer establishment is disallowed.
The air interface and NAS security can be invoked at this point, so all
subsequent interactions with the UE will be protected.
The ME-based provisioning functionality does the following:
\- the ME generates a random K~ME~;
\- by using the provisioned Private Key, the ME generates the Digital
Signature of the K~ME,~ the K~ME~_SIG, as specified in FIPS-186-3 [41];
\- the ME generates a random nonce R~ME~;
\- the ME concatenates (K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~) and encrypts it using the RSA
algorithm:
{K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~}\' = {K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~}\^_e_ mod _N_ ,
where _e_ is a predetermined Public Exponent, e.g. 2^16^, and _N_ is specific
for the device manufacturer.
\- In addition, the ME pre-computes the expected signature of the network, the
xNW_SIG, as a hash of K~ME~ and R~ME~.
xNW_SIG = SHA256(K~ME~\|R~ME~)
The encrypted {K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~}\' is returned to the MME, which
delivers it to the HSS along with the IMEI of the device.
The HSS decrypts the received {K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~}\' using the P and Q
associated with the manufacturer of the device. The HSS then retrieves the
Public Key associated with the IMEI of the device. Security of this retrieval
is outside the scope of 3GPP, but it is expected that only legitimate MNO can
request and receive the Public Key associated with the device. The HSS then
validates the K~ME~_SIG, and if valid -- accepts the K~ME~.
To prove to the ME that the HSS properly decrypted the K~ME~, the HSS
generates the NW_SIG:
NW_SIG = SHA256(K~ME~\|R~ME~)
The computed NW_SIG is returned to the ME which compares it to the pre-
computed xNW_SIG. If validation succeeds the K~ME~ is activated in the ME, and
is populated into the HSS subscription database and can now be used for
pre‑processing authentication vectors.
During the next network access the HSS will expect the device to use the
binding feature, and will generate a pre‑processed AV.
The general process of K~ME~ establishment is shown on figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.3-1.
Figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.3-1: K~ME~ Establishment - General Process
The message flow for K~ME~ establishment is shown on figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.3-2.
Figure 5.4.4.2.3.3.3-2: K~ME~ Establishment - Message Flow
1\. UE accesses the network for service. UICC with IMSI is installed in the
ME. The K~ME~ is not provisioned, or is unknown to the Home Operator.
2\. MME/SGSN/MSC requests the Authentication Vector to authenticate the IMSI
of the UE.
3\. HSS determines that reported IMSI needs to be bound to the device, but the
Binding Credential (K~ME~) is not yet established. In addition, the HSS needs
to obtain the IMEI of the ME currently used by the subscription.
4\. HSS issues the regular, un-processed Authentication Vector. The AKA
Authentication procedure is initiated. The UE recognizes that the received
Authentication Challenge is un-processed, and forwards it to the UICC. AKA
Authentication is concluded with un-processed AV. In PS GERAN and PS UTRAN the
SGSN/MSC can also request and receive the IMEI of the ME in this transaction.
Note 1: HSS should indicate to the MME that the access is authorized only and
exclusively for the special purpose of provisioning binding credentials.
Therefore any bearer establishment is disallowed.
Note 2: The MME indicates to the ME that the provisioning of the K~ME~ is
initiated.
As in clause 5.4.4.2.3.3.1, the IMEI is obtained from the ME
5\. The ME generates random K~ME~, computes digital signature K~ME~_SIG using
device-specific Private Key, generates a random nonce R~ME~, and encrypts the
(K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~) using RSA encryption with manufacturer-specific
Modulus N.
6\. The ME sends the NAS message to the MME containing the IMSI, IMEI, and
encrypted (K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~)). Specific suitable NAS transaction can be
selected by CT1.
7\. The MME initiates the S6a transaction defined for establishment of binding
credentials. In this message the MME sends the IMSI, IMEI, and encrypted
(K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~) in the new AVP to the HSS.
8\. The HSS obtains the Public Key for the ME from a database associated with
the received IMEI.
9\. HSS obtains the P & Q factors of N associated with device manufacturer,
and decrypts the (K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~) payload. Using received factors,
the HSS decrypts the (K~ME~\|K~ME~_SIG\|R~ME~) payload. The HSS validates the
K~ME~_SIG using the ME Public Key. If validation succeeds, the HSS stores the
K~ME~ in the subscription record database in association with the bound IMEI.
The HSS generates its own hash of the K~ME~, the NW_SIG, using decrypted R~ME~
as a freshness parameter.
10\. The HSS sends the S6a response (e.g. Update Location Response) to the
MME, including the NW_SIG in the new AVP.
11\. The response is delivered to the UE in a NAS response.
12\. The ME validates the received NW_SIG. If validation succeeds, the ME
activates the K~ME~ in its secure memory for binding compliance.
##### 5.4.4.2.3.4 Network Control of Binding Feature {#network-control-of-
binding-feature .H6}
For normal operation of the binding feature the HSS has to clearly know
whether or not the K~ME~ is established in the device associated with
authenticated subscription. If this knowledge is uncertain, e.g. the device is
transferred from another MNO and K~ME~ cannot be obtained before the initial
network access, or the HSS needs to obtain the device\' IMEI before selecting
the K~ME~, the HSS has to assume that K~ME~ is unknown. In such case the
binding verification has to be omitted for the initial network entry, i.e. the
AV should not be pre-processed (the RAND is not encrypted). Consequently, UE
also should be made aware that binding verification is omitted, and post-
processing (decryption) of RAND should be bypassed.
This constitutes Control of the Binding Feature retained by the HSS.
Several alternatives could be considered to indicate to the UE that the AV
sent by the HSS is or is not pre-processed. Each alternative presented in this
clause leaves the use of binding feature completely under control of the HSS
with no involvement of MME, eNB, or UICC. Other indication alternatives could
be considered as well.
For example, indication can be provided by setting Bit 1 of AMF field to \'1\'
for the AV with encrypted RAND. This means that HSS has to decide on setting
this bit appropriately before the AV is computed. Setting this bit to \'0\'
(default) would indicate a regular un-processed AV with original RAND. Upon
receiving the Authentication Challenge the ME will examine the Bit 1 of the
AMF and determine whether or not to post-process (decrypt) the RAND.
Alternatively, indication can be provided by using special value of 128-bit
RAND. For example, while generating a RAND for the AV targeted to omit pre-
processing, the HSS will truncate the RAND to 64 most significant bits, and
then fill the remaining 64 least significant bits of RAND with the copy of the
64 most significant bits remaining random. Upon receiving the RAND, the ME
will check if each half of the RAND is an exact copy of the other half, and if
so, will pass the AV to the UICC unprocessed. Otherwise, the RAND will be
decrypted before being sent to the UICC. To avoid possible collisions, after
the RAND is encrypted the HSS has to check if the resulting encrypted RAND
does not (with a negligible probability) follow the rule of the special RAND,
and if so, HSS will have to purge this AV, and generate the new AV with
another RAND.
In another alternative, the randomly generated 128 bit RAND is truncated to 96
bits, and the 32-bit hash is computed of it. The resulting 32 bit hash is
appended to the retained 96 bits to produce the 128-bit RAND of the AV that
does not have to be post-processed. The UE, upon receiving the AV, will
compute the 32-bit hash of the 96 msb of the received RAND, and compare it to
the remaining 32 bits of the RAND. If match is discovered, the AV is presented
to the UICC unprocessed. Otherwise, the RAND is presented for decryption with
whatever the K~ME~ value is programmed in the ME.
Although alternatives that use special RAND reduce unpredictability of RES,
which may be undesirable, the use of the un-processed vector with special RAND
is expected to be rare, and limited to cases when Binding feature should be
bypassed for the specially equipped device. Indication by the Bit 1 in AMF
does not have any effect on RES unpredictability, and is preferred.
### 5.4.5 Evaluation
Editor\'s Note: Denial of Service and resource exhaust attacks needs to be
taken in to account.
#### 5.4.5.1 User Equipment-based pairings
##### 5.4.5.1.1 Secure Channel pairing
\- The Secure Channel pairing prevents the connection of not-authorized UE to
the network. When the UICC detects its presence in a not-authorized UE (not-
authorized ME or a non-MTC ME), the UE stops working. The network operator or
MTC application user has no information why the UE has stopped working.
\- The exchanges to perform the secure channel pairing are only between the
UICC and the MTC ME. The pairing does not require any additional signalling on
the network.
  * When the USIM detects its presence in not- authorized UE, the > network resources are not consumed since the UE does not try to > connect to the network.
\- There is no signalling (e.g. for attach procedure, mutual authentication
between the UE and the network), no authentication vector consumption.
\- To establish the secure channel, a mutual authentication is performed
between the USIM and the MTC ME.
\- After the secure channel establishment, all the data exchanged between the
USIM and the MTC ME are protected.
\- A secure environment is required in the terminal part of the UE for the
secure channel establishment.
\- This solution create extra cost per MTC ME and per UICC and the UICC should
support secure channel or TLS
\- Secure channel pairing is the mechanism already selected and specified for
Rel-10 Relay Node security to guaranty one-to-one binding between a USIM and a
RN.
\- Fulfills the SA1 requirement on restrict the use of a USIM to specific UEs
and fulfils the requirement that operator should be able to enforce the
restriction.
\- The UICC is under the control of the operator. The USIM checks if the
combination of USIM and MTC ME is authorized and the list of authorized
IMEI(SV) values or IMEI(SV) ranges stored on the USIM can be modified by the
operator thanks to UICC OTA mechanism. In this way the operator can control
the restriction of USIM to specific MTC MEs.
\- Fulfills the SA1 requirement for monitoring that the system should provide
mechanisms to detect change of the association between the MTC ME and the
UICC.
\- The information stored in the file EF~pairing~ provides a mechanism to
detect change of association between a USIM and a MTC ME. The information
stored in the file EF~pairing~ can be read out locally by the maintenance
persons.
\- In case of operator change, i.e. when a new UICC from a new operator is
inserted to a UE on the field, this solution does not provide a mechanism how
to install the new shared secret or certificate in the UE needed for the
secure channel.
\- In case the UICC needs to be moved from an UE to a new UE which is on the
field, the IMEI and shared secret or certificate need to be updated on the
UICC when the UICC is still hosted by the old UE. If the old UE is no longer
allowed to be associated to the UICC, then the old IMEI value should be
removed from the UICCC when the UICC is hosted by the new UE.
\- In case of certificate based secure channel, the certificate in the UE
cannot in the general case be operator certificate since the operator is not
always known at manufacturing time of MTC ME. In this case the UICC needs to
be updated with the root certificate of the ME vendor when the UE is taken
into use.
\- It is not possible to manipulate the data that controls the pairing on the
UICC from when the UICC is sent by the operator until the UICC is in a UE that
can successfully attached to the network. This puts some limitations on
management of allowable pairings, e.g. in cases when the device that will be
paired with a UICC change between the UICC being supplied to the UE owner and
the UICC being actually used to enable network connectivity.
\- For the symmetric key case, if it is necessary to change all the keys that
are held on one device, e.g. due to the device being considered compromised,
then it is necessary to change the key on all UICCs that can be paired with
that device. In addition, all the devices that require the key of the UICCs
that have been updated would also need to be updated.
##### 5.4.5.1.2 USAT application pairing
  * The USAT application pairing prevents the connection of > not-authorized UE to the network. When the UICC detects its > presence in a not-authorized UE (not-authorized ME or a non-MTC > ME), the UE stops working. The network operator or MTC application > user has no information why the UE has stopped working.
  * The data exchange to perform the USAT application pairing is > performed only between the UICC and the MTC ME. The pairing does > not require any additional signalling on the network.
  * When the USIM detects its presence in not authorized UE, the network > resources are not consumed since the UE does not try to connect to > the network.
\- There is no signalling (e.g. for attach procedure, mutual authentication
between the UE and the network), no authentication vector consumption.
  * The security of the pairing depends on how secure the MTC ME is. The > security requirements that it should not be possible to modify the > IMEI already exist today (see [12] and [13]).

  * Exchange of IMEI value between the ME and the UICC is not integrity > protected and encrypted.
  * Fulfills the SA1 requirement on restrict the use of a USIM to > specific UEs and fulfils the requirement that operator should be > able to enforce the restriction.
\- The UICC is under the control of the operator. The USIM checks if the

  * The MTC ME should support the USAT functionality.

##### 5.4.5.1.3 PIN verification pairing
  * The PIN verification pairing prevents the connection of > not-authorized UE to the network. When the UICC detects its > presence in a not-authorized UE (not-authorized ME or a non-MTC > ME), the UE stops working. The network operator or MTC application > user has no information why the UE has stopped working.
  * The exchanges to perform the PIN verification pairing are only > between the UICC and the MTC ME. The pairing does not require any > additional signalling on the network.
  * When the USIM detects its presence in not authorized UE, the network > resources are not consumed since the UE does not try to connect to > the network.
\- There is no signalling (e.g. for attach procedure, mutual authentication
between the UE and the network), no authentication vector consumption.
  * PIN verification pairing could rely on existing PIN verification > command already available on UE. But the PIN value should be > stored in the MTC ME.
  * The provisioning of PIN value in the MTC ME for pairing purpose is a > new feature since the existing PIN verification is a user > authentication without storage of PIN value in the ME. A secure > environment is required in MTC ME for the storage of PIN value.
  * The storage of PIN value in the MTC ME for pairing purpose requires > a method to provision or personalize the PIN value in the MTC ME, > which can be realized via off-line provisioning or remotely, e.g. > sending PIN to UICC though OTA and to device via OMA DM..
  * The entropy of the PIN secret is low, thus is subject to brute force > attacks
  * The security of the pairing depends on how secure the MTC ME is.
  * PIN value is sent in clear on the interface between the MTC ME and > the UICC, which makes it possible for an attacker to wire-tap on > the interface and find out the PIN. This risk can partially be > mitigated by the operator, e.g. the operator can change the PIN > frequently.
  * Fulfills the SA1 requirement on restrict the use of a USIM to > specific UEs and fulfils the requirement that operator should be > able to enforce the restriction.
\- The UICC is under the control of the operator. The USIM checks if the

  * Pairing methods using Secure Channel, USAT mechanisms are based on > existing 3GPP and ETSI standards.

#### 5.4.5.2 Network based pairings
##### 5.4.5.2.1 IMSI-IMEI binding in HSS

  * The solution requires no new functionality on the UE.

\- Therefore there is neither need for additional signalling nor need for

## 5.5 Privacy concern
### 5.5.1 Issue Details
Some types of UEs can be linked to an individual. Contrary to normal UEs, UEs
used for MTC are often not under the direct control of the particular
individual (i.e. cannot turn it off) and may be controlled by another party.
Therefore it is necessary to investigate privacy in the context of Machine
Type Communication.
In 3GPP network layer, there are many types of sensitive information. When
analysing the privacy threats, it is necessary to distinguish privacy
sensitive information from other sensitive data. In the context of MTC,
identity information and location information can be considered privacy
sensitive information.
Different parties could invade an individual\'s privacy due to excessive
and/or unauthorised monitoring of privacy sensitive information.
Some types of UEs may be used to trace a child to prevent him/her from being
lost or kidnapped. In this case the location information of the UE should be
sent to the MTC application periodically. In this scenario if the UE detaches
from the network or is detached by the network, the MTC server should be
noticed of this change and take proper action.
Note: There is a category of MTC applications that depend on legal location
tracking. The MTC privacy concern feature does not apply to this category of
MTC applications.
### 5.5.2 Threats
Privacy breach due to (unnecessary) collection of location information of an
UE that can be linked to an individual.
Privacy sensitive information sent by a UE which is not allowed to do so.
Privacy sensitive information requested by or sent towards a MTC server which
is not allowed to do so.
If eavesdropped, the temporary identity can be actually used by attackers to
trace the actions of the subscriber of the UE over an extended period of time,
which would seriously affect subscriber identity confidentiality.
### 5.5.3 Security Requirements
\- It should be possible to prevent tracking of location information for some
types of UE.
\- The temporary identity allocated to an UE by the network should be
reallocated based on operator policy, e.g. after it has been used more than a
few number of times, or for longer time than a certain time span, or event
triggering is received (e.g. periodic location update).
\- The network should explicitly reveal UE status, such as online/offline,
idle or connected to authorized parties only, e.g. to an authorized SCS in
relation to monitoring feature, cf. clause 5.11 Monitoring.
\- Network should be able to verify whether a message contains any privacy
sensitive information.
\- Network should be able to perform authorization check of (a) UE which is
sending privacy sensitive information and (b) of MTC server which is
requesting / is receiving the privacy sensitive information.
\- Privacy sensitive information transmitted to MTC server via network should
be protected.
Editor\'s Note: The last three requirements above are FFS. It needs to be
clarified why the network should be able to verify if a message contains
privacy sensitive information, and what an authorization check in network
helps if a device or MTC server has already sent privacy sensitive
information.
\- It should be possible to guarantee legal privacy information collection not
to be interrupted or the interruption can be detected in time.
### 5.5.4 Solutions
#### 5.5.4.0 General
UEs may be detached from the network when not communicating to prevent
unnecessary collection of location information by the network. Hence the UE
will not perform mobility management procedures. Only when the UE is triggered
or when a given requirement is reached and the UE needs to transmit data to
the MTC application, it will reconnect to the network.
The detach procedure can be either initiated by the UE or by the network.
Furthermore, one can distinguish whether the UE or the network has control
over the enforcement of the location privacy mechanism.
The UE may need to provide an ability that allows its user to set the
transmission privacy configuration. The UE may need to provide an ability to
transmit location tracking information in emergency case.
Editor Note: How to trigger the detached UE is FFS in SA2
In order to avoid temporary identity being used as a sobriquet of the UE by
attackers to trace the actions of the subscriber over an extended period of
time, a lifetime can be set for the temporary identity allocated for the UE
and a timer can be started. When the timer expires, a new temporary identity
should be allocated for the UE.
Editor Note: If the timer is set on UE side, new signalling procedure or
modification of existing signalling procedure are needed.
#### 5.5.4.1 UE based method
The UE will detach from the network when a given condition is reached, for
example after a certain period of inactivity in communication. The condition
may be configurable on the UE by its user.
NOTE 1: The mechanism has to be implemented such that the UE cannot be forced
to stay attached by, for example, transmitting certain signals to the UE.
NOTE 2: There may be cases where the MTC service provider does not want the UE
to detach, for example, when receiving MTC application data or new software
(e.g. device firmware). In those cases the MTC service provider can probably
force the UE to stay attached. There are thus scenario\'s in which the
mechanism can be bypassed.
#### 5.5.4.2 Network based method
The network can detach the UEs based on the transmission privacy configuration
which was configured by users.
When user adjusts the privacy configuration, the network should be notified.
Editor\'s Note: Additional security for privacy configurability, visibility
and security for overriding of user-set privacy configuration is FFS. How to
notify user\'s privacy configuration adjusting to the network (e.g. send it
along with the NAS message during a period of time) is FFS.
Figure 5.5.4.2-1: Solution for network based method
The following is a description of the steps in figure 5.5.4.2-1.
Step 1: This is the normal attach procedure as described in TS 24.008 [34] and
TS 24.301 [35].
Step 2: This is the normal UMTS/EPS AKA procedure as described in TS 24.008
[34] and TS 24.301 [35].
Step 3: This configuration function allows user to configure his/her privacy
detach conditions.
Step 4: UE notifies the configuration to MME/SGSN/MSC.
Step5: If user has adjusted the privacy configuration, UE sends the
notification adjusting to MME/SGSN/MSC.
Editor\'s Note: the detail of how to notify user\'s privacy configuration
adjusting to the network (e.g. send it along with the NAS message during a
period of time) is FFS.
### 5.5.5 Evaluation
Editor\'s Note: Additional security for privacy configurability, visibility
and security for overriding of user-set privacy configuration, for emergency
transmission is FFS.
## 5.6 UE Power Consumption Optimizations
### 5.6.1 Issue Details
The Low Power Consumption is intended for use with UEs that work in cases of
power sensitive, and some SIMTC mechanisms are critically required for low
power consumption.
Low power consumption use cases are defined in TS 22.368 [9] where UEs are
applied. These types of UEs include gas metering and animal, cargo, prisoner,
elderly and children tracking. TS 22.368 [9] also states the critical
requirements of low power consumption for UEs, because it is not easy to re-
charge or replace the battery in these cases. This creates the need for system
enhancements that would minimize the power consumption of UEs.
Some security impacts may exist induced by mechanisms for low power
consumption. There is no need to have an independent security solution for low
power consumption, but either MTC\'s Network Solutions or end-to-end solutions
should always consider security of low power consumption.
There is a type of UEs which has only a one-off battery. It\'s impossible to
replace or recharge the battery of the device. This type of UE is vulnerable
for spamming SMS attack which may exhaust the battery of the device.
### 5.6.2 Threats
Some security impacts may exist induced by system improvement for low power
consumption in the future.
### 5.6.3 Security Requirements
The system security improvement over 3GPP network security should consider
lower power consumption for UEs.
Editor\'s Note: Further re-wording of the above requirement need to be
considered.
The solutions of anti-spamming should be implemented at the network side.
Solutions requiring UE involved will cause battery consumption inevitably.
### 5.6.4 Solutions
### 5.6.4.1 General description
Seven solutions have been proposed in SA2\'s TR23.887 [26] and the main ideas
for these solutions are extending Paging cycle/DRX cycle and initiating UE
periodic registrations (Attach/Detach). The user data and control signalling
transmission protection is using the legacy LTE security mechanism, and the
analysis here focus on whether the transfer of parameters between UE and
network is protected:
\- Solution1 of \"Paging cycles\": The characteristic of this solution is that
the Maximum paging/DRX cycles are extended with longer values which can be
negotiated between UE and network using attach procedure or TAU procedure. The
paging/DRX parameters can be protected by NAS security context in UE and MME.
\- Solution 2 of \"Extending DRX using UE Assistance Information\": UE
Assistance Information message is sent to eNB after RRC Connection
Reconfiguration procedure, and UE extended DRX is delivered to UE through RRC
Connection Reconfiguration setup message or RRC connection release message.
The UE Assistance Information message and paging/DRX parameters can be
protected by RRC security context between UE and eNB.
\- Solution 3 of \"Power Saving State for Devices\": The basic idea is that a
UE can be configured so that the UE is reachable for downlink data only during
the time that the UE is in connected state plus an active time period
reachable for paging after the UE changed to idle state, and UE will continue
to perform periodic registrations procedures with the timer value given by the
network. The periodic timer value is protected by NAS security.
\- Solution 4 of \"Attach/detach\": Three methods: 1. UE periodically attaches
to the network and waits to see if there is an MT SMS for the UE; 2. Based on
the communication frequency, the network determines the periodic timer value
and provides it to UE through Attach/Detach message; 3. UEs and the network
are configured to enter detached state when the communication is over.
Periodic timer value is protected by NAS security context and configuration
data can be protected by OMA DM security.
\- Solution 5 of \"Transmission delay until better coverage conditions\": When
coverage conditions are not good in idle mode, delay data transmission until
better coverage conditions. No security is related.
\- Solution 6 of \"Long DRX cycles in connected mode\": Network provides
extended DRX cycle for connected mode in RRC/MAC message. Extended DRX cycle
can be protected by RRC security context.
\- Solution 7 of \"Factors for determining extended DRX\": This solution gives
the factors which may influence the decision of extended long DRX for both
idle mode and connected mode. No security is related.
The UE Power Consumption Optimizations are mainly extending current messages
with new parameters (paging/DRX cycle/Timer values/indicators) or configuring
UE and network with new parameters, and the user data and control signallings
transmission protection are using the legacy LTE security mechanism. From
security point of view, the current EPS security mechanism can ensure the
security of all these solutions.
## 5.7 Security of Small Data Transmission
### 5.7.1 Issue Details
SA2 is currently considering mechanism to transmit and receive small amount of
data efficiently through 3GPP system [26] based on the Small Data Transmission
requirements defined in TS 22.368 [9]. According to the current solutions
under consideration in SA2, small data is transfer over the NAS signalling or
using user plane (Fast Path/Connectionless) with reduced signalling caused by
idle-connected mode transitions.
As the SA2 solutions consider that small data is transferred when the UE is in
idle mode, it may be required to protect the small data messages.
Editor\'s Note: Further inputs are needed from SA2 on this issue
### 5.7.2 Threats
Editor\'s note: Threats due to unprotected neighbour cell measurements should
be studied if those are supported for small data. To be checked with SA2 and
RAN2.
#### 5.7.2.1 Small data encapsulation in the NAS
NAS PDU based solutions under consideration in SA2 TR 23.887 [26] for \"small
data transmission\" allow UEs to arbitrarily create NAS content and traffic.
An increasing amount of devices creating NAS traffic is a scalability problem
that has to be mitigated by existing or new methods..
Editor\'s note: Small data when transferred over the NAS signalling may
overload the NAS, strictly control protocol, with UP content. Since such
content will be generated by potentially hundreds of millions devices,
overload protection and protection against DOS attacks might be necessary in
MME. Further analysis of how to protect the MME is needed. Whether this is a
valid threat is FFS.
There may be no pre-established NAS security context in transfer data via
optimized SMS solution. Thus the small data transmission cannot be protected
by valid security context and can be easily tampered or intercepted by the
attacker. Sometimes small data is sensitive and important because it may be
related to emergency event or commerce. Once it is tampered or intercepted,
the consequence can be serious.
The SCS is the source of MTC service applications. For MT small data
transmission, SCS generates small data and delivers it to related UEs through
operator network. In case the SCS is outside the operator domain, some
security attacks on Tsp interface may exist. A forged SCS may send a fake
small data to the network and then the network is utilized by the attacker to
trigger UEs, or a SCS which is not authorized to deliver small data for UEs
may proceed this illegal action. This may lead to a false action of UE, waste
of the UE\'s power consumption, and even a DOS attack to the network. And for
MO small data transmission, SCS is the destination of small data. The small
data may be related to some users\' sensitive privacy information, if the
network connects to a forged or threatened SCS controlled by attackers, the
small data will be delivered to that SCS and then the attacker can obtain the
users\' privacy information. In addition, a normal UE may send fake MO small
data to SCSs through operator network to get some services, or a malicious but
legitimate UE which is only permitted to receive small data (e.g. simple
controller) may send UE MO small data to SCSs, or yet another malicious but
legitimate UE which has MO small data function may deliver fake small data to
SCSs with which UE has no MO small data service subscription, or millions of
malicious UEs may send MO small data simultaneously to perform DoS attacks on
the operator network or SCSs. These may lead to false action of SCSs, waste of
network resources, waste of SCS resource, free service, wrong charging,
privacy information leak from SCS, DoS attacks on Network or SCSs and so on
The threats regarding small data when not used in combination with device
trigger are different. For device trigger, the source is always SCS and the
device trigger message is used to ask UEs to take some action accordingly. The
network aims to filter the fake trigger message from unauthorised SCS and
common UEs. But for small data transmission, the source can be either SCS
(Mobile Terminated sent to UE) or UE (Mobile Originated sent from UE). For MT
small data the threats described above apply when it is not used in
combination with device trigger and the threats in clause 5.1.2 apply when
used in combination with device trigger. For MO small data, the threats
described above apply.
Editor\'s Note: Threats regarding the small data when not passing through the
SCS need further study.
#### 5.7.2.2. Small data fast path in the user plane
**Threats to sensitive network information**
SA2 solution currently considered in SA2 TR 23.887 V0.6.0 [26] (small data
fast path) is based on the principle of providing information to the UE about
the end-point of the PDN Connection or its bearer(s) in the SGW (SGW S1-U
F-TEID). From security perspective, information like SGW S1-U F-TEID reveals
the network topology (like number of S-GWs) and also revealing network privacy
information (core network internals like S-GW IP addresses) lead to attacks
(like flooding) on the core network. The operational details of a core network
are sensitive information that operators are reluctant to expose it to the
rest of the world. In order to hide network topology, it is required that the
information provided to the UE for small data transmission (small data fast
path) should not provide the operational details of the core network entities
like SGW IP address to the UE.
Editor\'s Note: It is ffs on this threats analysis topology and privacy issue.
**Threats to small data user plane traffic**
The intention with the Small data fast path solution (\'Alternative A: Small
Data Fast Path\' in SA2 TR 23.887 [26]) is that small data can be sent in user
plane when the UE is in idle mode without requiring the normal transition to
connected mode in AS-layer in LTE systems. Therefore in this small data fast
path setting, the UE would send user plane traffic without setting up the
regular Access Stratum (AS) security and because of this, it is not possible
to encrypt or integrity protect the user plane traffic between the UE and the
eNB. As a result of this, an attacker can inject traffic and eavesdrop on
subscribers\' traffic. Protection of the small data transfer traffic would be
desirable to protect the robustness of the charging and the integrity and
confidentiality of the small data traffic on user plane. It should be noted
that the above analysed threats for traffic injection and eavesdropping are
also applicable to regular user plane, and therefore it can be questioned
whether any additional protection is needed for small data traffic due to
those threats.
**Threats to Bearer Resource ID**
**Eavesdropping attacks**
Small data fast path solution uses so called Bearer Resource ID which is sent
by the UE to the eNB. The eNB derives the SGW S1-U F-TEID (i.e. S-GW UL TEID
and S-GW IP address) from the Bearer Resource ID and uses this information to
route small data on the backhaul link. Therefore the Bearer Resource ID cannot
be carried in the encrypted payload part of the small data message (in case
small data is encrypted), but it needs to be carried in the Uu radio protocol
headers, for example as a new IE. Another reason for carrying the Bearer
Resource ID in the Uu radio protocol headers is that the eNB is not assumed to
interpret the payload part of the small data message, which is likely used to
carry an IP packet. As there is no security association between the UE and
eNB, the Bearer Resource ID cannot be integrity protected between the UE and
eNB and consequently the eNB has no secure knowledge about which UE sent the
small data message.
As a consequence the Bearer Resource ID is exposed for eavesdropping and
modification on the Uu interface.
If an attacker eavesdrops and gets to know a valid Bearer Resource ID, the
attacker could inject small data traffic on Uu interface by masquerading as
the victim UE. The eNB passes on the small data to the S-GW using GTP-U. If
the victim UE is still attached and under that S-GW, the EPS bearer for small
data will be enabled at the S-GW and the S-GW will end the small data to the
P-GW over the EPS bearer, and consequently the IP packet in the small data
will be sent from the P-GW onwards, e.g. to the internet . If encryption was
applied for small data in the case above, the S-GW will try to decrypt the
fake small data payload (IP packet). Since the attacker is not assumed to have
the encryption keys, the decryption will result to arbitrary trash. Therefore
the fake small data payload (IP packet) will be discarded by the first node,
e.g. P-GW, which tries to interpret the IP headers. However, if the small data
payload (IP packet) is not encrypted, it will be sent onwards by the S-GW and
P-GW, e.g. to the internet. It should be noted that the above analysed threats
for traffic injection are also applicable to regular user plane, and therefore
it can be questioned whether any additional protection is needed for Bearer
Resource ID due to those threats.
Another threat related to Bearer Resource ID eavesdropping is as follows. If
the fast path for a victim UE is enabled but not active, there is no state for
the victim UE in the eNB. If the attacker now sends small data by masquerading
as the victim UE, the RRC connection will be established with the attacker (It
has not been decided how small data is sent over Uu but some RRC signalling is
assumed to be needed). If encryption is used for small data in this case, the
attacker likely cannot send small data to the internet (see previous threat),
but if he is able to do so for some reason, e.g. encryption is not used, then
also the possible downlink response small data message would be routed to the
attacker over the Uu so in practice the small data session would be hijacked.
On regular user plane set-up case an attacker is able to set-up RRC
connection, but the attacker would be detected by the MME when NAS integrity
check of the Service Request fails and the RRC connection would be aborted
before any user plane data can be sent. One possible solution to mitigate this
threat could be to integrity protect the small data messages between the UE
and S-GW. It could be sufficient to integrity protect the small data payload
(IP packet). Then, if the integrity check of uplink small data fails at the
S-GW, the S-GW should discard the small data message and send a GTP-U error
indication to the eNB, which would then know to abort the small data fast path
and release the RRC connection . However, if integrity protection of small
data would fail at the S-GW for an already active fast path, the S-GW could
silently discard the small data packet. This is because otherwise one fake
small data packet could be used to tear down the fast path.
**Modification attacks**
The case when an attacker modifies the Bearer Resource ID on Uu interface can
be divided into two subcases. In the first subcase the Bearer Resource ID is
modified by an attacker to a value for which there exists a small data enabled
EPS bearer. This case is basically the same as the Bearer Resource ID
eavesdropping threat above. In the second subcase the Bearer Resource ID is
modified by an attacker to a value for which there does not exist any small
data enabled EPS bearer. In this case the small data message will be discarded
by the eNB if it is not able to derive a valid SGW S1-U F-TEID from the Bearer
Resource ID (the details of how to derive SGW S1-U F-TEID from the Bearer
Resource ID are FFS in SA2), or the small data message will be discarded at
the latest at S-GW which will not recognize the SGW S1-U F-TEID as valid one.
The details of the Bearer Resource ID are under study in SA2. One possibility
is that the Bearer Resource ID consists of S-GW UL TEID and a \"S-GW
identifier\" which the eNB then resolves to S-GW IP address. This way the S-GW
IP address would not be exposed to the UEs, but the TEID would be. Having TEID
\"as is\" in the Bearer Resource ID has the benefit that the eNB does not need
to resolve the TEID from the Bearer Resource ID for each small data fast path
establishment separately. Instead the eNB resolves the \"S-GW identifier\" to
S-GW IP address and may cache this information. Different mechanisms could be
used so that eavesdroppers could not collude network topology information from
the \"S-GW identifier\", e.g. there could be many to one mapping from several
\"S-GW identifiers\" to one S-GW IP address. TEID is a value which identifies
a GTP-U tunnel endpoint and it is assigned by the node who is expecting to
receive traffic on that tunnel. TEID is assigned per IP address and it has a
meaning only when used together with that IP address. For example, an attacker
would not gain anything by using a TEID from one Bearer Resource ID with
\"S-GW identifier\" from another Bearer Resource ID.
**Threats to RRC security**
Another threat is that due to lack of RRC security, RRC Connection Release is
not protected and an attacker could drop an RRC connection which is used for
small data by sending an RRC Connection Release to the victim UE. On the other
hand the small data fast path is assumed to be quite short lived (SA2 TR
23.887 mentions timeout value 5 secs [26]) and is assumed to contain typically
one uplink IP packet and one downlink packet. So with careful timing an
attacker could prevent the victim UE to receive the downlink small data packet
by an unauthorized release of the RRC connection. However, the attacker could
do that anyway by doing radio jamming when he detects small data fast path
being set up.
Editor\'s Note: The details of the optimized Uu signalling are for further
study by RAN and consequently the impact on RAN security architecture, e.g.
how and whether to protect Uu signalling needs further study.
Editor\'s Note: The intention is to turn this editor\'s note into normal text
as it gets resolved; therefore it is a bit lengthy. When the UE sends an
uplink small data packet, the eNB associates the data radio bearer on which it
received the packet with the UE. If there is a subsequent downlink message
sent from the S-GW towards the UE, the eNB will use the same radio bearer for
the downlink packet as was used by the UE for the uplink packet. If the uplink
packet contains an identifier for the radio bearer a MITM attacker can change
this identifier so that the down link message will not reach the UE. If the
uplink packet does not contain an explicit identifier, but the eNB rather
identifies the radio bearer based on timeslots, frequencies or similar, the
MITM attacker will be allocated different timeslots, frequencies etc. by the
eNB, so the effect is the same. The MITM attacker may reach the same effect,
by simply dropping the downlink reply packet. The UE would not receive any
downlink packets until the S-GW decided to page the UE via the MME instead of
using the established path directly via the eNB. It therefore needs to be
ensured that the timeout of an active fast path is reasonably short. The
effect of this attack with respect to radio jamming is FFS. One effect is that
an application server may believe that the downlink packet has reached the UE
since the attack is not visible to the UE, the NW or the application server.
However, IP networks are best effort by design so an application server
assuming an IP packet reaches the destination host without getting an
acknowledgement in return makes an incorrect assumption about the network
properties.
### 5.7.3 Security requirements
The small data transmission using small data encapsulation in the NAS payload
have to be protected against overloading attack on MME for EPS.
Editor\'s Note: How to provide NAS DOS protection for small data transfer is
FFS. Dedicated MME can be considered as one option.
The small data should be integrity protected (for 3G/LTE system). Integrity
protection between the UE and S-GW should be applied to small data fast path
messages to protect against fast path establishment with unauthorized UEs.
Editor\'s Note: It is ffs for all small data solutions, whether to integrity
protect either the payload of the small data message or the whole small data
message for the benefit of protecting the network and/or the data itself.
The small data may be confidentiality protected.
The 3GPP network should be able to determine that the SCS is authorized for
small data transmission over Tsp interface.
Editor\'s Note: It is ffs whether SCS can decide if downlink data is small
data or not, or if this decision is to be done by 3GPP networks entities, e.g.
SGW. This is to be decided by SA2 and it will have an impact if there needs to
be authorization requirement for SCS or not.
The 3GPP network should be able to determine that the UE is authorized for MO
uplink small data transmission.
The network information provided to the UE for small data transmission should
not expose the network topology and network sensitive information (e.g.
network nodes IP addresses).
### 5.7.4 Solutions
#### 5.7.4.1 Small data transfer in NAS PDU
##### 5.7.4.1.1 General description
MO analysis for small data transmission
According to TR 23.887 [26], for the LTE procedure for MO IP packet delivery,
small data and its EPS Bearer ID are delivered in NAS PDUs of a new initial
layer 3 message, and this NAS PDU is sent in the NAS container in the RRC
Connection Setup Complete message. For the first two solutions for MO IP
packet delivery of small data solutions in TR 23.887 [26] they says:
\"..._The NAS PDU is a new form of initial layer 3 message that includes the
IP packet and its EPS Bearer ID in an encrypted IE. This NAS PDU is sent in
the NAS container in the RRC Connection Setup Complete message. The
unencrypted part of this new initial layer 3 message in the NAS PDU carries
the \"KSI and sequence number\" IE and the MME uses this, and the S-TMSI, to
identify the security context to decrypt the IP packet and EPS Bearer ID_.\"
We can see that first two SA2 solution use partly ciphered security solution
for initial L3 message. However, according to TS 33.401 [13], initial L3
message should be integrity protected but not ciphered. So it needs to find a
method to solve this problem for SA2\'s solutions.
For the third solution in SA2\'s TR 23.887 [26], it transmits small data in a
\"UPLINK_GENERIC_NAS_TRANSPORT\". If it is initial L3 message, it also needs
to find a method for partly ciphered small data transmission. If it is not
initial L3 message, it can use current EPS security mechanism to protect.
MT analysis for small data transmission
For MT IP packets delivery in all three SA2\'s solution, small data is in a
NAS PDU of S1 Downlink NAS Transport message after the paging procedure, so
the IP packets can be protected by current EPS NAS security mechanism that
provides confidentiality and integrity protection for the whole S1 Downlink
NAS Transport message.
##### 5.7.4.1.2 Solution 1: Partly ciphering
The partly ciphered security mechanism is necessary for initial uplink layer 3
NAS message of MO packet delivery for SA2\'s solutions, in which the new
initial L3 message is used to carry the small data packets in an encrypted IE
(some other information like UE\'s EPS Bearer ID may also be included in the
encrypted IE). The network (MME/SGSN) firstly needs to recognize that whether
the initial layer 3 message from UE is ciphered or not. It can be achieved by
adding a partly ciphering indicator in the new initial L3 message, i.e. UE set
the current \"Security header type\" IE\'s reserved value, e.g. \"0101\" to
\"Integrity protected and partly ciphered\". So the network can identify the
initial L3 which carries the small data is partly confidentiality protected
and then generate key stream to decipher this partly ciphered initial layer 3
message.
In the other hand, the generation of the key stream is another issue that
should be considered. The method can be as following: the key stream used for
partly ciphering is derived through EEA. The EEA input parameters include the
\"LENGTH\" which is set to the real length of data needed to be ciphered and
the other EEA input parameters remain the same,, so the length of generated
key stream is the same as that of data needed to be ciphered. Then the
plaintext data is encrypted by applying the key stream, which perform XOR
operation between the data needed to be ciphered in initial layer 3 message
and the key stream. The encrypted data is encapsulated in NAS PDUs.
Based on above analysis, the partly secure protection of small data in NAS
message for MO IP packets delivery can be done as followings: UE performs
Attach activating a PDN connection or TAU (with an already active PDN a
connection).Then UE sets the current \"Security header type\" IE\'s reserved
value, e.g. \"0101\" to \"Integrity protected and partly ciphered\". Small
data is included in NAS PDU which is a new form of initial layer 3 message.
This NAS PDU is sent in the NAS container in the RRC Connection Setup Complete
message. The eNB forwards the partly encrypted IP packets to the MME in the
S1AP Initial UE message. The MME identifies the small data is integrity
protected and partly confidentiality protected and then generates a key stream
to decipher partly ciphered initial layer 3 message.
SA2\'s control plane solutions include NAS solution 1 in clause 5.1.1.3.1, NAS
solution 2 in clause 5.1.1.3.2, and T5-based solution in clause 5.1.1.3.3 in
SA2\'s TR 23.887, all these solutions need to encapsulate small data in NAS
PDUs and transfer them in NAS messages. Besides, the partly ciphering solution
is just used to protect the small data in NAS message between UE and MME, but
it does not care how to transfer the small data to the target SCS/AS from MME.
So the partly ciphering solution suits for all three control plane solutions.
Following description is the security operation for SDT control plane
solutions and it only intends to provide security protection between UE and
MME:
**a. Optimized LTE message sequence for the transfer of MO small data
packets**
Figure 5.7.4.1.2-1: Optimized LTE message sequence for the transfer of MO
small data packets
1\. UE requests the UE\'s AS to establish an RRC connection with establishment
cause \'low priority small data\'\'.
2\. eNB accepts the small data type access and returns the RRCConnectionSetup
message.
3\. UE sets the \"Security header type\" IE\'s reserved value, e.g. \"0101\",
to \"Integrity protected and partly ciphered\", generates key stream used for
partly ciphering and then partly ciphers the initial L3 message by applying
the key stream, which performs XOR operation between the data needed to be
ciphered in initial layer 3 message and the key stream. The encrypted IE
including small data is encapsulated in NAS PDU which is a new form of initial
layer 3 message. UE also integrity protects the initial L3 message by
generating a MAC-I.
4\. UE includes security header type, eKSI, encrypted data, SN, and MAC-I in
the new initial L3 message, then sends the NAS PDU in the NAS container to eNB
in the RRC Connection Setup Complete message.
5\. The eNB forwards the partly ciphered NAS PDU to the MME in the S1AP
Initial UE message.
6\. The MME identifies that the small data is integrity protected and partly
confidentiality protected according to the \"Security header type\", finds the
NAS security context by eKSI, then verifies the MAC-I. MME also generates a
key stream that is same as UE\'s to decipher the partly ciphered NAS PDU.
7\. MME sends the small data packets to S-GW/SMSC/IWF.
8\. If there are response data packets to UE, MME receive them and then sends
them to UE through eNB. If there is no response data packet to UE, MME sends
\"UE context release\" signalling to eNB to release RRC connection
immediately.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS in SA3 for partial ciphering solutions as it may
violate the current protocol layer security concepts.

For optimized LTE message sequence for the transfer of one IP packet pair, LTE

Note: This optimization only means that the AS security contexts will not be
used in this solution but the UE still have to support the AS security usage
capability.

#### 5.7.4.2 Small Data Fast Path in User Plane
##### 5.7.4.2.0 General
This clause provides a security solution for Alternative A: Small Data Fast
Path solution in TR 23.887 [26].
##### 5.7.4.2.1 Termination point of security for small data in the network
The basic principle of the Small data fast path solution is that small data
can be sent when the UE is in idle mode without requiring the normal
transition to connected mode in AS-layer in LTE systems. It describes how
small data can be passed in a fast path of the user plane without the
disproportional amount of signalling caused by idle-connected mode transitions
in AS-layer
The LTE AS security context only exists when the UE is in connected mode.
Therefore when the UE is in idle mode, the small data transferred in user
plane traffic cannot be protected between the UE and the eNB with the regular
LTE AS level security context. A new security context that is kept during
idle-connected mode transitions is required for the small data feature. A new
security protocol is also required. These are called as small data transfer
security context and small data transfer security protocol respectively.
The security protection of small data could be terminated either in the eNB or
in the S-GW. The LTE AS security is terminated in the eNB and this may be
secure enough also for small data just as it was for normal UP traffic in pre-
Rel-12, but terminating the security in the core NW is clearly beneficial from
a security perspective. In this solution security is terminated in the S-GW
for the following reasons:
1) If the security for the small data would be terminated in the eNB, the MME
would need to push down a new additional security context for small data to
the eNB for each UE used for small data. The eNB would then need to keep a
state and store a small data transfer security context for each UE used for
small data even when the UE is in idle mode. The current concept in LTE is
that the eNB does not keep a state for UEs in idle mode. Since the S-GW needs
to keep a UE context anyway for small data fast path, the security context can
be kept as a subset of that UE context, i.e. the security handling does not
add anything in.
2) Also, if the security for the small data would be terminated in the eNB
these security contexts would need to be transferred to the new eNB whenever
an idle mode UE moves into a new cell served by a different eNB similarly as
is done today for connected mode UEs.
Editor\'s Note: A similar issue needs to be considered also for solution A wrt
mobility as the S-GW needs to be updated with the address of the eNB on which
the UE currently camps when the UE moves. Otherwise, the S-GW could not
deliver downlink small data to the idle UE in an efficient way. The issue of
small data transfer at inter-eNB change needs further study in SA2.
Editor\'s Note: Terminating the security for small data in the S-GW may impact
existing solutions like LIPA and SIPTO. Security issues related to LIPA and
SIPTO\@LN are ffs, cf. also Editor\'s note relating to LIPA and SIPTO in TR
23.887 [26].
##### 5.7.4.2.2 General description of proposed solution
The figure 5.7.4.2.2-1 below depicts a solution for \'Alternative A: Small
Data Fast Path\' in TR 23.887 [26] by providing a new separate security
protection between the UE and the S-GW (this is shown with the thick dotted
line). This new security protection includes optional encryption and integrity
protection.
{width="4.920833333333333in" height="3.9715277777777778in"}
Figure 5.7.4.2.2-1: Security context for small data transfer of the user plane
in LTE systems
NOTE: In the figure above, the thick lines show the normal LTE AS security
protection of the user plane. The dotted lines show the small data transfer
security protection of the user plane.
To enable the security protection of the user plane between the UE and the
S-GW, the UE and S-GW have to establish a new security context for small data
transfer.
It should be noted that the two types of security contexts (normal LTE AS
security context and small data transfer security context) can be completely
independent.
##### 5.7.4.2.3 Small data transfer security context
The small data transfer security context is used whenever the S-GW and UE need
to protect (or unprotect) small data.
When the UE attaches to LTE systems or is handed over from another radio
access technology to LTE, the K~ASME~ is established between the UE and the
MME. A new small data transfer security key K~SDT~ is derived from the K~ASME~
at attach and IRAT handover.
The K~SDT~ could for example be derived from the K~ASME~ using the Key
Derivation Function (KDF) defined for LTE. The K~SDT~ could be derived as
follows:
K~SDT~ = KDF(K~ASME~, other parameter(s))
Other parameters in the key derivation can include e.g. parameters to ensure
freshness of K~SDT~ .
The MME provides K~SDT~ to the S-GW using (modified) EPS bearer establishment
and modification procedures whenever needed. K~SDT~ is the basis of small data
transfer security context which is used for the protection of the small data
between the UE and S-GW.
The K~SDT~ is stored in the S-GW and it could be changed as often as the
K~ASME~ is changed (for example, the MME could send a new K~SDT~ to the S-GW
whenever the K~ASME~ is changed). In this way, there would always be a K~SDT~
corresponding to a K~ASME~. A good thing with changing the small data transfer
security context as often as the K~ASME~, is that the UE and the MME are
synchronized on the K~ASME~ and hence there would be an implicit
synchronization of the K~SDT~. Additional synchronization is achieved by
comprising the Key Set Identifier (KSI) of the currently active K~ASME~ also
in the traffic between the UE and the S-GW. This KSI would then also indicate
which K~SDT~ should be used for the packet in question. The MME would have to
provide the S-GW with the KSI that corresponds to the K~SDT~.
The S-GW can further derive encryption (K~SDT_enc~) and integrity keys
(K~SDT_int~) from K~SDT,~ which can be used for encryption and integrity
protection of small data.
K~SDT_enc~ = KDF(K~SDT~, \"SDT_ENC\", Algorithm identifier, ...)
K~SDT_int~ = KDF(K~SDT~, \"SDT_INT\", Algorithm identifier, ...)
The UE and S-GW also need to share the same encryption and integrity
algorithms for small data protection. One possibility is that the same
algorithms that are used for NAS security are also used for small data
transfer security. But as this restricts the algorithm choice to the subset of
algorithms supported by both MME and S-GW it is better to negotiate the small
data separately.
The algorithms can be negotiated between the UE and MME at the same time when
NAS security algorithms are negotiated and the MME can indicate them to the
S-GW. This means that the MME may have to know which algorithms are supported
by the S-GW.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether the MME should be configured with the
knowledge of which algorithms are supported by the S-GW or whether a protocol
based solution would be preferable.
Since the UE also has the K~ASME~, the UE can derive the same K~SDT~ and
further keys similarly as the S-GW.
Editor\'s Note: It is proposed in TR23.887 v.080 [26] that the small data
transfer security context is kept after creation in the UE and the S-GW
regardless if the fast path is active or not. The security information is not
removed when the fast path is deactivated after timeout or at transition from
ECM-idle to ECM-connected. It needs to be studied when is the proper time to
remove the small data transfer security context from the UE and the S-GW(s),
with which the UE shares a context, and how. This is dependent on how SA2
decides how to handle the UE context in the S-GW in case of small data, since
the security context is supposed to be a subset of the UE context.
Editor\'s Note: How to define the input for key derivation and how the UE gets
it is ffs.
Editor\'s Note: It needs to be studied how a change of security contexts can
be synchronized between UE and S-GW when triggered by a K~ASME~ change, in
particular when small data are being transferred while a new K~ASME~ is
established via AKA and NAS SMC.

Figure 5.7.4.2.3A-1: Protocol stack for small data fast path
Figure above shows the protocol architecture for small data fast path between
the UE, eNB and S-GW. A security protocol to implement SDTSec needs to provide
support for encryption and probably also for integrity and replay protection.
Today AS security is implemented in the RRC for key handling and security
control and in the PDCP for user plane and control plane ciphering and
integrity protection, and NAS security is implemented in the NAS protocol.
Small data fast path security is terminated in the S-GW and therefore the
existing protocols cannot be used. A new security protocol called small data
transfer security protocol (SDTSec) is introduced between the UE and S-GW.
As most other security protocols are tightly coupled to a specific key
management or transport protocol, the SDTSec protocol is based on PDCP (TS
36.323 [44]) and uses the same ciphering and integrity algorithms. Processing
for replay protection etc. can also be re-used from TS 36.323 [44]. The packet
format is shown in figure 5.7.4.2.3A-2.
NOTE: The figure shows the information needed and an example format.
Figure 5.7.4.2.3A-2: SDTSec data format. The exact format can be left to stage
3 groups to decide
Even without security the S-GW should be able to identify the subscriber
(otherwise it cannot do charging). With the SDTSec sequence number (SN) the
normal encryption sync and replay protection is provided. The KSI, a field not
currently present in the LTE PDCP protocol, the UE and S-GW can identify the
correct small data transfer security context.
It will be under the remit of RAN to decide if and how Uu will be developed to
support small data, e.g. whether user plane or control plane will be used to
carry small data over the Uu. If user plane is chosen, the user plane PDCP
encryption does not need be activated when small data fast path is used.
Editor\'s Note: Interaction between fast path and normal mode switching need
further study and also depends on the SA2 decision.
##### 5.7.4.2.4 Small data transfer security context establishment at Attach
procedure
EPS bearers are enabled for small data fast path during MM and SM procedures
(see TR 23.887 clause 5.1.1.3.6.2 [26] for more non-security details). Figure
5.7.4.2.4-1 shows how an existing signalling message sequence for Attach
Procedure is updated for small data fast path.
Figure 5.7.4.2.4-1: Initial Attach procedure for small data fast path
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether and how the confidentiality of the radio
bearer identity associated with the UE when the SGW Bearer Resource ID is sent
from the UE to the eNB during small data radio bearer establishment is
ensured. C.f. long ed-note in 5.7.2.2.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how the S-GW can ensure that the COUNT values do not
wrap around.
The following steps are performed as described in the signalling flow above:
  1. The UE initiates an attach procedure with an MME and provides its \'UE security capability for small data fast path\' to the MME (indicating support of small data fast path, support of ciphering and integrity algorithms).
  2. The MME optionally authenticates the UE and a K~ASME~ is established.
  3. The MME derives K~SDT~ from the K~ASME~, decides which cryptographic algorithms are to be used with small data transfer security, and creates the small data transfer security context.
  4. The MME initiates NAS Security Mode Command procedure with UE in order to establish NAS security. In the same message the MME indicates which cryptographic algorithms are to be used with small data transfer security. This implies additional fields in the NAS SMC. The MME indicates also the identifiers of the keys for small data (KSI) and replays the \'UE security capability for small data fast path\', to the UE in NAS SMC or some other appropriate NAS message.
  5. The UE responds with a NAS Security Mode Response to the MME.
  6. The MME sends a Create Session Request to the selected SGW together with the small data transfer security context (including K~SDT,~ identifiers of security keys for small data (KSI), and selected cryptographic algorithms). The S-GW derives K~SDT_enc~ and K~SDT_int~ from the K~SDT~ key and the cryptographic algorithm identifiers received from the MME.
  7. When the Create Session Request is received by the S-GW, the S-GW enables the EPS bearer for small data fast path and stores the small data transfer security context for the session.
  8. The new EPS bearer is established towards the PGW.
  9. The S-GW sends a Create Session Response and acknowledges that it supports small data fast path and will use it for the established EPS bearer.
  10. The MME creates a SGW Bearer Resource ID. The SGW Bearer Resource ID enables the eNB to derive the SGW S1-U F-TEID, i.e. the UL GTP-U TEID and S-GW IP address. The MME sends an Attach Accept together with an indication which requests the UE to create a new small data transfer security context, and includes also the SGW Bearer Resource ID to the UE.
  11. The UE creates small data transfer security context, it derives K~SDT~ from the K~ASME~, and stores SGW Bearer Resource ID. The UE also derives K~SDT_enc~ and K~SDT_int~ from the K~SDT~ key and the selected cryptographic algorithms identifiers received from the MME in step 4 above.
##### 5.7.4.2.5 UE initiated uplink (UL) small data
Figure 5.7.4.2.5-1 shows how mobile originated small data packet is passed
uplink (UL) and how a subsequent small data IP packet is passed back to the UE
in downlink (DL).
{width="6.260416666666667in" height="4.485416666666667in"}
Figure 5.7.4.2.5-1: UE initiated uplink small data
The following steps describe the signalling flow above:
1\. The UE wants to send an UL IP packet for an idle mode bearer enabled for
small data fast path and
2\. The UE sets up the optimized Uu for small data.
3\. The UE performs protection (integrity and/or encryption) of the small data
using the security protocol called SDTSec and the small data transfer security
context.
4\. The UE sends the protected small data to the eNB over optimized Uu
protocol. The Bearer Resource ID is included in a Uu protocol header or IE.
This is needed since the eNB needs to be able to interpret the Bearer Resource
ID and therefore it cannot be within the security protocol or be encrypted.
5\. The eNB resolves the Bearer Resource ID to S-GW UL TEID and S-GW IP
address, and assembles a GTP-U PDU using information received with small data.
6\. The eNB forwards the GTP-U PDU to the S-GW.
7\. The S-GW receives the GTP-U PDU including the protected small data and
terminates SDTSec (integrity check and/or decryption) using the small data
transfer security context.
8\. The S-GW forwards the GTP-U PDU to the PGW.
9\. The S-GW receives a DL GTP-U PDU on an EPS bearer that has an active fast
path.
10\. The S-GW performs protection (e.g. integrity and/or encryption) of the
small data in the GTP-U PDU using SDTSec and the small data transfer security
context.
11\. The S-GW forwards the GTP-U PDU with the protected small data to the eNB.
12\. The eNB forwards the protected small data to the UE over optimized Uu.
13\. The UE terminates SDTSec (integrity check and/or decryption) of the small
data using the small data transfer security context.
##### 5.7.4.2.6 Network initiated downlink (DL) small data
Figure 5.7.4.2.6-1 shows small data initiated DL, that is, DL data received in
the S-GW on an EPS bearer where fast path is enabled but not active, is
handled as described in the figure below. It should be noted that compared to
when small data is initiated UL, an additional paging of the UE is required.
{width="6.24375in" height="4.801388888888889in"}
Figure 5.7.4.2.6-1: Network initiated downlink data
The following steps describe the signalling flow above:
1\. The S-GW receives a GTP-U PDU from the P-GW.
2\. If the EPS bearer is idle and fast path enabled but not active, then the
S-GW indicates to the MME to start paging the UE.
3\. The MME pages the UE indicating \'DL fast path small data\' as paging
cause.
4\. The UE sets up the optimized Uu for small data.
5\. Protection of the dummy IP packet corresponds to step 3 in clause
5.7.4.2.5.
6\. The UE sends the protected dummy IP packet.
Editor\'s Note: according to an Editor\'s note in TR 23.887 [26], whether the
dummy IP packet is generated in the UE or the eNB is for further study by RAN.
Therefore, whether the dummy IP packet can be integrity protected and
optionally encrypted by the small data transfer security context depends on
the study outcome of RAN WGs.
7\. This corresponds to step 5 in clause 5.7.4.2.5.
8\. This corresponds to step 6 in clause 5.7.4.2.5.
9\. This corresponds to step 7 in clause 5.7.4.2.5.
10\. The S-GW requests the MME to stop further paging attempts.
11\. This corresponds to step 10 in clause 5.7.4.2.5.
12\. This corresponds to step 11 in clause 5.7.4.2.5.
13\. This corresponds to step 12 in clause 5.7.4.2.5.
14\. This corresponds to step 13 in clause 5.7.4.2.5.
##### 5.7.4.2.7 S-GW relocation
It may be possible that more than one small data transfer security context is
derived from the same base key i.e. the K~ASME~, and these small data transfer
security contexts are sent to different S-GW\'s. An example where this can
occur is if the UE is first sharing a small data transfer security context
with one S-GW and then later there is a change of S-GW. To ensure that the
first S-GW cannot deduce any information about the small data transfer
security context used in the second S-GW and vice versa, the key derivation
function calculating the small data transfer security context should use some
unique input that is unique for each S-GW. Another option is that the same
small data transfer security context is used with all S-GWs.
X2 handover, S1 handover, and TAU may result in SGW relocation, if different
SGWs use different SDT security contexts, new security context need to be
established and synchronizes between UE and the new SGW. Thus UE and SGW need
to exchange security parameters which used to generate new SDT security
context during these three procedures.
\- For TAU, MME can generate new SDT security context and deliver it to target
SGW through message \"create session request\", and MME can also send its
security parameters to UE through message \"TAU accept\". However, UE cannot
report its security parameters to MME through message \"TAU Request\", because
the SGW relocation is determined by MME, so UE can not know whether SGW should
relocate before sending \"TAU Request\". If the generation of new SDT security
context needs parameters from UE, there is the problem that UE cannot report
its necessary security parameters to MME. And the security parameters like
\"uplink NAS count\" and \"downlink NAS count\" have been used already, thus
they cannot be used to generate SDT security context. So SDT security context
may not be synchronized in TAU with SGW relocation.
\- For S1/X2 handover, the UE and the network is not expected to maintain the
radio bearer during the handover. UE will release the radio bearer and
reconnect once the S1/X2 handover is completed at which time a new SDT
security context will be established.
##### 5.7.4.2.8 Switching between small data fast path and regular UP
If the UE or network realizes that it is more beneficial to switch to normal
user plane traffic than using the small data transfer path (or vice versa),
they may switch.
Since the UE and eNB transmits the two traffic types on two different bearers,
there is no ambiguity whether it is a small data transfer or a regular user
plane connection. Therefore the UE can use the normal LTE AS security to
protect any data sent over the normal user plane data radio bearer and only
apply the new small data transfer protection if the small data is transmitted
over the (otherwise unprotected) data radio bearer used for small data
transfer.
When the switches appear, there needs to be an indication sent to the UE from
the network, so that the UE will know to re-configure itself for the new data
radio bearer and switch to the other security context.
When the switches appear, there needs to be an indication sent from the MME to
the S-GW, so that the S-GW will know to re-configure itself when to apply
small data security to the small data traffic.
#### 5.7.4.3 Connectionless Data Transmission solution
##### 5.7.4.3.0 General
SA2 solution currently considered in SA2 TR 23.887 V0.8.0 [26], clause
5.1.1.3.6.3 (Connectionless data transmission, Alternative B) is based on the
principle that small occasional data bursts are sent while the UE is in the
Idle mode. The RRC connection is established for this transmission, but the S1
MME connection is not. Also, the connections over S1-U/S12 tunnels are
predefined at bearer set up time, and maintained via Mobility management
procedures (i.e. when SGW relocation happens). The S1-U/S12 UL tunnels are
unique per UE and bearer for a given SGW. This eliminates the need to re-
establish these tunnels per UE for each short data transmission in the idle
mode. This mode of operation is called here the Connectionless mode.
The intention with the Connectionless data transmission solution is that small
data can be sent in user plane when the UE is in idle mode without requiring
the normal transition to connected mode in AS-layer in LTE systems. As stated
in SA2 TR 23.887 clause 5.1.1.3.6.3.1 [26], the mobility is not required in
connectionless mode. Conventionally, this data would be sent either without
any AS security, or full AS security re-configuration needs to be executed,
including NAS signalling, in order to re-establish AS security. Former would
result in vulnerability of small data to eavesdropping, injection, and
interception, while latter would be prohibitively complex.
Efficient solution is hence needed to re-establish the AS security protection
of the small data traffic with reduced signalling overhead, e.g. without the
need for a NAS signaling with the MME/SGSN at every re-connection.
The security solution described below re-uses cached security context at the
UE and the eNB/RNC rather than re-creating it at every RRC connection
instance. Solution involves the usage of a \'Token\' for the fast
identification of the UE context.
##### 5.7.4.3.1 UE Initial Access and Token Allocation
When the \'MTC Connectionless\' device uses an eNB/RNC area for the first time
to send or receive data on a connectionless bearer, it issues a service
request with an indication it is for connectionless service. Security
procedures run as defined in Rel.11 (involving the MME, the ENB and the UE per
Rel 11 TS 33.401 [13], e.g. the MME determines a K~eNB~ and communicates it to
the serving eNB via S1-AP, involving the SGSN, the RNC and the UE per Rel 11TS
33.102 [12]) with the addition of following mechanisms:
\- The MME returns to the eNB a UE-specific cookie that is uniquely associated
with the permanent UE Identity (IMSI) along with the K~eNB~. This cookie
allows the eNB to recognize the potential duplicate cached context for the
same UE. The cookie should be unique within the network without revealing the
true UE identity.
\- The new eNB/RNC allocates a \'Token\' to indicate the UE security context
associated with that eNB. The Token is integrity protected by the established
security association. The security context is cached in both the eNB/RNC and
UE, while the Token acts as an index to this context. The Token is considered
valid for the duration of its life time assigned by the eNB/RNC. The Token,
its assigned lifetime, and its associated context have significance within the
eNB/RNC that assigns it.
\- The UE is expected to retain a context and associated Token for each
eNB/RNC it visits and communicates with during the lifetime of the Token.
\- The eNB/RNC is expected to retain a context and associated Token for each
UE that visits it and communicates with it during the lifetime of the Token
assigned by this eNB/RNC.
\- When the UE moves to a new eNB/RNC where the UE and eNB/RNC do not have
context cached, the new eNB/RNC allocates a new \'Token\' to indicate the UE
security context associated with the new eNB/RNC.
The process of Token Allocation during the initial access is shown on figure
5.7.4.3.1-1.
Figure 5.7.4.3.1-1: Initial Access and Token Allocation
Insteps 1-6,the UE initially accesses the new eNB. This is a regular access
call flow using the NAS Service Request procedure. In step 5, HSS gives
subscription information of UE which includes Connectionless capability to
MME. In step 6, Along with security context, the MME also delivers the cookie
to the eNB and Token lifetime indication. In step 7 the eNB allocates the
Token for the established security context and delivers it to the UE In the
RRC Security Mode Command. Steps 7-9, and all subsequent interactions are
protected by AS security in Connected state, until UE transitions to Idle
state. Transition to Idle state happens after the data transmission is
completed.
The figure 5.7.4.3.1-2 shows subsequent access to a new eNB when security
context already exists at the MME, and AKA authentication is skipped.
Figure 5.7.4.3.1-2: UE Subsequent Access to MME with K~ASME~ (no AKA)
Similarly to the process shown in figure 5.7.4.3.1-1, in step 6 the MME
returns the security context as well as the cookie, and in step 7 the eNB
allocates the Token to this security context.
##### 5.7.4.3.2 Use of a Token for Subsequent Network Access
For subsequent access in connectionless mode to the eNB/RNC with which the UE
has a cached context and a valid Token, once the UE recognizes the eNB/RNC
from the id it broadcasts, the UE uses this Token to re-initiate the security
context.
The unique eNB identity within PLMN is explicitly included in the E-UTRAN
broadcast (CI in the SIB1).
In UTRAN the RNC identity is not explicit, and as imbedded in the 28-bit
CellID, may be between 12 and 16 bits. In a simplified case, the Token will be
assigned per CellID resulting in multiple Tokens leading to the same context.
Optimizations are possible if the UE can better identify specific RNC that
holds the context.
UE continues PDCP Counters used for ciphering and integrity protection as per
the Token context applicable to the eNB/RNC.
UE sends the Token to eNB/RNC in the RRC Connection Request procedure to do a
fast establishment of the DRBs and SRBs needed for the intended service. From
the eNB/RNC viewpoint, once the context is found, the session is restored as
if the UE never left this eNB/RNC.
The Token included in the Connection Request procedure is integrity protected
using the respective RRC security association (Integrity Protected using
K~RRCInt~), to allow one step validation and replay protection.
When the ENB/RNC has validated the Token and retrieved the corresponding
context, the ENB/RNC does not need to contact the MME/SGSN to provide service
to the UE.
An UE that wants to exchange NAS signalling (e.g. to activate a PDN
connection) uses normal connected mode operation, not connectionless mode
operation. The process of Token use for subsequent accesses is shown on figure
5.7.4.3.3-1.
{width="5.346527777777778in" height="5.116666666666666in"}
Figure 5.7.4.3.2-1: Use of Token for subsequent access.
In message 3 \"Connection Setup Complete\" UE includes the Connection ID
allocated for small data, and the Token associated with the security context
established during initial attach. This and all subsequent messages and data
are protected by AS security associated with the Token.
##### 5.7.4.3.2.1 AS security context separation and coexistence. {#as-
security-context-separation-and-coexistence. .H6}
Connection-oriented and connectionless sessions will not run simultaneously.
If during the regular data session in connected state the application needs to
send a small data, it will be sent through a normal data channel on already
allocated bearer. Conventional AS security created for the connection-oriented
session will be used to secure the short data. Additionally, per clause
5.7.4.3.1 UE Initial Access and Token Allocation, the eNB will cache the
security context and generate a Token for future connectionless mode sessions.
If during the connection state a handover is performed to a eNB with a cached
security context, the cached security context (if exists) is left untouched
and unused in connected state.
Similarly, if the connectionless mode is established for sending the small
data, then regular data session will not be established concurrently.
Transitions from connectionless to a connection-oriented mode or vice versa
during the data transmission session are not expected.
##### 5.7.4.3.2.2 Duplicate Cached Context Recognition {#duplicate-cached-
context-recognition .H6}
The eNB may recognize during connection-oriented session establishment that
there is already a valid security context and a Token cached for this UE. The
recognition would be possible because the cached context is linked to the
UE‑specific cookie returned by the MME during the session establishment.
Recognition of a duplicate cached context is achieved as follows:
When the AS security context is received from the MME, the eNB will search its
cache for a stored context associated with the cookie for the UE, and if
found, the eNB can declare the duplicate context.
Once the duplicate context is declared, the eNB replaces the existing cached
context with the new one, and assigns a new Token to it. The old context and
Token are purged.
##### 5.7.4.3.3 Cached Context Invalidation and Deletion
The contexts and the Tokens in the UE get deleted in the UE when it detaches
from the network.
The contexts and the Tokens are also deleted due to aging, when associated
lifetime expires.
The context and the Token are deleted in the UE when the value of PDCP Counter
approaches locally preset maximum limit, to avoid roll over. Subsequent access
to the same eNB/RNC will proceed without Token, and new context will be
derived.
If new AKA authentication is executed, and new K~ASME~ (or CK/IK) is derived,
all existing cached Tokens and contexts in the UE are deleted. The new Token
is assigned for the current new context.
If UE returns to the eNB/RNC with no Token indication, even if eNB/RNC has the
valid cached context and valid Token with this UE, the eNB/RNC will delete
existing Token for this UE, treat the access as an initial entry, and assign
the new Token.
If the eNB receives the security context from the MME to be used for
connectionless mode for the UE, and eNB finds already cached valid context for
this UE/cookie, the eNB invalidates the old security context and Token,
replaces it with the new security context, and assigns the new Token.
If UE returns to the eNB/RNC with a Token but the eNB/RNC has no valid cached
context associated with this valid Token, the eNB/RNC will reject the access
attempt and require the UE to execute a full service request procedure as if
this was a new eNB/RNC for the UE.
##### 5.7.4.3.4 Token Lifetime Management.
Different MTC applications may have different activity times and hence the
Token Lifetime needed for the devices may differ from device to device.
A uniform allocation of the Token Lifetime for all MTC devices is a simple
option for eNB implementation. However, if the Token runs out too soon
compared to the MTC device activity, it would need to go through the initial
access procedure every time, which is not optimal. Similarly, if the Token
Lifetime is too long, storage resources in the UE and eNB may become
overloaded for no reason, which is not optimal either.
Another option could be an allocation based on the subscription details coming
from HSS to MME/SGSN and to eNB/RNC. At the initial access, the IMSI of the
device may be correlated with requirements of its subscription applications,
and Token lifetime allocation may correspond to these application
requirements. This option will need standardization effort.
Some intelligent eNB/RNC implementations may adapt the Token Lifetime
allocation to the observed periodicity of UE activity.
Hence there are different considerations for Token lifetime allocation.
Token lifetime allocation need to be sensitive to the nature of MTCe device
application and the frequency of data exchange.
For example for once a month metering device where one or two packets of meter
reading data are sent by the device it may not make sense to keep a cached
context in the eNB. Conventional connected mode operation may be sufficient.
Whereas for an MTCe device which sends a sensor data once an hour it might
make sense to keep its context cached in the eNB for at least a couple of
hours, and allow a Connectionless transmission protected with a cached
context.
Hence for Connectionless devices, the application-specific frequency of
transmission correlated with practical Token lifetime may be a part of the
subscription information transferred to MME to fine tune the Token allocation
and context retention.
Token life time indication is send from MME to eNB as part of the Initial
Context setup message. MME makes this determination based on the subscription
data.
##### 5.7.4.3.5 Threat scenarios
##### 5.7.4.3.5.1 A \"Stolen Token\" scenario: {#a-stolen-token-scenario .H6}
Since Token is sent by the UE in the clear, it could be eavesdropped on by the
attacker. Subsequently, the attacker may try to replay the same Token in its
own access. However, because the attacker will not have a security context
associated with the Token, he will not be able to apply a proper integrity
protection to the Token. Integrity Validation of the Token will fail at the
eNB, presented value of the Token will be ignored, connectionless access
request will be rejected. Therefore, there is no benefit to the attacker to
steal the Token.
##### 5.7.4.3.5.2 eNB Resource exhaustion attack by a malicious UE {#enb-
resource-exhaustion-attack-by-a-malicious-ue .H6}
To explore resource exhaustion (i.e. cached context), the malicious UE may
continually access the eNB with the connectionless indication but without the
Token, even though the eNB already cached a valid context and Token for this
UE. The potential resource exhaustion on eNB is addressed by identifying the
duplicate context for the same UE. This is accomplished by sending the UE
-specific cookie by the MME to the eNB. The cookie is cached along with the
context, and when the new context is received from the MME, the eNB can search
for the duplicate context associated with the same UE/cookie. The old
duplicate context will be replaced with the new context and a new Token will
be assigned. As this request can be entertained only if the UE issuing it
properly authenticates, the malicious UE will not be able to invalidate the
context associated with any other UE. Therefore there is no benefit to the
attacker to plant the resource exhaustion attack.
In other way to explore resource exhaustion, the malicious UE may access
multiple eNBs with the connectionless indication but without the Token, thus
leading each eNB to creating the cached security context with the Token that
will not be used. This created in vain security context will be purged upon
its lifetime expiration, and will present a small fraction of overhead in
utilization of memory resources for the eNB, as allocated to a single memory
cache for a single malicious UE.
##### 5.7.4.3.5.3 Forging of small data transmission by obtaining cached
security context from a compromised eNB while the cached security context is
still valid. {#forging-of-small-data-transmission-by-obtaining-cached-
security-context-from-a-compromised-enb-while-the-cached-security-context-is-
still-valid. .H6}
The compromised eNB will receive from the MME a necessary security association
-- the K~eNB~ -- that will enable it to forge data transmission for all
sessions - connectionless and connection-oriented. There is no benefit to
target only cached context, if a fresh context can be simply received for
every session. Moreover, the forged small data can be delivered into the S1U
without regard to any AS security, whether cached or not. Therefore, danger of
eNB compromise remains critical for small data as well as normal data
sessions, and is not different from that addressed in a current security
framework.
##### 5.7.4.3.5.4 Retroactive decryption of past data by obtaining the cached
security context from a compromised eNB while the cached security context is
still valid. {#retroactive-decryption-of-past-data-by-obtaining-the-cached-
security-context-from-a-compromised-enb-while-the-cached-security-context-is-
still-valid. .H6}
The attacker may gain access to the eNB during the off-hours, when eNB is not
monitored for an unauthorized access and therefore is more vulnerable. Proper
Token lifetime management policies can ensure that cached context is deleted
during these hours of higher vulnerability. The context used for protecting
the short data during hours of higher vulnerability should be time-limited,
possibly limited to individual short data transmission session or few
sessions, and should be deleted after these set limits are over. During the
normal business hours, when access to the eNB is normally monitored, the
connectionless context lifetime management can be restored again to its normal
policy values. Re‑establishing the connectionless context in such a scenario
may have additional processing if large number of UEs are involved.
If an eNB is permanently vulnerable to a compromise, the Connectionless
feature could be disabled from such an eNB.
##### 5.7.4.3.5.5 Potentially increased risk of key compromise in the eNB due
to retaining the AS security context. {#potentially-increased-risk-of-key-
compromise-in-the-enb-due-to-retaining-the-as-security-context. .H6}
Retained AS security context can be used over extensive period of time for
securing a large number of small data transmissions. However, it does not
present a different potential for cryptanalysis than when the same AS security
context is used for securing a large data transmission over the single session
for a comparable amount of data. The validity of security context is currently
limited by the size of the PDCP counter, which is used as the crypto-sync. The
same limitation is observed for the connectionless mode to limit the amount of
data exchanged during a validity period of the cached security context.
Therefore, there is no additional risk of key compromise in the eNB due to
retaining the AS security context.
Key vulnerability due to caching: The cached AS security context is available
in the eNB. This increases the time an attacker can spend on cryptanalyzing
traffic sent between the UE and the eNB, resulting in that the attacker gets
they encryption key. The attacker can then decrypt new traffic sent at a later
time using the cached AS security context. However, there is no reason to
believe that it is feasible to break the currently used security algorithms.
Moreover as discussed in clause 5.7.4.3.4 context caching need to be sensitive
to the nature of MTCe application and the frequency of data exchange. The
application sensitive context caching at eNB, helps eNB to fine tune the
caching specific to individual UEs. This means that it is possible to have
some control over how long time the AS security context is available in the
eNB. Further periodic refresh of cached context at eNB can be implemented as a
policy to re‑fresh of context oblivious to UE procedures.
##### 5.7.4.3.5.6 Potentially increased risk to UE Identity Confidentiality in
eNB. {#potentially-increased-risk-to-ue-identity-confidentiality-in-enb. .H6}
Unlike in current operation, when the eNB does not recognize identity of the
UE, the connectionless security scheme proposes to send the UE-specific cookie
from the MME to the eNB to assist in recognizing duplicate cached context.
Identity Confidentiality is preserved since a cookie is generated instead of
sending the UE identity to the eNB.
#### 5.7.4.4 MTC-IWF based Secure Solution for Small data transmission
##### 5.7.4.4.1 Background and requirements
SA3 studies small data transmission (SDT) security where the issue of concern
is in-frequent transmission of SD while UE is in RRC-IDLE state because that
is when AS security context does not exist. This is also visible in SA2
solutions (TS 23.887 clauses 5.1.1.3.1 and 5.1.1.3.2 [26]). As many such UEs
can exist, establishment of AS and/or NAS security will increase signalling
and have negative impact on network as well as UE resources. Therefore it is
required to minimize signalling traffic (TS 22.368 [9] clause 7.2.5 and TS
23.887 clause 5.1.1.2 [26]).
##### 5.7.4.4.2 Potential solutions
As AS security is out of question to secure SDT the security in core network
can end at:
(i) MME with NAS security,
(ii) MTC-IWF; or
(iii) some other network element like SGW.
Any solution should provide adequate security while having minimal impact on
the current system architecture; this valid for both SDT and DT.
So as to minimize impact on network, reduce resource usage and minimize system
architecture impact a solution with MTC-IWF as the end-point for security in
the network is proposed. With MTC-IWF as security end-point in the network,
security of SD and DT communication can be provided even when AS and/or NAS
security context are not available.
##### 5.7.4.4.3 Solution overview
The solution consists of:
1) Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA). During this procedure, HSS derives
a master key K_iwf and sends it to MTC-IWF.
2) Keys negotiation and establishment using a new Security Mode Command (SMC)
procedure carried between UE and MTC-IWF -- this new procedure can ride on NAS
SMC. As a result of this procedure, UE and MTC-IWF share the same K_iwf and
subkeys for confidentiality and integrity protection.
3) SD (both mobile originated, MO, and mobile terminated, MT) and trigger
transmission: the transmission can ride on packets that do not need NAS
security as per current specification, with recognition of such data is being
carried, NAS security can be omitted. In the following clause detailed
solution is proposed.
Editor\'s Note: The impact to MME is FFS when terminating the security in the
IWF and MME receives unprotected NAS message carrying small data.
Editor\'s Note: Details including confidentiality and integrity protection of
the security protocols between the UE and the MTC-IWF should be given.
##### 5.7.4.4.4 Detailed Solution
##### 5.7.4.4.4.0 General {#general-16 .H6}
In this clause, solution detail covering key derivation and negotiation,
security mode command, and small data transmission and delivery is discussed.
Solution evaluation is given at the end of the clause.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.1 Key Derivation and negotiation {#key-derivation-and-
negotiation .H6}
We propose a new key hierarchy shared between UE and MTC-IWF. This new key
hierarchy contains a master key K_iwf, and a pair of subkeys (for
confidentiality and integrity protection separately) derived from K_iwf. The
message sequence of how the K_iwf and subkeys are derived in network during
Attach procedure is depicted in figure 5.7.4.4.4.1-1 and discussed below.
{width="5.942361111111111in" height="4.0152777777777775in"}
Figure 5.7.4.4.4.1-1: Key derivation in Attach Procedure
1\. UE sends Attach Request, contains IMSI and UE capability of MTC
communication and sending/receiving Small Data.
2\. MME sends Authentication data request to HSS.
3\. HSS derives K_iwf from Kasme (in case of E-UTRAN).
4\. HSS sends Authentication data response to MME
5\. HSS sends MTC-IWF the UE capabilities and K_iwf in a new message for
example Update Subscriber Information
6\. MME sends Authentication Request to UE
7\. UE sends MME the Authentication Response.
Note: Step 2, 3, 5, and 6 follow the normal Authentication procedure.
8\. MME verifies whether UE is a MTC device and is allowed to send/receive
Small Data, according to the information it retrieved from HSS.
9\. At MTC-IWF, K_iwf is stored and subkeyes are derived.
10\. A new IWF SMC procedure is proposed, which is carried in NAS SMC. After
the procedure, UE shares the same K_iwf and subkeys with MTC-IWF. The detail
of IWF SMC procedure is depicted in figure 2.
11\. MME sends Attach Accept to UE.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.2 Security Mode Command {#security-mode-command .H6}
In this clause, Step 9 in figure 5.7.4.4.4.1-1 of IWF SMC carried in NAS SMC
procedure is discussed. During the procedure, MTC-IWF can inform UE the
algorithm for key derivation. UE and MTC-IWF can perform integrity check with
the integrity subkey. After IWF SMC procedure, UE and MTC-IWF will share the
K_iwf and subkeys. The details are given in figure 5.7.4.4.4.2-1.
{width="4.332638888888889in" height="5.129861111111111in"}
Figure 5.7.4.4.4.2-1: IWF SMC procedure carried in NAS SMC
1\. MTC-IWF sends integrity protected IWF SMC message or the necessary
parameters for UE to perform key derivation, with UE ID to MME.
2\. MME carries the IWF SMC message with NAS Security Mode Command message and
sends it to UE.
3\. UE performs NAS integrity verification.
4\. If NAS integrity verification fails, UE sends NAS SMC Reject message
carrying IWF SMC Reject message to MME, MME forwards the IWF SMC Reject
message to MTC-IWF.
5\. If NAS integrity verification is successful, UE derives K_iwf and subkeys.
UE uses the Kasme indicated by the eKSI in NAS Security Mode Command.
6\. UE performs integrity verification on the IWF SMC, using the integrity
subkey derived by UE.
7\. UE sends the NAS SMC Complete carrying IWF SMC Complete to MME, IWF SMC
Complete message can be integrity protected.
8\. Or UE sends IWF SMC Reject message carried in NAS SMC Complete, if the
verification in Step 6 fails. Or MME forwards the IWF SMC Complete or IWF SMC
Reject message to MTC-IWF.
9\. MTC-IWF can perform integrity verification on the IWF SMC Complete
message.
10\. Security association is established between UE and MTC-IWF and they can
start secure communication. If MTC-IWF received IWF SMC Complete, and
integrity verification is passed at Step 9 (when it is carried).
If a NAS SMC procedure is carried following a normal AKA in initial
procedures, MME can know that whether UE already has Kasme, whether UE
Capability allows itself to derive K_iwf (for example, if UE subscribes MTC
service, if UE subscribes SDT service). A timer can be set in MME to wait for
IWF SMC from MTC-IWF.
1\. Before the timer expires, MME waits for the IWF SMC to start NAS SMC
procedure.
2\. If MME does not receive IWF SMC from MTC-IWF, and the timer is expired,
MME will perform a normal NAS SMC to UE.
3\. If MME receives IWF SMC from MTC-IWF when the timer is already expired,
MME can run an empty NAS SMC only for carrying the IWF SMC procedure.
4\. When MTC-IWF decides to update K_iwf and sends MME the IWF SMC, MME will
perform an empty NAS SMC to carry the IWF SMC.
5\. The timer: the timer can be started when MME received Authentication
Response from UE. The timer can be stopped when it is expired or when IWF SMC
is received from MTC-IWF.
6\. The IWF-SMC procedure: it is independent from other NAS procedures. MTC-
IWF can decide when to send it. During initial procedure, if MTC-IWF sends the
IWF SMC before timer in MME expired, the IWF SMC and NAS SMC can be combined;
if not, they can be separated.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.3 Small data and device trigger communication {#small-data-
and-device-trigger-communication .H6}
##### 5.7.4.4.4.3.0 General {#general-17 .H6}
We consider the procedure can be the same for MTC device trigger and Small
Data MT transmission. It is assumed that MTC-IWF has UE serving node
information. If not, it can retrieve the information upon receiving Device
Trigger/Small Data Submission Request, by sending Subscriber Information
Request to HSS, and receives a Subscriber Information Response from HSS that
contains the serving node information.
Note: As per the present document small data should be integrity protected and
maybe confidentiality protected.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.3.1 MT small data when UE is IDLE {#mt-small-data-when-ue-is-
idle .H6}
This clause presents secure MT small data transmission when UE is idle. It can
also apply to device trigger. MTC-IWF upon receiving the small data or trigger
will perform SCS authorization and submit it to MME. Paging procedure is used
for the SD or DT delivery. The detail is depicted in figure 5.7.4.4.4.3.1-1
given below.

5.7.4.4.4.3.1-1. MT Small Data Transmission
1\. SCS sends Small Data Submission Request to MTC-IWF.
2\. MTC-IWF performs SCS and UE authorization, to see if SCS can send Small
Data and if UE can receive Small Data.
3\. MTC-IWF submits the Small Data to MME, with UE ID, message type as small
data, integrity protection with integrity subkey (IWF-MAC), and
confidentiality protection with confidentiality subkey if needed.
4\. MME sends to eNB the Small Data in Request Paging message, contains
S-TMSI, message type as small data, and IWF-MAC.
5\. eNB sends to UE the Small Data in Paging message.
6\. Upon receiving, UE can skip NAS and AS integrity check, if the message
type is small data.
7\. UE performs IWF integrity check, with the integrity subkey.
8\. Normal RRC Connection Request is sent from UE to eNB.
9\. Normal RRC Connection Setup is sent from eNB to UE.
10\. The Small Data Receive confirm can be sent in RRC Connection setup
complete or sent in Service Request to eNB.
11\. Submit Small data confirm can be sent from eNBMMEMTC-IWF.
Editor\'s note: It is not right to broadcast SD/DT packets belonging to one UE
to all UEs in the whole tracking area. In addition, paging message cannot
carry data packets and if it has to carry, the message needs to expanded,
which leads to wastage of network resources. Expanding the paging message may
also have other backward compatibility implications. Alternate messages need
to be used to deliver SD/DT to Idle mode UEs.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.3.2 MO small data when UE is IDLE {#mo-small-data-when-ue-is-
idle .H6}
This clause presents secure MO small data transmission when UE is idle. It
requires MME to store the routing information for UE, such that UE does not
need to contain MTC-IWF identifier in the Small Data. The detail is depicted
in figure 5.7.4.4.4.3.2-1 given below
{width="6.685416666666667in" height="2.5006944444444446in"}

1\. UE uses the subkeys to integrity and confidentiality (if necessary)
protect the Small Data.
2\. UE sends Small Data in Service Request to MME, with SCS ID.
3\. MME can skip NAS integrity check, if the message type is small data.
4\. MME retrieves the routing for UE and finds out to which MTC-IWF the Small
Data should be sent.
5\. MME forwards the Small Data to MTC-IWF.
6\. MTC-IWF performs integrity check with its subkey and performs UE
authorization, to see if the UE is allowed to send Small Data towards the

7\. MTC-IWF can also detect if there are too many small data being sent to the
same SCS.
8\. If the verifications in Step 6 and 7 are successful, MTC-IWF delivers the
Small Data to SCS.
9\. If the verifications in Step 6 and 7 failed, MTC-IWF can inform MME/eNB by
sending Small Data Reject message, such that eNB and MME can block
communication from the given UE and/or to the given SCS.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.3.3 Small data and device trigger when UE is CONNECTED
{#small-data-and-device-trigger-when-ue-is-connected .H6}
We consider the procedure can be the same for MTC device trigger and Small
Data MT transmission when UE is CONNECTED. The SD or DT can be protected with
subkeys and carried in NAS message of DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT. This is
to show that the proposed solution can be applied to UE in CONNECTED. The
details are depicted in figure 5.7.4.4.4.3.3-1 given below.

7\. MTC-IWF sends the Submit confirm to SCS.
Editor\'s Note: The description of this clause may not server the purpose of
section 5.7. It needs FFS.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.4 Protocol between UE and MTC-IWF {#protocol-between-ue-and-
mtc-iwf .H6}
The IWF protocol is between NAS and application layer protocol for MTC, it
spans between UE and MTC-IWF and can be transparent to MME/SGSN/MSC. For the
protocol between MME and MTC-IWF, the T5-AP defined in clause 5.1.1.3.3, TR
23.887 [26] can be used.
Figure 5.7.4.4.4.4-1 below illustrates the protocol stack.
{width="5.5625in" height="2.847916666666667in"}
Figure 5.7.4.4.4.4-1: Protocol stack between UE and MTC-IWF
The protocol between UE and MTC-IWF can be based on PDCP. PDCP provides
ciphering, deciphering, integrity protection and integrity verification (as
defined in TS 36.323 [44]) which can be re-used. MTC-IWF can be configured
with the same algorithms as in UE.
Editor\'s Note: It needs to clarify how MTC-IWF communicates with UE by PDCP
protocol as there is no PDCP protocol in MTC-IWF.
Figure 5.7.4.4.4.4-2 shows the packet format for SD that is based on the
format defined in TS 36.323.
{width="2.8194444444444446in" height="2.109722222222222in"}
Figure 5.7.4.4.4.4-2: Packet format
SN can be used to prevent replay attack. KSI is a key identifier of subkeys
for UE and MTC-IWF to determine the key to be used for small data transmission
protection. MAC-I is computed by the integrity subkey.
##### 5.7.4.4.4.5 Normal small data consideration {#normal-small-data-
consideration .H6}
We assume that:
a) Normal data can be sent through MTC-IWF or SGW, and this clause only
presents the case when it is sent through MTC-IWF.
b) Normal procedures means the data is not small data.
c) Normal data can only be sent when UE is CONNECTED and the NAS and AS
security are activated:
1) In case of MTC-IWF, our solution can be used with improvement.
For Downlink, MTC-IWF receives normal Data Submission Request from SCS, it
performs data size check, authorization and protection. Normal data should not
be delivered to UE in idle. NAS and AS security can be optional or mandatory
depends on the agreement between UE and network.
For Uplink, when UE sends normal data, MME can perform normal/small data
check. There should be requirements on when and how normal data can be sent.
For example: normal data can only be sent when UE is connected. NAS and AS
security can be optional or mandatory depends on the agreement between UE and
network.
1) In case of SGW, current procedure is followed.
#### 5.7.4.5 Connectionless Data Transmission Solution Using Separate Security
Context
##### 5.7.4.5.1 General
In order to achieve acceptable level of security and low complexity in
handling the security context, a separate security key to be used for
connectionless data transmission. The reasons being:
\- Effective PDCP COUNT handling
\- Current specification resets the PDCP COUNT, during state transitions. With
the solution under study (see clause 5.7.4.3), PDCP COUNT to be maintained
along with the AS security context and it is continued even when the UE comes
back to the same cell and also when the UE moves from connection oriented mode
to connectionless mode of operation. This will lead to HFN de-synchronization
issues and complex PDCP COUNT handling in the UE and also in the eNB.
\- To be in line with the existing PDCP COUNT handling mechanisms and to
reduce complexity, a separate security key to be used for connectionless data
transmission, so that PDCP COUNT can be reset to \"0\" during state
transitions.
\- Potentially increased risk of key compromise in the eNB due to retaining
the AS security context for long time.
\- Solution under study (see clause 5.7.4.3) uses the same AS security context
for both connection oriented and connectionless mode of operations, the risk
from key compromise is high since the same keys are cached and used for long
time for both modes. Also if the key is compromised, then the attack duration
is long. The key compromise happens over the air interface is assumed.
\- Whereas in case of separate security key for connectionless data
transmission, since different keys are used, life time/usage of the key is
less (key refresh happens whenever there is state transition and also whenever
there is cell change), so the risk is minimized. The proposed solution
refreshes the key without performing the service request procedure.
\- Resource exhaustion attack on eNBs:
\- As the MME is not aware of whether the key will be used for connectionless
or connection oriented transmission, there is possibility of resource
exhaustion attack on eNBs by a malicious UE creating security contexts in
several eNBs.
\- If the MME is involved in the connectionless data transmission key
derivation, then the MME can control the number of keys established for the UE
for the connectionless transmission and may also delete the security context
in the eNB, if the MME identifies UE\'s cell change or make UE to move to
connection oriented mode as UE request key frequently for connectionless
operation or reduce the lifetime of the key, as key request for connectionless
operation is frequent.
\- Preventing the attacks being carried out between Idle and Connected modes:
\- If the connected mode operation key is compromised, then this should not
lead to continue the attack in the connectionless operation.
\- To be in line with the compartmentalization security principle, the key
used for connectionless data transmission to be cryptographically different
with the key used in connected mode. This is achieved using separate key for
connectionless transmission.
\- Support for cell change without performing service request procedure:
\- It would be advantages to get the security context in place for the
connectionless without performing the complete service request procedure.
\- No concurrent Connectionless and Connection oriented mode of operation at
any one time:
\- As SA2 decided that \"Multiple PDN connections can be supported
concurrently. However all PDN connections are handled in Connectionless or
Connection oriented mode at any one time.\". This is in favour of using
separate security context for connectionless mode to enhance the level of
security.
##### 5.7.4.5.2 Separate Security Context Mechanism
The security solution described below use separate key K~CLT~ at the UE and
the eNB for connectionless transmission rather than caching and using the keys
used in connected mode. In case of LTE, the protection is be provided by the
PDCP layer between UE and eNB. The UE and the MME derives the key K~CLT~ .
When requested by eNB, MME derives and passes the K~CLT~ for the AS security
protection (especially user traffic protection). The separate AS security
protection of the small data traffic is established for the first small data
packet, when the UE is in idle mode and use the established context for the
rest small data transmission in the same cell and till the life time of the
key. When the UE moves to connected mode, the security context established for
the small data traffic is deleted and the UE follow the existing procedure for
establishing the AS security context. The small data packets are secured by
the UE and the eNB by encrypting the data packets and/or applying the
integrity protection with keys derived from the key K~CLT~ and using the
selected cryptographic algorithms for the connectionless data transmission.
The cryptographic algorithms selected during AS SMC procedure for connected
mode protection can be used for connectionless data protection. When there is
a cell change or state transition to idle, PDCP COUNT for small data are reset
to 0 and the key K~CTL~ is refreshed.
##### 5.7.4.5.3 Key Derivation
The MME and the UE derives the new security key K~CLT~ using MME nonce and the
K~ASME~ for connectionless transmission mode. The K~CLT~ derivation using MME
nonce is given below:
K~CLT~ = KDF {K~ASME~, NONCE~MME-CLT~}
MME nonce is used to generate unique key per request. K~CLT-int~ and K~CLT-
enc~ are derived in the UE and in the eNB.
The derivation of K~CLT-int~ and K~CLT-enc~ are as follows:
K~CLT-int~ = KDF {K~CLT~, Int Alg-ID, CLT-int-alg}
K~CLT-enc~ = KDF {K~CLT~, Enc Alg-ID, CLT-enc-alg}
##### 5.7.4.5.4 Security Procedure:
Figure 5.7.4.5.4-1: Connectionless Data Transmission Solution Using Separate
Security Context
The following steps are performed as described in the signalling flow above:
1\. The UE initiates an attach procedure with an MME and provides its security
capability for connectionless data transmission protection to the MME. The MME
optionally authenticates the UE and a K~ASME~ is established. The MME
generates the NONCE~MME-CLT~ and pass it to the UE. The NONCE~MME-CLT~ and its
lifetime is passed to the UE through the AS SMC procedure. The MME stores the
NONCE~MME-CLT.~
The MME use the NONCE~MME-CLT~ only once and for every further request for
K~CLT,~ it will generate new NONCE~MME-CLT~ to make K~CLT~ unique per request.
2\. If there is no data to transmit, the UE moves in to idle mode.
3\. When the UE is in idle, small data to be transmitted using connectionless
data transmission, the following procedure is followed;
4\. The UE derives the K~CLT~ using the NONCE~MME-CLT~ and further keys for
protecting the small data (as detailed in the above clause 2.2.1). The UE sets
the PDCP COUNT to \'0\" and protects the small data (encrypted and/or
Integrity protected). Small data protection is be provided by the PDCP layer.
The cryptographic algorithms to be used with small data protection are the
same, selected during AS SMC procedure initially.
5\. After applying security, the UE transmits the protected (encrypted and/or
Integrity protected) packet to the eNB. The first small data packet to the eNB
carries eKSI as to ensure the key to be used are same. The small data packet
includes UE-ID (S-TMSI).
6\. If there is no valid keys for the UE in the eNB, the eNB request the MME
for the key K~CLT\ .~ The eNB includes the eKSI and the UE ID along with the
request.
7\. After receiving the request, the MME derives the Key K~CLT~, as detailed
in the above clause 2.2.1.
8\. **The MME responds with the key K~CLT~ and its lifetime to the eNB.**
**9\. The eNB stores the key K~CLT,~ its life time and starts the timer. The
eNB derives further keys to perform the security check (integrity check and/or
decryption). The eNB remembers the** cryptographic algorithms selected during
AS SMC procedure initially. If needed eNB performs AS SMC procedure for the
connectionless security context establishment.
**10\. After successful integrity verification and/or decryption, the eNB
process the small data packet as detailed in the TR 23.887 (clause**
5.1.1.3.6.3**) [26].**
**11 - 14. The UE and the eNB maintain the key K~CLT~ till its life time and
continue the PDCP COUNT for small data transmissions.**
**15\. If PDCP COUNT wrap-around about to happen or the UE performs cell
reselection, the following procedure will be performed;**
**16\. The UE request for K~CLT~ refresh. The refresh request includes the UE
ID and eKSI.**
**17\. After receiving the K~CLT~ refresh request, the eNB request the MME to
refresh the keys.**
**18\. The MME generates new** NONCE~MME-CLT~ and derives new K~CLT.~
**19\. The MME passes the new K~CLT,~ the** NONCE~MME-CLT~ and lifetime to
**the eNB.**
**20\. The eNB stores the new key from the MME with validity time and**
further keys for protecting the small data. The eNB **sends the** NONCE~MME-
CLT~ **to the UE. If needed eNB performs AS SMC procedure for the
connectionless security context establishment.**
**21.** After receiving the NONCE~MME-CLT~, the UE derives the K~CLT~ and
further keys for protecting the small data. The UE sets the PDCP COUNT to
\'0\"
##### 5.7.4.5.5 Switching from Connectionless to Connected mode
As described in clause 5.7.4.2.7, the procedure is very similar to this
solution also. The UE use the normal LTE AS security to protect any data sent
over the normal user plane data radio bearer and only apply the new small data
transfer protection if the small data is transmitted over the (otherwise
unprotected) data radio bearer used for small data transfer.
When the switches appear (either decided by the UE or by the network), there
needs to be an indication sent to the UE from the network or to the network
from the UE, so that the UE, the eNB and the MME will know to re-configure
itself for the new data radio bearer and switch to the other security context.
Whenever the UE and the eNB switches, it will delete the existing keys.
### 5.7.6 Evaluation
#### 5.7.6.1 General
Solution 3 \"Standalone Small Data Service with T5/Tsp and generic NAS
transport\", solution 4 \"Stateless Gateway for cost efficient transmission of
infrequent or frequent small data\", and solution 8 \"Optimized Service
Request procedure for UEs with a single bearer\" in SA2 TR 23.887 [26] don\'t
have security impact.
#### 5.7.6.2 Connectionless Data Transmission Solution
For improved messaging efficiency the Connectionless data solution proposes
the following changes in UE eNB and MME requirements.
Additional UE requirements:
\- UE capable of operating in the Connectionless mode should be able to cache
the security context with associated Token for each eNB/RNC with which it
established security context since last AS authentication, and for which the
Token is assigned. UE should also caches the Cell ID /RNC ID of the cell/RNC
with which it has the connectionless context.
\- UE should also be able to maintain validity of the cached context and its
associated Token, including its lifetime for expiration and purging. The
cached context should be maintained independent of the normal AS security
context associated with the connection-oriented mode.
\- Separation between AS security contexts for connectionless mode and
connection oriented mode, and between multiple cached AS security contexts
shared with different eNBs.
Additional eNB/RNC requirements:
\- eNB/RNC capable of supporting Connectionless mode should be able to cache
security context for each connectionless UE with which it established security
context since last AS authentication.
\- eNB/RNC should be able to assign and maintain a locally unique Token for
each cached security context, and manage its validity including lifetime for
expiration and purging.
\- eNB/RNC should be able to recognize that the cached context already exists
for the UE when UE requests the new context for the connectionless mode of
operation.
Additional MME requirements:
\- The MME should be able to deliver to the eNB the cookie representing the UE
Identifier and a Token life time indicator when delivering the session-related
AS security context to the eNB, in order to assist the eNB in recognition of
the duplicate cached context, and deliver a subscription based indication for
the eNB to allocate an application-specific Token lifetime.
To summarize, increased complexity of the UE, the eNB and the MME are
expected. Caching of Connectionless contexts will consume memory resources at
UE and eNB to provide current level of AS and NAS security. Token lifetime
allocation sensitive to the application needs conserves any disproportionate
consumption of resources.
#### 5.7.6.3 MTC-IWF based Secure Solution for Small data transmission
##### 5.7.6.3.0 General
The solution can be used for MT and MO small data transmission and trigger
delivery. This clause gives the solution benefits and impacts to existing
system.
##### 5.7.6.3.1 Benefits
The solution can provide security for SD and DT communication, even when there
is no AS and NAS security context, meanwhile it can reduce the network
signalling and offload NAS protocol.
This solution fulfils the following security requirements:
1) Small data and trigger protection: authentication, integrity and
confidentiality
2) Small data and trigger protection in case AS and/or NAS security is not
available
The MTC-IWF based solution has the following benefits compared to NAS security
based solution:
\- Prevent attacks from UE or SCS
\- The MME, when it comes to NAS security based small data transmission, does
not have information about SCS, such that it cannot perform authorization on
SCS and the SDs sent from SCS. For the same reason, MME has no knowledge
whether the UE(s) are allowed to send SD to a given SCS, and may blindly
forward the SD and waste network resource.
\- MTC-IWF based solution (clause 5.7.4.4) performs authorization on both UE
and SCS for SDT that can verify:
1) whether SCS is allowed to send SDT to the given UE;
2) whether the UE is allowed to send SDT to the given SCS;
3) whether there is a large number of SDT being sent by a UE or several UEs to
a given SCS, this information can be used by MTC-IWF to inform MME or eNB to
block the communication.
\- Security when there is no pre-established NAS security:
\- When there is no pre-established NAS security available, MME may discard or
reject the SD or initiate establishment of NAS security. If MME discards or
rejects the SD, the SD cannot be delivered to UE or SCS and affect the
availability of MTC. To generate and negotiate NAS security will create more
signaling and overload NAS protocol for only one SDT.
\- The MTC-IWF based solution can provide security protection for SD with the
keys shared between UE and MTC-IWF, such that the SD can be transmitted
securely in time, without invoke extra procedure and signalling.
\- Reduce load to MME:
\- MME and NAS protocol are not designed for MTC communication and service but
the NAS security based solution requires MME to perform encryption,
decryption, integrity protection and integrity check each time a SDT happens.
Considering high traffic needs from SDT sending to and from MTC UEs, the load
to MME and NAS protocol is heavy.
\- MTC-based solution is independent from NAS security protection thus it can
reduce the processing load due to security on MME. The MME should only forward
the SDT to and from MTC-IWF.
In exception case when IWF SMC is carried in the empty NAS SMC the NAS
signalling will increase by one round-trip (SMC messages).
When terminating the security in the IWF without protecting and verification
by the MME:
\- The security association established between UE and MTC-IWF is sufficient
to protect the SDT, if UE can verify whether the MTC-IWF is a network trusted
entity. Only the network authorized MTC-IWF can have the same Kasme that UE
has, and can derive the same K_iwf and subkeys. Thus UE can verify that
whether MTC-IWF is an authorized network element.
\- In MTC-IWF based solution, the MTC-IWF keys protected SDs are carried in
NAS messages. MME has the information of whether the traffic is from/to a
proper MTC-IWF:
1) MME has the mapping of UE and MTC-IWF, such that MME can ensure that the
MTC communication does not go to an unexpected MTC-IWF.
2) MME carries IWF SMC in NAS SMC procedure, it can know whether IWF SMC is
successful or not. This can prevent MME from forwarding SD without any
protection, when NAS security is not available. When the NAS security context
is activated, MME can perform protection and verification as in normal NAS
security. Overload attack on MME is prevented as given in discussion of the
first Editor\'s Note.
##### 5.7.6.3.2 Impacts to existing system
The proposed solution requires support from HSS, MTC-IWF and UE It has the
following impacts:
\- New keys derivation at UE and HSS, new keys handling in UE and MTC-IWF.
\- Needs an indicator of small data / trigger transmission to provide message
type.
\- Change to NAS protocol messages for AKA and SMC.
\- MME needs to verify whether the NAS message carries SD.
##### 5.7.6.3.3 Open issues
The following issues are still open and should be studied in SA3.
\- Details of key handling.
\- Key management in UE mobility.
#### 5.7.6.4 Security Solutions of Small Data Transfer in NAS PDU
\- The security solution 1 provides necessary integrity and confidentiality
protection for small data transfer in NAS PDU, and make optimization on
signalling simultaneously.
\- Lack of security context: Solution 1 can address this issue.
\- When the solutions are applied, the consumption of NAS COUNT will be
increased. But NAS security counter wraparound is not a problem because the
normal NAS COUNT range is about [0, 2^24^-1] mentioned in TS 33.401, clause
9.2.2.2 [13].
Both solution 1 and solution 2 reuse the existing NAS layer security for
protecting uplink small data packets in NAS PDU. For small data encryption,
the additional requirement is the partial ciphering of the initial L3 message
which is currently only integrity protected without encryption. Such partial
ciphering solution has the following impacts on the UE and the MME.
Additional UE requirements:
\- Set new value for \"Security header type\" IE and partially cipher initial
L3 message
Additional MME requirements:
\- Be able to identify whether the initial L3 message is ciphered or not, and
partially decipher the initial L3 message
#### 5.7.6.5 Security Solution of Small Data Fast Path in User Plane
  * Security termination point issue (eNB vs S-GW): From security point of view, the terminating point can be in the eNB or in the S-GW.
  * Additional threat: without RRC security, the threats (eavesdropping attack and modification attack) to the unprotected radio link identity and SGW Bearer Resource ID sent to the eNB are FFS.
  * Additional UE requirements:
\- Support new security capability for small data fast path. This includes
maintaining a small data security context for the lifetime of the fast path
bearer that needs to be kept separate from any other security context.
\- Support new security protocol for small data fast path.
  * Additional SGW requirements:
\- Support security capability for small data fast path. This includes
maintaining a small data security context for the lifetime of the fast path
bearer in addition to the UE context that the S-GW needs to keep for the UE.
\- Support security protocol for small data fast path
  * Additional MME requirements:
\- Negotiate with the UE the cryptographic algorithms to be used by the SGW.
\- Derive small data security key(s) and send to the SGW together with the
selected algorithms.
\- Indicate the UE to derive small data security keys to be shared with the
SGW.
\- Refresh small data security key(s) for the SGW upon Kasme change.
\- All the above MME-UE signalling can be piggy-backed on the corresponding
NAS signalling for K~ASME~ management. The above MME-SGW signalling can be
piggy-backed on existing GTPv2-C. Potentially new procedures need to be added
to GTPv2-C.
The above can be summarized in the following bullets:
1) As already identified above, solution 6a adds a new security protocol which
requires handling of new security functions in the UE and the SGW. Compared to
a system without small data fast path (i.e. a pre-rel-12 system) this is an
increase in complexity of security mechanisms. The complexity also includes
the new interactions for changing between modes.
2) One example of the interaction scenarios is as such: If a UE with an
enabled fast path bearer is firstly camped on a legacy eNB, the small data
will have to be transferred in connected mode in a normal bearer, i.e. the
small data is protected with normal AS security context. When the UE is handed
over to a fast-path-enabled eNB, it is not clarified in TR 23.887 [26] whether
the UE should keep transmitting small data in the existing normal bearer or
the UE should activate the fast path bearer. Hence the un-clarity whether the
normal AS security context or the fast path security context should be used.
Once this is clarified in SA2, SA3 may make further analysis. The solution for
small data defined in TR 23.887 [26] prescribes that small data PDN contexts
are kept after creation during Attach procedure in the SGW and the UE as long
as the fast path remains enabled. The PDN context contains a security context
as a subset. Therefore the PDN context will become larger when security is
added to the solution. It is under discussion whether that is a significant
increase in size of the PDN context or not. Regardless if the fast path is
active or not, this situation may result in unnecessary resource consumption
in the SGW and the UE in the following two cases:
\- The procedure of \"EPS bearers enabling for small data fast path\" is
actually transparent to the eNB. I.e. the HSS, the MME, the SGW and the UE
need to have the supporting capability in order to enable the fast path
bearer, but the capability of the eNB is not taken into account. It\'s further
described in TR 23.887 [26] that \"_when bearers have been enabled for small
data fast path in the UE, MME and SGW, and the current eNB does not support
small data fast path, a fast path is never activated_ \". Therefore, in case
where the UE is camped on a legacy eNB, the PDN contexts in the SGW and the UE
which are already created at fast path enabling procedure will never be used
because the fast path is never activated. Such resource consumption is
particularly unnecessary for low mobility or stationary UEs camped on legacy
eNBs which hardly get the chance to move to eNBs supporting fast path
activation. A mechanism is needed for the network to avoid unnecessary
resource consumption for security context.
\- Also the current solution described in TR 23.887 [26] provides no clear
mechanism to disable the fast path bearer once enabled. I.e. there\'s no clear
indication when to delete the security contexts in the SGW and the UE for fast
path bearer. Although it can be assumed that fast path bearer can be
implicitly disabled due to SGW relocation (e.g. new SGW Bearer Resource ID
overwrites the old SGW Bearer Resource ID in the UE), such implicit disabling
is hardly applicable to fast path bearers in low mobility or stationary UEs.
The small data PDN contexts may unnecessarily occupy the resources in the UE
and the SGW for a long time only for infrequent communication. The trade-off
between saving the S1AP signalling between MME and eNB for setting up the UE
context in the eNB at IDLE-CONNECTED transition, and storing PDN contexts in
the SGW that may not be used, is under discussion.
#### 5.7.6.6 Security Evaluation on Different Solutions of Small Data
Optimization
Now both (clauses 5.7.6.4 and 5.7.6.5) types of security solutions can provide
the integrity and confidentiality protection small data transmission.
However, the protection through fast path in user plane will have impact on
security architecture and key hierarchy.
#### 5.7.6.7 Overall Evaluation
In this clause, all different solutions for Small Data Transmission are
compared from a security perspective. For convenience, the SA2 solutions are
divided into three different groups.
All solutions that include small amounts of data sent using control plane NAS
messages belong to the category \"CP\":
1) Small Data Transfer starting from RRC IDLE (E-UTRAN): Use of pre-
established NAS security context to transfer the IP packet as NAS signalling
without establishing RRC security.
2) Optimized handling of C-plane connection for Small Data and Device Trigger.
3) Standalone Small Data Service with T5/Tsp and generic NAS transport. MTC-
IWF based Secure Solution for Small data transmission (clause 5.7.4.4) is a
potential security solution for 3 being discussed in SA3.
Solutions proposing user plane transport in connectionless mode are combined
in the \"UP\" category:
4) Stateless Gateway for cost efficient transmission of infrequent or frequent
small data
6a) Small Data Fast Path
6b)Connectionless
Optimizations like data piggy-backing, combining of messages or re-using of
existing security context are combined in the category \"OPT\":
5**)** Downlink small data transfer using RRC message
7) Service Request signalling reduction by RRC message combining
8) Optimized Service Request procedure for UEs with a single bearer
9) Lean Service Request Procedure
Note 1: SA2 informed (S3-130618/ S2-132327) that solutions 4, 5, 7 and 9 are
dropped by SA2 from Rel-12.
Note 2: Solution 8 has been concluded with no security impact. Therefore,
evaluation on category \"OPT\" is skipped.
Criteria for an overall evaluation contain the impact to existing elements
(eNB, MME, SGW, and UE) from security point of view. Additional criterias are
implications to service aspects like Lawful Interception (LI), Mobility
aspects, restrictions on the usage (e.g. one radio bearer only), charging
aspects, and the efficiency of the optimization. Although the evaluation in
the present document is security related in general, important criterias for
evaluation are the magnitude of chances to the existing security framework,
security protocols, and key hierarchy.
Among solutions in category \"CP\", both solution 1 and solution 2 have
security impacts on the UE and the MME for supporting the partly ciphering of
initial L3 message. Also, the issue of whether or not the partial ciphering
may violate the current NAS protocol layer security concepts is still un-
clarified for solutions 1 and 2. However partly ciphering can reduce the
consumption of the encryption.
Editor\'s Note: Benefit from \"partly ciphering\" needs to be clarified.
For all of the solutions in category \"CP\", it doesn\'t need to use AS
security context and no need to derive AS keys such as K~RRC\ INT~, etc. and
the K~eNB~ transfer from MME to eNB.
Solution 3, as it utilizes the current NAS security for protecting small data
transferred through NAS PDU, it has no new security function but may impose
higher load on existing security functions.
MTC-IWF based Secure Solution is a security solution for Solution 3, it
introduces newsecurity protocol stack between the UE and the MTC-IWF with
impacts to UE, MME, HSS and MTC-IWF (as shown in clause 5.7.6.3.2). New
security association between UE and MTC-IWF is achieved by key
generation/derivation and algorithm negotiation procedure leading to new
security context establishment etc. And it also needs to impact MME and/or HSS
to generate and transfer such security parameter to UE and MTC-IWF. As a
result, extra security features are needed on UE, MTC-IWF, MME and/or HSS and
also their interfaces. MTC-IWF based solution shifts encryption/decryption
burden of security process from MME to MTC-IWF for SDT, if NAS signalling
encryption is not required.
Among solutions in category \"UP\", solution 4 has been dropped from Rel-12 as
decided by SA2.
\- Solution 6a as analyzed in clause 5.7.6.5 introduces new security functions
in the UE, the SGW, the MME, and the eNB, and modifies the existing security
framework (incl. deviation from the current EPS security architecture, new
security protocol). It may also introduce the new threats leading to small
data reaching the wrong destination.
\- Solution 6b as analyzed in clause 5.7.6.2, comes at the expense of
increased complexity in the UE, the eNB and the MME, as well as increased
resource consumption due to the caching of AS security contexts and related
tokens in UE and eNB.
Note 3: According to SA2#100, all SA2 solutions for \"efficient small data
transmission\" are dropped from Rel‑12.
# 6 General Security Requirement
Network should be able to perform access control for UE accessing network,
e.g. based on MTC feature and/or subscription type.
Editor\'s Note: The meaning of \"access control\" (only authorization or
authentication and authorization) need to be clarified.
# 7 Conclusions

and the normative text for Rel-11 SIMTC features were included in the SA2 TS

TS 33.187 [40]): Using USAT application paring (UE based paring).
###### ### Annex A: Key Issues and Solutions deferred from Rel-12
# A.1 Time controlled
## A.1.1 Issue Details
Time controlled is one of the MTC features. The point of this feature aims at
how to restrict UE\'s access to the network and avoid unnecessary network load
outside these pre-defined time periods. Three terminologies are used in this
feature, i.e. grant time interval, forbidden time interval, communication
window. The home network operator may restrict altering the time period e.g.
to avoid traffic when the MTC server is in maintenance by means of a
\'forbidden time interval\'. Typically, an MTC User agrees with an operator on
a predefined time period for a group of UEs. The time in which access is
permitted is termed a \'grant time interval.\' For many applications,
individual UEs do not need the total duration of this predefined time period
to communicate with the MTC Server. Typically a 5-10 minutes \'communication
window\' is sufficient for an individual UE.
## A.1.2 Threats
There are several solutions in TR 23.888 [10] to handle this feature. These
so-called time interval and time window can be defined/randomized by both UE
and MTC server in TR 23.888 [10] solutions. There exist security threats if
the intervals and time window are sent to UE without any protection. The
attackers can change time interval/window to limit or extend the time. UE will
not have enough time to finish the job when time interval/window is limited.
The UE will extend online time to do its job repeatedly and waste its power
and thus it will cause network congestion when time interval/window is
tampered to extend. Moreover, MTC users may be charged more according to TR
23.888 [10] when UE exchanges signalling or sends and receives data outside of
defined time intervals.
## A.1.3 Security requirements
Time interval and communication window should be integrity-protected when sent
to UE.
Editor\'s Note: It is ffs if other protection (e.g. confidentiality) is
required.
## A.1.4 Solutions
With regard to different scenarios of inform messages in solutions of TR
23.888 [10], current mechanisms can be used to solve the issue:
\- NAS protection
Time interval and communication window can be sent in the NAS to inform the UE
of the length of interval/window. After NAS SMC, security is setup for
protection. All NAS signalling messages should be integrity-protected
according to TS 33.401 [13], and therefore current LTE mechanisms ensure that
the time interval/window cannot be tampered. For GSM and UMTS, SA2 has not
defined any solutions yet. But the time interval/window should be protected in
this case as well.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how to protect time interval/window in GSM/UMTS when
SA2 figures out GSM/UMTS solutions for time controlled feature.
Application level protection
Another potential solution is that time interval/window is sent by MTC server
via application level data. Current mechanism, e.g. GBA push which is defined
in TS 33.223 [22], can be used to protect the data sent from MTC server. Or
some application security mechanism can also be used. However, these solutions
are out of 3GPP scope.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether there is any other solution for this
feature- time controlled.
## A.1.5 Evaluation
# A.2 Low Mobility
## A.2.1 Issue Details
Low mobility UEs do not move, move infrequently, or move only within a certain
region as defined in TS 22.368 [9] and TR 23.888 [10].
Service requirements of low mobility UEs are described in clause 7.2.1 of TS
22.368 [9] as follows:
_\"- The home network operator should be able to change the frequency of
mobility management procedures or simplify mobility management per MTC
Devices._
_\- The network operator should be able to define the frequency of location
updates performed by the MTC Device.\"_
When the UE moves, there is a solution in TR 23.888 [10] that \"the SGSN/MME
detects the moving and pages within the new area which is reported by RAN or
by the MTC Device explicitly.\"
## A.2.2 Threats
Threat 1: There can be security risks if the incorrect location information is
reported to the network.
# A.3 Security of UE Configuration
## A.3.1 Issues Details
Different UEs configuration options were introduced in stage 2 to
avoid/alleviate congestion and overload in the network, in particular to
control the network access from low priority UEs (i.e. delay tolerant).
There are two potential approaches for delivering the configuration commands
to the UEs.
One approach is using OMA device management (OMA DM) and the other is using
UICC OTA (as specified in ETSI TS 102 225 [17] / TS 102 226 [18] and 3GPP TS
31.115 [19] / TS 31.116 [20]). The OMA DM approach only applies to the
terminal part of the UE (ME). Respectively, UICC OTA is applied to UICC part
of the UE.
## A.3.2 Threats
Editor\'s Note: Further contributions are needed to identify the threats.
Without security protection, the configuration options will face MitM attack
when it\'s provisioned to the UEs.
## A.3.3 Security Requirements
**OMA DM case**
TS 24.368 (V1.0.1) [5] has defined the Management Object (MO) and possible
leaf objects to represent the UEs configuration options. They should be stored
securely in the UEs. In case of configuration options stored in the MTC ME:
The DM server should be authenticated by the MEs.
The MEs may be authenticated by the DM server.
OMA DM messages should be integrity-protected.
**UICC OTA case**
There are different security levels for OTA message protection. In the scope
of the configuration of UICC in UE:
The OTA server should be authenticated by the UICC.
The UICC may be authenticated by the OTA server.
UICC OTA messages should be integrity-protected.
UICC OTA messages should be confidentiality -protected.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether secure channel is needed to convey
configuration info from UICC to the MTC ME.
## A.3.4 Solutions
Editor\'s Note: Further contributions are needed.
### A.3.4.1 ME Configuration
OMA DM security, as specified in [7] and [8], contains a number of options,
where some are not needed for the purposes of the present document and others
are required. OMA DM security is therefore profiled in this clause as:
  * The UEs should have a root certificate to authenticate the DM server.
  * The root certificate needs to be provided to the UEs in a secure manner.
  * The root certificate should be securely stored.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how to securely store the certificate
  * The DM server and the UEs should support and use TLS according to the profile specified in Annex E of TS 33.310 [6].
To verify the validation of the DM service certificate one can consider either
OCSP or the use of a secure real time clock in the UE for expiry checking of
the DM server certificate. The choice of which one to be used by the UE may
depend on the usage characteristics (e.g. how often checking occurs). If a
secure real time clock in the UE is used, then the DM server certificate
should have a short validity time in order to be refreshed in time. If the DM
server certificate has expired but has not been revoked, the OCSP server will
not reply with certificate verification failure. Possible ways to overcome
this are that expired DM server certificates are also revoked or that the UE
sends a nonce to the OCSP server who then replies with correct time and the UE
can make the certificate verification itself.
Note: For devices identified as requiring additional security, the use of
secure real time clock may be provided by means of a secured environment
logically defined within the UE. Such a secured environment should protect the
real time clock from external attacks and tampering, and may additionally be
utilized for secure storage of the DM server certificate.
Editor\'s Note: The cost of implementing secure environment should be
considered
Editor\'s Note: The secure real time clock is FFS.
Editor\'s Note: it is FFS how short is sufficiently short for the DM
certificate validity duration.
### A.3.4.2 UICC Configuration
UICC OTA is specified in ETSI TS 102 225 [17] / TS 102 226 [18] and 3GPP TS
31.115 [19] / TS 31.116 [20].
In the scope of MTC configuration the security requirements are met using SPI
configuration for secured packets transmission, as described in 3GPP TS 31.115
[19] referencing ETSI TS 102 225 [17], or using PSK-TLS as described in 3GPP
TS 31.116 [20] referencing ETSI TS 102 225 [17] for secured messages based on
HTTPS.
## A.3.5 Evaluation
# A.4 Reject message without integrity protection
## A.4.1 Issue Details
In the overload situation, the MM/GMM/EMM reject cause values such as \"IMSI
unknown in HLR\"; \"illegal ME\"; and \"PLMN not allowed\" could be wrongly
sent \"in panic\" by an overloaded (V)PLMN.
It\'s unrealistic for SGSN/MME to get authentication vector from the HSS,
perform a successful AKA with the UE, then perform the security mode command
procedure for integrity protection and encryption. So the MM/GMM/EMM Reject
message will be sent to the UE without with integrity protection.
## A.4.2 Threats
If the Reject message is sent without integrity protected, any false base
station can fake the MM/GMM/EMM reject cause values such as \"IMSI unknown in
HLR\", \"illegal ME\", or \"PLMN not allowed\" in the Reject message as a
denial of service attack to the UEs and the network.
## A.4.3 Security Requirements
A security mechanism is needed to prevent the DoS attack.
# A.5 Congestion Control
## A.5.1 Issue Details
In order to combat signalling congestion, network nodes should be able to
reject or prevent attach or connection requests. The challenge is to block the
traffic of the particular UE(s) used for MTC that is causing the congestion,
without restricting non-MTC traffic or traffic from other UEs that are not
causing a problem. SA2 has designed several solutions for it. The aim of these
solutions is when the network finds that the UE used for MTC that will cause
congestion or the UE is a low priority UE, it will reject the connection
request. So the UE can use e.g. a low access priority indicator or delay
tolerant access.
## A.5.2 Threats
When requesting access to the mobile network, a UE should provide its
currently enabled indicators to the network. There exist security threats if
the indicators are sent without any protection. The attackers can tamper with
the low access priority indicators or delay tolerant access to the normal
state to let many UEs connect when the network setup congestion control
mechanism. The problem is serious since nowadays congestion is the most urgent
issue that operators face. Vice versa, if an attacker adds a fake low access
priority indicator or delay tolerant access in the request sent by normal UEs,
the service of normal UEs (esp. some VIP users) will be maliciously degraded.
## A.5.3 Security requirements
The low access priority indicator should be integrity-protected according to
the rules in TS 33.102 [12], TS 33.401 [13], TS 23.060 [3] and TS 23.401 [4].
## A.5.4 Solutions
CN mechanism for congestion control:
If the UE has valid security context, then the Attach Request and LAU/RAU/TAU
request should be integrity protected.
However, attach request and TAU request cannot be protected, when the UE does
not have a valid security context, e.g. when UE connects to the network for
the first time.
In UMTS case, initial L3 messages could not be integrity protected since they
are sent before security on air interface is activated. Attach Request and
LAU/RAU request could not be integrity protected if they are sent as initial
L3 messages.
In GSM/GPRS case, integrity protection is not provided. Attach Request and
LAU/RAU request could not be integrity protected. In addition, Attach Request
and LAU/RAU request could not be ciphered either if they are sent as initial
L3 messages.
Editor\'s Note: In case that Attach Request and LAU/RAU/TAU request could not
be protected by the current mechanism, security solutions for congestion
control are FFS.
RAN mechanism for congestion control:
In UMTS/LTE case, RRC connection request is sent via SRB0 before security
activated. Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0. In
GSM/GPRS case, integrity protection is not provided. The \"delay tolerant
access\" in the RRC connection request cannot be integrity protected.
Also when the network rejects the RRC connection request (due to overload
condition), the RRC connection reject message which carries extended wait
timer is neither integrity protection nor ciphered.
## A.5.5 Evaluation
# A.6 Group Based Feature
## A.6.1 Issue Details
SA2 is currently working on group based feature which includes the following
key issues: Group based Messaging, Group based Charging Optimizations, Group
based Policy Control and Group based Addressing and Identifiers. SA2 is
currently considering mechanism to distribute a group message from an SCS to
those members of an MTC group located in a particular geographic area [26].
According to the current architecture and solutions, MTC-IWF receives a group
message from SCS and forwards it to the target group of UEs.
As group based messaging can significantly reduce the overhead of network
resource, it may be required to protect the group messages.
For the UEs in one group, each may need to communicate with the network
individually so an independent session key for each device may be needed.
Editor\'s Note: Individual session key establishment per UE in the group need
to be considered and studied further.
For the UEs in one group, the network may need to distribute the same message
(e.g. a trigger request) to those members of one MTC group so a same group
session key may be needed.
Editor\'s Note: The same MTC group session key establishment for all UEs in
the group need to be considered and studied further.
## A.6.2 Threats
If the broadcast message for a particular group is not protected, then private
information related to particular group are revealed. Therefore a mechanism
should be provided to protect the confidentiality of the group message
broadcasted for a particular group. However confidentiality protection is
subject to regional regulatory requirements.
Group based messaging would be more prone to tampering and fake triggering
attacks, if there is no integrity and replay protection provided by the core
network or by the SCS.
With a group message multiple UEs can be triggered. Therefore an unauthorized
group message may cause much more severe problem compared to what a trigger to
a single UE can cause. Other threats like MitM attack which were considered
for non-group message also apply here with amplified effect.
## A.6.3 Security Requirements
A MTC Group is a group of UEs that can be in the same area and/or have the
same MTC Features attributed and/or belong to the same MTC user. MTC Group
should be identified uniquely across 3GPP networks.
Editor Notes: It should be studied further, to what extent group based
protection and management can be used to save network resource and improve
efficiency.
There should be a mechanism by which an UE can be verified as a legitimate
member of an MTC Group.
Requirements on group based messaging:
  * MTC-IWF should verify if the SCS is authorized to send group message to a given MTC group.
  * Network should be able to distinguish group message from other messages.
  * Group message that are distributed to the group of UEs should be integrity protected, replay protected and may be confidentiality protected.
  * Local Group ID should not to be exposed to an entity that is located outside of 3GPP network. This includes the SCS which is outside of 3GPP network as well.
## A.6.4 Solutions
### A.6.4.1 Solution 1: Application layer based protection
Security protection applied at MTC application layer is a straightforward
solution. However, the network should trust the SCS and assure/ensure that SCS
protects the group message and MTC application in the UE verifies it. In case,
if the security is not applied in the application layer, then there can be
attacks on the network.
SCS should apply encryption, signature and replay protection to the group
message. The MTC application on the UE should verify the source of the group
message and ensure the integrity of the received group message. The mechanism
to verify the integrity of the group message, encryption/decryption and replay
protection by the MTC application layer is out of scope of the present
document.
The UE should discard the group message if it is not signed and replay
protected by the SCS.
Editor\'s Note: It is ffs, whether key management for application layer based
protection is within scope of 3GPP.
### A.6.4.2 Solution 2: Network based protection for cell broadcast
In network based protection, MTC-IWF generates the keys for group message
protection and protects the group message. The figure A.6.4.2-1 shows the
message sequence and describes the mechanism for EPS.
Editor\'s Note: The below solution is intended for LTE, it is FFS on
applicability of this solution in GSM/UMTS.
Figure A.6.4.2-1: Network based protection for cell broadcast
1\. The MTC-IWF creates the group and generates the group encryption key for
encrypting the group message. MTC-IWF uses the PKI infrastructure for signing
the group message and symmetric key (Gkey) is used for encryption/decryption
of the group messages.
Editor\'s Note: Need to check with SA2 for the specific node in the 3GPP
network responsible for group formation. Based on the SA2 decisions, other
suitable network elements for group key generation and key management are FFS.
2\. The MTC-IWF updates the HSS with the public key and the encryption key for
a particular group with the Group ID. The HSS maintain/maps the group based
feature subscription details along with the UE subscription data.
3\. During individual authentication, the MME fetches subscription data from
the HSS. If the UE is subscribed for group based feature, then the
subscription data contains the group based feature information (GID,
encryption key, public key and the key index).
4\. After successful authentication, the MME passes the group keys to the UE.
The MME protects the keys using the NAS security context.
Editor\'s Note: Further study may be required on the possibility of using
dedicated NAS message for group key distribution. Also further study is
required on whether the NAS message carrying the group key requires partial
encryption for protecting the group keys.
5\. When the SCS wants to send the group message, it provides the group
message over Tsp interface.
6\. The MTC-IWF protects the group message based on the Group ID received from
SCS or from the HSS.
7\. The MTC-IWF sends the protected group messages to the selected CBC. The
protected group message includes the key ID and also algorithm ID used for
protection.
Editor\'s Note：Mechanisms for signature algorithm selection is FFS.
### A.6.4.3 Solution 3: MBMS based method
MBMS security can provide shared key for data transferring. So it can be used
to protect the group message transferred from one MTC application server/MTC
SCS to multiple UEs in the group when the UEs use shared secret keys for
transferring.
Otherwise, when all UEs in one group need to be authenticated together, or UE
wants to communicate with MTC application server/MTC SCS/network individually,
or UEs wants to send uplink data, the current MBMS security solution can\'t be
applied.
### A.6.4.4 Solution 4: Authentication of UEs of a group
There are two options to authenticate UEs of a group. One option is that
network performs two steps authentication: the first is to identify the
individual UE and the second is to associate this UE as a member of MTC group.
The other option is that network authenticates all related UE in a group
together at the same time, by which the authentication solution can be called
as group authentication. If such group authentication is used, it can save
network resource to combine the two steps into one step.
Editor Note: whether or not group authentication can save network resource is
ffs.
## A.6.5 Evaluation
Editor Note: it is ffs to see if there are any security threats on the group
authentication.
Editor Note: How to achieve a balance between network resource saving and
solution complexity is FFS.
# A.7 Monitoring
## A.7.1 Issue Details
As discussed in TR 23.888 (clause 5.10.1) [10], UEs may be deployed in
locations with high risk, e.g. possibility of theft of the communication
module. There are UEs that should not move from an authorized location, or
should only move in an authorized area. For those UEs, it is desirable that
the network detects and reports events (including location) caused by those
devices that may result, for example, from theft of the communication module.
If such an event is detected, the network might be configured to perform
special actions. There are UEs that can move in a widely open area without
restriction (e.g. UEs that are used to track cargo, animals, vehicle, etc.).
## A.7.2 Threats
In the case of an MTC application where the UE should not move from an
authorized location, or should only move in an authorized area (e.g. within a
home), there could be security risks if the device is operated from an
unauthorized location (e.g. as a result of theft of the communication module).
For example, a water metering used in user A\'s home to record user A\'s water
usage should be fixed in user A\'s home. If it is moved to another place like
B\'s home without permission, it could potentially be used to report user B\'s
water usage against user A\'s account. The primary method to mitigate this
attack should be to bind the identity and authentication of the UE to the
specific user\'s water meter. Detecting or preventing a change in location of
the UE could be a useful secondary security mechanism.
Another example is fire monitor in the building. When a fire monitor is moved
to another place, wrong location information will be sent to the fire
monitoring server if there is a fire. In this case detecting change of the
location of the UE would be a useful feature.
For mobile UEs used for tracking purposes, the mobile area is not limited for
mobile UEs, the network can not verify if the UE is stolen or controlled by
attackers just by comparing the location identifier of UE and the pre-defined
location identifier stored in the network. As a result, the stolen vehicle
monitor of A may be used for B, or attackers with stolen UE can report a wrong
location identifier to the network, or attackers can use UE to trace other
peoples\' positions, etc.
For those UEs that can be linked to an individual, MTC Monitoring could cause
an invasion of privacy. In particularly, if MTC Monitoring is applied to UEs
that should not be monitored.
## A.7.3 Security Requirements
It is required for the network to provide a location management mechanism for
UEs that should not move from an authorized location, or should only move in
an authorized area to detect if the device has been moved to an unauthorized
location.
The network should be able to distinguish between UEs that have restriction in
movement and those that do not have restriction and manage their mobility
accordingly, i.e. where they can be used and cannot be used.
The network should be able to prevent MTC monitoring to be activated for those
devices that should or are not monitored by the network.
## A.7.4 Solutions
### A.7.4.1 Location Management
#### A.7.4.1.0 General
The requirement mentioned in clause 5.6.3 of the present document, can be met
as follows.
UE reports the location identifiers. Network entity (e.g. SGSN/MME) should
store the pre-defined location identifier and be able to verify the location
identifier by comparing these two identifiers.
When the UE moves; a network entity (e.g. MSC/SGSN/MME) receives new location
information which is reported by RAN or by the UE explicitly and detects if it
is different from pre-configured location information. Then the network entity
can confirm that the UE has moved to other area and will send a warning
message to the MTC server, which can then take further action.
Editor\'s Note: Multiple solutions are being considered in SA2 about which
network entity detects and reports unauthorized movements.
Editor\'s Note: Granularity of above mentioned location identifiers and the
resulting impact on the ability of the solutions to meet the requirements, as
well as possible other solutions (e.g. solutions relying on network reporting)
are ffs.
#### A.7.4.1.1 Impacts on existing nodes or functionality
A network entity should be able to store the pre-configured location
information of UE with low mobility feature.
A network entity should be able to send warning to MTC server that UE is not
in the authorized location/area.
