# 1 Scope
The present document studies methodologies for specifying network product
security assurance and hardening requirements, with associated test cases when
feasible, of 3GPP network products. Network product security assurance and
hardening refers to protection against unwanted access to a 3GPP network
product, its Operating System, and main running Application(s). The
suitability of industry standard methodologies and the potential need for
collaboration with bodies such as GSMA, CCRA, ISO and ITU will be assessed.
The study will also consider regulatory aspects and the potential need for
security certification. The suitability of the candidate methodologies will be
assessed with reference to real world examples.
Part of the scope of this work is to conclude which 3GPP network products, if
not all, would be subject to 3GPP network product security assurance and
hardening requirements. There is likely to be a long list with the result that
prioritisation will be required. LTE network product classes will be the first
priority. The work will also study exactly what should constitute a 3GPP
network product in the context of this study e.g. whether it should be an
individual 3GPP functional entity, a group of 3GPP functional entities or some
other realisation.
The study will also include assessing the extent to which individual 3GPP
network products need to be hardened beyond a common baseline and should take
into consideration network vs. environment.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply.\ A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Security Assurance Specification (SCAS):** The SCAS for a given network
product class provides a description of the security requirements (which are
including test cases) pertaining to that network product class.
**3GPP Security Assurance Methodology (SECAM):** The SECAM is a process used
to measure the security features of 3GPP network products studied and
described in the present document.
**Accreditation:** Formal recognition by an accreditation body that a testing
laboratory is impartial and competent to carry out specific tests or types of
assessments. In the context of SECAM, it would be recognition that a testing
laboratory is competent to assess the 3GPP network product against the
requirements from the 3GPP SCAS and to produce an evaluation report.
NOTE 1: If an accreditation body is not chosen for SECAM by 3GPP or GSMA
(TBD), it will not be possible to know how widely the evaluation results will
be recognized. For example, if the accreditation lab chosen by a vendor for
evaluation (self-evaluation or third-party evaluation) is not recognized by a
country where the products are to be sold, then the evaluation results would
become equivalent to self-evaluation without accreditation in this country.
**Self-declaration:** Self-declaration is a declaration of the claims made on
the network product by the vendor.\ It means that a vendor provides a self-
declaration of its network product based on the evaluation report required by
SECAM to the operator without any review of a certification authority of these
reports before.
**Evaluation without accreditation:** Evaluation as defined below in self-
evaluation or third-party evaluation but without accreditation of the labs in
the country where the Security Assurance process is required.
**Self-evaluation:** Self-evaluation is an assessment of the network product
by the vendor. It means that the vendor has an accredited evaluation lab in
its organization that performs the evaluation of the network product. The
evaluation lab assesses the network product against defined criteria and
produces an evaluation report according to a formalized and standardized
procedure.
**Third-party evaluation:** Third-party-evaluation is an assessment of the
network product by an independent third-party. It means that a third-party has
an accredited evaluation lab that performs the evaluation of the network
product.\ The evaluation lab assesses the network product against defined
criteria and produces an evaluation report according to a formalized and
standardized procedure. Third-party evaluation is similar to self-evaluation.
The only difference is that the party performing the evaluation is different
from the vendor.
**Certification:** Certification is the confirmation by an independent
Certification Authority (CA) that the evaluation has been properly carried
out. That is, a confirmation that the evaluation criteria, evaluation methods
and other procedures have been correctly applied and that the conclusions of
the evaluation report are consistent with the evidence adduced.\ The CA does
not test the network product or verify the security functionality of the
network product. The CA examines the evaluation report. If the CA finds the
evaluation report satisfactory, it issues a certificate stating this fact.
**Certificate:** The certificate is the official document attesting that the
evaluation of the 3GPP network product against the 3GPP Security Assurance
Specifications (SCAS) was conducted correctly and was successful. This
document is provided by the third-party certification authority. The
certificate provides the value that an operator that trusts the Certification
Authority (CA) can feel more assured about that the network product fulfils
the claimed security level.
**Evaluator:** evaluates the network product and produces an evaluation
report. The vendor, the operator, GSMA, NVIOT, 3GPP, GCF or some other party,
could take the evaluator role.
**Auditee:** The Auditee is the 3GPP network product vendor who is to be
evaluated. The Auditee is responsible for supplying all necessary information
to the evaluators at the beginning of the evaluation.
**Certification Authority (CA):** the entity responsible for the certification
process.
**Accreditation Authority:** the entity responsible for the accreditation
process.
**Assurance: is the confidence that a network product meets its specific
security objectives. Assurance is usually verified by performing an
evaluation.**
**Assurance level** : is related to evaluation effort in terms of **scope,
depth and rigor. For higher assurance level, more information with more
details is typically required, and this information will be analysed more
rigorously.**
NOTE 2: At this point the \"3GPP Assurance Levels\" have nothing to do with
\"Evaluated Assurance Levels\" used in Common Criteria. It is for further
study how and even if the two map.
**Hardening: contributes to the security baseline of a network product,
achieved for example by configurations, settings, and protocol restrictions,
to decrease the attack surface for a network product. The difference in
hardening is one aspect that influences the security baseline of a network
product.**
**Security baseline:** The security baseline of an evaluated network product
is a set of security requirements and environmental assumptions defining its
capacity to resist a given attack potential.
NOTE 3: It is for further study if and how \"3GPP Security baselines\" take
account of and map to those used in other schemes for example the Basic,
Medium, and High \"Robustness Levels\" in NSA NIST.
**Vulnerability:** An exploitable issue in a network product rendering it
unable to withstand attacks. Vulnerabilities create the risk of successful
attacks**.**
**Vulnerability Assessment (VA):** The process of assessing the output of SCT
or BVT activities to classify the found issues by severity in order to
identify those which are relevant vulnerabilities.
**Security Compliance Testing (SCT):** Evaluation process step used in
Methodology 2 to describe activities for checking the compliance of a network
product with applicable Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS).
**Basic Vulnerability Testing (BVT): The pr** ocess of running security tools
against a network product.\ In Methodology 2, BVT is defined by the use of
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
security testing tools on the external interfaces of the network product.
Details on these tools can be found in Annex A.2.1.
**Enhanced Vulnerability Testing (EVA):** Evaluation process step used in
Methodology 2 and described in clause 5.2.4.5. This activity takes the output
of the earlier Security Compliance Testing (SCT) and Basic Vulnerability
Testing (BVT) into account.
NOTE 4: The exact scope and activities of EVA is FFS in a future Study Item.
Examples include more advanced activities than executed during the Basic
Vulnerability Testing (BVT) stage and chaining of vulnerabilities to penetrate
the tested system. EVA may depend highly on the skills of the testers.
**Network product class:** A network product class, in the context of SECAM,
is the class of products that all implements a common set of 3GPP defined
functionalities.
**Network product:** A network product is the instantiation of one or more
network product class(es).

# 4 3GPP network products and threat model
## 4.1 Considerations on definition of the term \"network products\"
### 4.1.1 3GPP function specific requirements vs. platform/node requirements
A SCAS will be produced with some specific target in mind, this target being
related to the realization of some 3GPP defined functionality. For example, if
the 3GPP function SGSN is implemented on a server platform, a SCAS may have a
security requirement that the software updates to the server platform where
the SGSN function is running shall be integrity protected. However, the SGSN
function as defined in 3GPP does not have a defined capability for updates to
the server platform. Therefore such a requirement cannot be put on the SGSN
seen as a function. The server platform here includes the hardware components,
the operating system, etc.
However, in the end, 3GPP functions are implemented in one platform or another
and this must be taken into account in this study.
There is hence a need to distinguish between at least two types of
requirements for the purpose of the discussion in this clause. These two types
are platform requirements that relate to the hardware and operating system,
and 3GPP function requirements that relate to protocol behaviour defined in
3GPP technical specifications. There may be further subdivision of these
requirements, e.g., the platform requirements may be subdivided into hardware
related requirements and requirements related to secure boot etc. However that
is not necessary for the discussion in this clause.
### 4.1.2 Distribution of 3GPP functions over nodes
For simplicity, a physical entity implementing one or more 3GPP functions will
be referred to as a node in the clause 4.1.
**One node -- many functions**
3GPP mainly defines logical functions. For example, an SGSN and an MME are two
3GPP functions in the 3GPP architecture. Often they are thought of as two
different nodes. However, it may in some cases be advantageous to implement
these two 3GPP functions in the same node. Other examples of co-location are
when the RNC 3GPP function is implemented in the same node as a NodeB 3GPP
function. In fact, an entire mobile network may be implemented in the same
node. The latter is sometimes referred to as \"network-in-a-box\" and can be
useful in situations where fast deployment is necessary, e.g., in catastrophe
areas.
**One 3GPP function -- many nodes**
Coming from the other direction, it is also common that the implementation of
a single 3GPP function is split over several nodes. An example is the HSS. The
HSS may be split so that there are a set of back end databases storing the
subscription data and a set of front ends that implement the protocol
interfaces toward other functions, such as the MME. The back ends and the
front ends may be implemented in separate physical nodes. This is treated as
an implementation detail in the 3GPP specifications and should be continued to
be treated as such for flexibility.
**Observations**
\- **More than one SCAS may apply to a particular node**. A situation where
this will occur is for example where the RNC 3GPP function is co-located with
the NodeB. Already today the specifications require more security from RNCs in
so-called vulnerable locations than from RNCs in more secure locations.
\- **Depending on implementation, a SCAS may not apply to the entire 3GPP
function**. A situation where this may occur is the HSS example from above.
The AuC most likely will have much harder requirements than other parts of the
HSS. It may not be necessary to require the same strong security for all parts
of the HSS since this will unnecessarily raise the cost of these nodes.
\- **One SCAS per 3GPP function lead to too many SCASs**. There are too many
3GPP functions in the 3GPP architecture to have one SCAS per function.
Combinations of 3GPP functions and platform requirements make this problem
even larger. One SCAS must hence cover more than one 3GPP function. 3GPP
functions that are similar, for some definition of \"similar\", must be
grouped together for this to be manageable.
### 4.1.3 Environment of functions and nodes
**Physical location of functions and nodes**
3GPP functions in the core network have traditionally been considered to be
placed in secure location. Their locations are considered trusted to not be
physically accessible to attackers. Functions and nodes physically located in
secure locations, such as in the core network, must be considered to be safe
from physical tampering. The requirements on functions/nodes in the RAN may in
most cases not make this assumption.
A problem is that functions may not always be located in the core network.
Depending on implementation, they may be located in the RAN or in third-party
facilities and locations. Therefore more than one type of SCAS may apply to a
single function (if that is the chosen target) depending on the deployment of
the function. For example, one SCAS module could describe requirements for
only the physical protection of a function/node, whereas a second SCAS module
may describe the requirements for only the function provided. If the node is
built to be located in a physically vulnerable location then the first SCAS
and the second SCAS are applied. If the node is built to be located in
physically secure location, then only the second SCAS is applied
For example, RNCs located in so called exposed locations are required to
implement IPsec to protect the backhaul just like eNBs, whereas when the RNC
is not in an exposed location the requirement on IPsec would not always be
necessary when the Iu interface could be assumed to be physically secured (cf
TS 33.210 [19]).
Another example is that Network Functions Virtualisation products (such as
virtual MME, virtual HSS and virtual Firewall, etc.) may be installed on a
third-party Internet Data Center (IDC) facility which is a so-called "non-
trusted domain". In this case, it should be required that encryption be
applied on data transmission and data storage, so that an operator's operation
and maintenance data are properly protected.
**Remote exposure of functions/nodes in the network architecture**
3GPP functions of which at least one interface is accessible from outside the
network security domain can be considered to be in a more hostile location
than nodes assumed to be only accessible from within the network security
domain. For example, a PGW is accessible from some PDN, and can then be
attacked via this network. To prevent this attack, a firewall might be needed.
But in case there is no firewall, the PGW is required to properly filter
incoming traffic. Therefore, the network architecture and remote accessibility
significantly influences security requirements.
NOTE: None of the definitions of remote accessibility and physical location
are complete until the attacker model is defined.
Figure 4.1.3-1 describes possible combinations of remote and physical
exposure.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether security measures should be taken into
account when determining the degree of exposure according to the definitions
above.
{width="4.096527777777778in" height="4.464583333333334in"}
Figure 4.1.3-1: Environment of 3GPP network products
NOTE: It might be meaningful to use the original terms "physically exposed"
and "physically unexposed" in certain contexts for easy understanding instead
of "trusted and non-trusted domain located". For example, when necessary, we
can say: "RNC is located in an exposed location (which is in an un-trusted
domain)."
**Consequences**
From the above analysis, the environment needs to be taken into account when
defining the SCAS to be applied to a particular network product. The word
"environment" refers to the location in a trusted domain such as HSS in a
physically unexposed location, or the location in a non-trusted domain such as
RNC in a physically exposed location. The word "environment" may also refer to
the remote exposure case. To sum up all possible differentiation aspects could
become an intractable task, if playing with the full range of threat or
location parameters. Instead, robustness against some uncertainty and
variability in the environment shall prevail.
### 4.1.4 Relationship between network products classes, SCAS and 3GPP
functions
1\. When defining a network product class, it needs to be defined which 3GPP
functional entities or part of 3GPP functional entities are within this
network product class
2\. SCAS will have to be developed in a modular fashion such that an
individual module is generic enough to be applied to more than one network
product class. The assumption is that this modularity will allow a reasonable
number of SCAS.
3\. In a third step, it would be decided which SCAS modules apply to which
network product classes
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS in which cases these additional SCAS modules will be
optional or mandatory.
There will be a single SCAS for a given network product class. The
standardization will start with a given network product class for
consideration (for example an RNC). During the threat analysis phase, an
agreed level of exposure for the network product class under consideration
will be chosen. If no agreement can be found on the exposure level, it is
likely to be because the initial definition of the network product class under
consideration was too wide, for example because RNC class also included so
called collapse RNC/NBs which have a too different exposure level from
classical RNCs.
In this case a new network product class will be created on the fly: e.g.
collapsed RNC/NBs would be a different class from classical RNCs. This is
aligned with the assumption of a single SCAS per network product class.
## 4.2 Sample 3GPP network products for the methodology study
One of the goals of this study is to choose a methodology for specifying
network product security assurance and hardening requirements, with associated
test cases when feasible, on 3GPP network products. In order to choose this
methodology, it is not needed to validate the methodology on all 3GPP network
products as it would make the study unnecessarily long.
Clause 4.1 describes the aspects to be considered in order to choose relevant
sample for the methodology evaluation:
\- Distribution of 3GPP functions over nodes
\- 3GPP function specific requirements vs. platform/node requirements
\- Location of function and nodes
To address the last bullet, one example in an exposed location and one in the
core network will be considered. To address the first two bullets, one example
implementing two 3GPP functions will be considered.
NOTE: For the purpose of this study, it will be considered that these network
products are owned and managed by a single operator.
**Core network product class:**
The core network 3GPP functions to be used as an example for the study will be
the SGSN and the MME ones, in a form of a physically combined SGSN/MME.
**Exposed location network product class:**
The exposed 3GPP function to be used as an example for the study will be an
eNodeB.
## 4.3 Threat and attacker model for the Security Assurance study
### 4.3.1 Attacker potential
The security functions needed to reach a given level of resistance are
dependent on the abilities of presumed attackers. The more powerful and
knowledgeable potential attackers are, the more and stronger security measures
are needed to counter the types of attacks these attackers might launch.
One aspect to consider is the location/environment of the 3GPP-defined
functionality.\ In an exposed location/environment it becomes difficult to
rule out any specific form of attacker.\ In a highly protected location on the
other hand, the only potential attackers with physical access are insiders.\
Insiders are often more knowledgeable than outsiders about technical
properties (e.g. implementation details) of the 3GPP-defined functionalities.
It is common to mitigate the risk of insider attacks by, amongst other
methods, organizational policies or vetting of employees - in which case no
additional technical means of defence are usually needed. However, in some
situations (e.g. access through 3^rd^ party maintenance personnel), it may be
necessary to consider additional security measures mitigating the risk of
insider attacks.
In order to be able to assure that a sufficient security level is met, it is
necessary to state in a well-defined way in which environment the 3GPP-defined
functionality is assumed to be operating and what types of attackers (if any)
may be able to launch attacks from the outside as well as from the inside of
this environment.
### 4.3.2 Threats model
There are many threat and risks analysis or modelling framework available for
IT equipment and computers networks. SECAM will cover threats related to 3GPP
functions as well as threats related to generic IT functions.\ None of the
framework is likely to perfectly fit the needs of SECAM which ultimate goal is
to be capable to derive concrete and testable security requirements to reduce
the level of exposure of telecom equipment.
Having a look at these threat modelling/analysis frameworks to identify the
main threats categories/attack paths will help 3GPP SA3 to move faster for
this step of writing the threat and risk analysis in the normative phase of
SECAM.\ It is however not a pre-requisite for deciding on the SECAM
methodology and for moving in the normative phase.
Annex D provides description of different alternative framework that could
help to structure the work.
## 4.4 3GPP network products subject to Security Assurance Specifications
(SCAS)
### 4.4.1 Access network
For this study the following access network product is in the scope:
\- eNodeB
NOTE: SECAM Security Assurance Specification will cover network product
classes. There is no reason to assume that SECAM evaluation would not be
applicable to specific form factors of base stations (metrocells, microcells)
as long as the functions and interfaces of these small form factor base
stations are the same as the ones of an eNodeB network product class.
\- H(e)NodeB
NOTE: Considering that H(e)NBs rely on a different security architecture with
a different functional split, they are considered as a different network
product class for SECAM.
### 4.4.2 Core network
For this study the following core network products are in the scope:
\- Mobility Management Entity (MME)
\- Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)
\- Serving Gateway (S-GW)
\- PDN Gateway (PDN GW)
\- Security Gateway
\- Home Subscriber Server (HSS)
\- PCRF
\- AAA server
NOTE: AAA Server should be in the scope of this study because they can be
reachable from equipment not belonging to the internal Mobile Network.
\- Operation and Maintenance Servers/Applications (OAM Servers/Applications)
\- Call Session Control Function (CSCF)
Editor's note: Whether other classes of IMS network products will be included
is FFS.
## 4.5 Roles and processes applicable to all methodologies
### 4.5.1 Introduction
This clause describes the most important elements, roles and processes from
which the security assurance process is built. The clause also describes how
these components fit together in the security assurance process.\ The process
is independent from the methodology chosen. It does, however, impose
requirements on what the methodology has to provide, i.e., each methodology
shall define how an evaluation is performed and optionally how the
certification step is performed.
In clause 4.5.2, the process is described without defining which party takes
on which role.\ Clause 4.5.3 defines the different roles, and finally, clause
4.5.4 defines the steps in the process in more detail and the inputs and
outputs to these steps.
The current business environment implicitly defines some of the roles and
steps in the security assurance process.\ The reason for this is that there
are informal and less rigorous security assurance processes for 3GPP related
products already today. For example, the start and end of the process are
already defined; the vendor produces the network product and the operator
decides to accept or reject the provided assurance regarding security of the
network product. These existing processes are vendor and operator specific.
NOTE: The description of the legal framework for the evaluation/certification
process is outside of the scope of SA3.
### 4.5.2 Security assurance process
#### 4.5.2.1 Overview
The security assurance process describes how the operator gets assurance
regarding the security of the network product. The process is depicted in
Figure 4.5.2.1-1. If there are any regulatory requirements on security
assurance of the network product, they will for the purpose of this process
model be considered being included in the acceptance requirements of the
operator.
When a vendor is ready to provide security assurance w.r.t. a given network
product, the vendor obtains one or more Security Assurance Specifications
(SCASs) that the network product is aiming to fulfil. Choice of which SCASs to
select may depend on operator and/or regulatory input. Then the product is
evaluated against the Security Assurance Specification(s). During this step,
information may need to be exchanged between the evaluator, the vendor and/or
the operator. The evaluation results in an evaluation report. The roles are
described in clause 4.5.3; see that clause for a definition of the evaluator
role.
There are two alternatives how to proceed from this point. The choice of
alternative depends on whether the operator requires a certification to accept
the evaluation or not. If the operator requires certification of the
evaluation, a certification authority has to examine the evaluation report and
issue a certificate if satisfied. If, on the other hand, the operator does not
require certification, the certification can be ignored and the operator
receives only the evaluation report. Note that the party doing the evaluation
may be the same party that issues a certificate. However, since certification
is only an optional addition in the process, it is beneficial to separate the
evaluator role and the certification authority role; see clause 4.5.3 for
further descriptions of the roles.
Editor\'s note: The content of the evaluation report and the confidentiality
issues associated to it are FFS.
Once the operator received the evaluation report, and possibly an indication
of whether the network product passed certification, the operator takes a
decision to either accept the security assurance level of the network product
or not. The operator\'s acceptance decision may depend on external forces such
as regulatory requirements.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.9916666666666667in"}
Figure 4.5.2.1-1 Security assurance process.\ The text \"- OR -\" in the
figure indicates that the evaluation report may be provided\ directly to the
operator or that it may be subject to certification first.
The certification step is optional for use in addition to being optional to be
defined by the methodology.
NOTE: A commonly used term in the context of certification is so called
\"self-certification\". Since this technical report needs to use more granular
concepts, such as self-evaluation with and without accreditation in
combination with self-declaration, third-party evaluation in combination with
self-declaration etc., the term \"self-certification\" is too coarse and hence
not applicable. However, this does not rule out that self-evaluation without
certification can be performed.
Naturally, this is an idealized process description. In reality, there may be
iterations of the process or iterations of parts of the process. For example,
when the vendor provides an update impacting major functions of the network
product, the existing evaluation report may have to be updated. Following
that, possibly a re-certification and a new operator acceptance decision has
to be taken.
#### 4.5.2.2 Assurance level
Assurance level is related to evaluation effort in terms of:
\- scope -- that is, the effort is greater when a larger portion of the IT
product is evaluated; For example, when supplementary aspects of the
functionality are included in the evaluation;
\- depth -- that is, the effort is greater when evaluation is deployed to a
finer level of design and implementation detail;
\- rigour -- that is, the effort is greater when evaluation is applied in a
more structured, formal manner.\ For example, for a given security requirement
to test, the effort is greater if the evaluator is requested to provide a
formal demonstration that the product will always behave as intended versus
providing a given set of output test data for a limited set of test cases.
In SECAM:
\- Scope will be constant: SECAM intends to provide a single process for a
given network product class, which will be relevant to this class.
\- Depth of evaluation is also considered to be constant. The paradigm of
SECAM consists in:
\- Security compliance testing: the paradigm would consist in black box
verification of security requirements, but exceptions would be possible, e.g.
\- when required in order to demonstrate compliance for requirements on
cryptography, key storage, secure deletion, or implementation of protocols,
etc. (in such cases, code inspection would be more efficient than a functional
test);
\- when a white/grey box approach is considered more efficient (a black box
vulnerability scan over the network would take longer and reveal less than a
white box local system analysis).
\- Vulnerability testing: the general paradigm of vulnerability testing would
be consistent with the expected attacker model. Such testing will consequently
be based on black box vulnerability testing unless the expected attacker is
considered having a higher potential. In the latter case, white/grey box
penetration testing would be necessary to assess Target Of Evaluation (TOE)
resistance. For example, if an attacker were believed to have knowledge of TOE
implementation, a black box assessment only would be unreasonable
NOTE: Many notions depend on the result of threat analysis on the considered
network product classes.\ In particular, the difference between tests that are
considered to be part of security compliance testing or part of vulnerability
testing is left for the normative phase. The details on the type of
documentation that should be provided to vulnerability testers, in cases of
white box testing, depends on the attacker model and is also left for the
normative phase.
\- Build process assurance: Verification of build process is limited to basic
functional documentation, use of a configuration system and providing of
operational guidance
\- Rigour of verification is also considered constant, since it focuses on
demonstration for functional testing and vulnerability assessment,
justification when necessary, and does not requires formal demonstration.
Having multiple assurance levels would:
\- Make evaluators accreditation process more complex (different evaluators
might not be able to go to the same level of depth or to apply the same
rigour)
\- Fragment the evaluation market as operators might request different
assurance level for the evaluation of the same network product from a given
vendor
\- This would destroy the purpose of standardization effort which aims,
amongst others, at reducing the cost and the number of evaluation by agreeing
on a common acceptable level of assurance in a standard body for the entire
industry
\- This would also make results more difficult to compare for operators which
might receive evaluation at different assurance level for two network product
of the same network product class.
Considering that the three parameters are expected to be constant and the
above mentioned additional complexity of having several assurance levels.
However it is expected that different product class are confronted by
different attacker models, and have consequently to undergo different levels
of rigour or depth of evaluation.
**[SECAM consequently considers only one assurance level per network product
class.]{.underline}**
#### 4.5.2.3 Security baseline
The security baseline of an evaluated network product is a set of security
requirements and environmental assumptions defining its capacity to resist a
given attack potential.
This resistance to a given attack potential relies on:
\- Attacker model and attacker potential agreed to be relevant for a given
network product class
\- The completeness and correct implementation of security requirements and
operational environment assumptions which limit the capacity of this attacker
to threaten given assets
\- Security requirements can be more demanding in some network elements, e.g.
exposed nodes will have to implement hardening requirements which will not
necessarily be needed in elements less exposed
\- Vulnerability assessment will be performed with more depth whenever the
element is expected to resist a stronger attacker.
As pointed out in clause 4.3.1 \"it is necessary to state in a well-defined
way in which environment the 3GPP-defined functionality is assumed to be
operating and what types of attackers (if any) may be able to launch attacks
from the outside as well as from the inside of this environment\". This
assessment will be accomplished in the normative stage of SECAM during the
SCAS writing phase and be related to the threat and risk analysis outcomes.
At the end of this process, for each network product class, 3GPP SA3 will have
precisely defined the attacker model as well as the operational environment
assumption and the security requirements to mitigate the identified risks.\
The expected modularity of SCAS as described in clause 4.1.4 should allow an
easy composition of SCAS modules to describe all the countermeasures of a
given network product class and to take the particular environment of the node
into account.
The entire set of security requirements, operational environment assumptions
and attacker model will be built to achieve a security baseline deemed
relevant by SA3 for a network product class. This will result in one security
level per network product class (security level MME, security level HSS,
security level eNodeB ...).\ These baselines are not meant to be compared to
one another as they are applying on different network product classes.
Having multiple security baselines for a single network product class would:
\- Make evaluators accreditation process more complex (different evaluators
might not be able to undergo the full range of security test of a given
security baseline)
\- Fragment the evaluation market as operators might request different
security baselines for the evaluation of the same network product from a given
vendor
\- This would destroy the purpose of standardization effort which aims,
amongst others, at reducing the cost and the number of evaluation by agreeing
on a common acceptable security baseline in a standard body for the entire
industry
\- This would also make results more difficult to compare for operators which
might receive evaluation against two different baselines for two network
products of the same network product class.
\- For a given network product class, operators might be willing to have an
homogeneous set of equipment even if these equipment are deployed in various
environments with different exposure levels. An average agreeable level will
have to be found in the standardization process to make the evaluation
practical. If some supplementary very high security requirements are required
by a single or a few operators, these operators remain free to undergo further
evaluations outside of the standard SECAM process.
NOTE: Alternatively, but in rare cases, if no satisfactory average can be
found, you could define a new network product class: e.g. collapsed RNC/NBs
could be a class different from classical RNCs.
**[SECAM consequently considers only one security baseline per network product
class.]{.underline}**
### 4.5.3 Roles
#### 4.5.3.1 Roles involved in the security assurance process
Any security assurance process includes a number of roles. Figure 4.5.3.1-1
depicts the security assurance process studied in this technical report and
indicates which roles are involved in it. New roles need to be defined in
addition to the existing ones.
{width="6.691666666666666in" height="3.9604166666666667in"}

\"- OR -\" in the figure indicates that the evaluation report may be provided\
directly to the operator or that it may be subject to certification first.
Figure 4.5.3.1-1 Roles involved in the security assurance process. The text
\"- OR -\" in the figure indicates that the evaluation report may be provided
directly to the operator or that it may be subject to certification first.
#### 4.5.3.2 Implicit and existing roles
As explained in the introduction in clause 4.5.1, some roles are implicit from
the existing business environment. These roles are the following:
\- **Vendor** produces the network product;
\- **Operator** makes the decision regarding accepting assurance of security
properties of the product;
\- **3GPP** is responsible for producing Security Assurance Specifications
(SCASs).
#### 4.5.3.3 New roles
In addition to the already existing roles, three new roles are defined:
\- Evaluator;
\- Certification Authority;
\- Accreditation Authority.
The definition of these roles is in clause 3.1. Unlike the implicit roles, the
new role definitions do not fix which party should take on the role. For
example, the vendor, the operator, a second or third-party, could take the
evaluator role. If the vendor takes on the evaluator role it is referred to as
self-evaluation. If certification is not use, the vendor provides a self-
declaration to the operator.
3GPP does not have mandate to require that a certain role must be instantiated
by a certain legal entity; only a regulatory body can effectively make such a
requirement. 3GPP can however define the processes and roles and make an
agreement on which party should take on the roles. This does not rule out that
there will be regulatory requirements on who should take on a role that
differs from the 3GPP agreement.
NOTE: The instantiation of these roles will be provided in the candidate
methodologies if appropriate.
### 4.5.4 Sub-processes and documentation
#### 4.5.4.1 Security Assurance Specification (SCAS)
The Security Assurance Specification (SCAS) for a given network product class
provides a description of the security requirements pertaining to that network
product class. It is assumed that the latest version of the 3GPP Security
Assurance documents available at the beginning of a particular instance of an
evaluation will be used for 3GPP Security Assurance whatever the 3GPP Release
compliance of the other 3GPP functions of the product is. Evaluations
performed in the past remain valid, however, even when a new version of the
3GPP Security Assurance documents is published.
NOTE 1: Some security requirements might be specific to 3GPP features that
only exist from a specific 3GPP Release onwards for a given 3GPP Network
Product class. The 3GPP SCAS will give clear indication from which Release
onwards the test should be applied. The way to give this indication (by
grouping Rel-12 specific tests in an annex or by giving indication in the test
case as described in 5.2.2.1) is outside of the scope of this study.
NOTE 2: For features that are standardized in 3GPP specifications, maximum
advantage should be taken of existing threat analyses that are available from
3GPP Technical Reports (e.g. TR 33.821 for EPS [20]) or other publications.
NOTE 3: This clause needs to be further elaborated in the candidate
methodologies.
#### 4.5.4.2 Network product
The network product has to be accompanied by documentation regarding its
development to facilitate proper evaluation. It can also be expected that the
evaluator has to inquire further information from the vendor to perform the
evaluation.
NOTE: This clause needs to be further elaborated in the candidate
methodologies.
#### 4.5.4.3 Evaluation and evaluation report
The evaluation results in an evaluation report that describes the evaluation
performed and whether the evaluator deems that the network product fulfils the
Security Assurance Specification(s) that it claims to fulfil.
NOTE: This clause needs to be further elaborated in the candidate
methodologies.
#### 4.5.4.4 Certification and certificate
If the evaluation report states that the network product passed the evaluation
successfully, a Certification Authority may review the evaluation report. If
the review concludes that the evaluation report is satisfactory, the
Certification Authority may issue a certificate for the network product.
None of both candidate methodologies describes the certification process of a
network product so far. Methodology 2 describes a process of vendor
accreditation and a dispute process where the certificates are associated to
vendors and not to products. Methodology 1 has well-understood provision for
providing product certificate and network product certification. It should be
possible for methodology 2 too if it is desired.
NOTE: This clause needs to be further elaborated in the candidate
methodologies if appropriate.
#### 4.5.4.5 Operator security acceptance decision
The operator examines the network product, the evaluation report (and possibly
the certificate) and decides if the security assurance level is sufficient.
NOTE: This clause needs to be further elaborated in the candidate
methodologies.
#### 4.5.4.6 Revocation and dispute process
In the case that evaluation findings in the evaluation report are in dispute
for a network product (for example: by re-doing the tests an operator finds
opposite results to the ones provided by the vendors or third-party
laboratories in the evaluation report), it is desirable that the candidate
methodologies provide provision for conflict resolution and revocation.
NOTE: This clause needs to be further elaborated in the candidate
methodologies if appropriate.
# 5 Proposed methodologies
NOTE: Every proposed methodology will have to provide a reasonable number of
examples on how concrete security requirements can be described and tested
with the regard to the sample network product classes of clause 4.2. These
examples will be developed in Annex A for all proposed methodologies.\ Each
methodology can use its own list of requirements.
## 5.1 Methodology 1: Common Criteria (CC)
Editor\'s Note: The CC Management Board (CCMB) and the CC Development Board
(CCDB) have launched the update of the CCRA with new rules for the mutual
recognition of certificates across national certification schemes.
Applicability of these evolutions is FFS.
### 5.1.1 Introduction
The CC framework can be used as a model outside of the CCRA and this is what
methodology 1 intends to do.\ The roles used in this methodology are compliant
with the roles defined in clause 4.5.
Editor\'s note: The concrete role instantiation for Methodology 1 is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Methodology 1 needs to clarify how the generic process of
clause 4.5 (actors and roles) is meant to be implemented.
Editor\'s note: Methodology 1 needs to provide actionable details on which
part of the CC framework should be kept and for which activity of SECAM.
Editor\'s Note: The terminology used in all of clause 5.1 needs to be
harmonized. For example, the term \"evaluation activity\" and \"evaluation
techniques\" must be defined and used consistently.
This methodology is based on the well-established practice for specifying and
providing security assurance that has evolved over more than 20 years of
scrutiny from many of the best security assurance professionals.
The Common Criteria ISO/IEC 15408 [15] provides three different aspects:
\- It provides a common structure and language for expressing product security
requirements (CC Part 1), a catalogues of standardized security requirement
components and packages (CC Part 2 and 3)
\- It provides the concepts of Protection Profiles (security requirements for
network product classes) and Security Targets (security requirements for
network products that may or may not claim compliance to certain Protection
Profiles.
\- It also provides the methodology and framework (CC Part 3) for the
evaluation of products against known and understood requirements to gain
confidence in the effectiveness of the security measures.
Editor\'s note: Methodology 1 needs to explain how the operator gets assurance
of correct product implementation. E.g. through accreditation of the
development process or product certification.
Unlike its early predecessors such as TCSEC that specified the requirements
for a certain type of products, the CC framework is intentionally flexible,
allowing the evaluation of products with a wide range of security properties,
using different assurance methods. Over the years this has allowed the CC
framework to be used for many types of products and environments.
This flexibility also means that a security evaluation may be performed with
almost any product scope and for any type of security functionality. This
flexibility means that a security evaluation (and certification) may have a
very different content and qualities depending on the actual scope and
security requirements applied for a specific product evaluation. Therefore the
use of Protection Profiles is a way to ensure that different network products
will be assessed with at least a certain scope, security functionality and
security assurance requirements that is applicable to the network product
class to which the network product belong. It is good way to utilise and
control this flexibility that the CC framework gives us.
Below is a short description of the CC model, such the assurance model. This
description is to large extent extracted from the Common Criteria [15] and
adapted for the present document.
#### 5.1.1.2 Assurance paradigm
Necessary for the discussion of the benefits and using the Common Criteria
model is to understand the philosophy that underpins the CC approach to
assurance. An understanding of this will permit the reader to understand the
rationale behind the assurance requirements to better apply the CC model.
Critical for the understanding of the CC model is the concept of the Target Of
Evaluation (TOE).\ The TOE is the scope of the assessment (Target Of
Evaluation) that will provide security functionality.
Editor\'s Note: More details about the definition of the TOE needs to be
supplied.
The CC philosophy is that the threats to security and organisational security
policies (i.e. policy requirements) should be clearly articulated. These will
be translated into security objectives for the TOE and the TOE environment,
such as the TOE together with the TOE environment must be able to address all
the threats and organisational security policies. The TOE should then provide
the security measures called TSF (i.e. TOE Security Functions) and they must
be demonstrably sufficient to for their intended purpose, i.e. to satisfy the
TOE security objectives and thereby (together with the TOE environment) to
address all the threats and organisational security policies.
NOTE: For each TOE a preliminary threats analysis will be conducted. This
threat analysis will also take in to consideration the environment where the
TOE is deployed. The result of this threat analysis will be the security
requirements to select between all the ones listed by Protection Profile (PP)
or to add in a specific Security Target (ST). More details in clause 5.1.3.1.
#### 5.1.1.3 Assurance approach
The CC philosophy is to gaining assurance based upon an evaluation of the
product that is to be trusted. Evaluation has been the traditional means of
providing assurance and is the basis for prior evaluation criteria documents.
In aligning the existing approaches, the CC adopts the same philosophy. The CC
proposes measuring the validity of the documentation and of the resulting
product by expert evaluators with increasing emphasis on scope, depth, and
rigour.
Editor\'s Note: It needs to be clarified what documentation is intended and
how the expertise of the evaluator is ensured.
The CC framework does not exclude, nor does it comment upon, the relative
merits of other means of gaining assurance than the one described in CC Part 3
[15]. Research continues with respect to alternative ways of gaining
assurance.\ As mature alternative approaches emerge from these research
activities, they will be considered for inclusion in the CC, which allows the
new measures for gaining assurance to be used by the evaluators.
Assurance can be derived in many different ways. However, the CC framework
provides assurance through active investigation. Active investigation is an
evaluation of the product in order to determine its security properties.
Editor\'s note: More clarification on these active investigation activities is
needed.
One of the main purposes of the evaluation is therefore to active search for
potential vulnerabilities. This is done with the evaluation techniques
detailed in clause 5.1.4 such as the evaluation for the correctness of the
implementation of the network product.
Evaluation techniques can include, but are not limited to analysis of
development processes and procedures; analysis of design documentation;
analysis of guidance; analysis of develop testing; independent testing;
vulnerability analysis and penetration testing.
Unlike safety and quality control, the evaluation of the network product is a
means to gain assurance that the product is able to withstand accidental
threats (e.g., badly configured password policies) as well as intentional
attacks performed by hostile attackers.
The prime factor to consider when establishing confidence in security
countermeasures is trust in the source of the countermeasure. Therefore
particular attention shall be paid to the selection of the vendor or any other
entities involved in the development of the product.
#### 5.1.1.4 CC evaluation assurance scale
A core part of the CC philosophy is that greater evaluation effort results in
greater assurance. Another core part is that minimal effort should be applied
to provide the necessary level of assurance. The increasing level of effort is
based upon:
a) scope -- that is, the effort is greater because of a larger scope of the
evaluation aspects and evidence of the product is included;
b) depth -- that is, the effort is greater because it is deployed to a finer
level of design and implementation detail;
c) rigour -- that is, the effort is greater because it is applied in a more
structured, formal manner.
The CC defines seven different assurance levels. The Evaluation Assurance
Levels (EALs) provide an increasing scale that balances the level of assurance
obtained with the cost and feasibility of acquiring that degree of assurance.
Although the assurance requirements in CC part 3 are described one by one,
they are in most cases referred to as the package defined in an EAL. There is
nothing preventing authors of PPs or STs to add existing CC Part 3
requirements to an EAL (this is called augmentation) or to add new PP or ST
specific assurance requirements (this is called extended).
In many cases, in a Protection Profile (PP), existing assurance requirements
from CC part 3 are simply refined with additional detail on how testing or
vulnerability analysis should be performed, or what is required from the
design documentation (in addition to what CC requires). This is a good way for
the PP writer to be more specific.\ The refinements are considered to be valid
refinements as long as the existing assurance requirement has not been
weakened.
#### 5.1.1.5 CC assurance and the significance of vulnerabilities
It is assumed that there are threat agents that will actively seek to exploit
opportunities to violate the security objectives both for illicit gains and
for well-intentioned, but nonetheless insecure actions. Threat agents may also
accidentally trigger security vulnerabilities, causing harm to the
organisation. Security breaches arise through the intentional exploitation or
the unintentional triggering of vulnerabilities in the use of the product.
Vulnerabilities can arise through failures in:
a) requirements -- that is, an product may possess all the functions and
features required of it and still contain vulnerabilities that render it
unsuitable or ineffective with respect to security;
b) development -- that is, an product does not meet its specifications and/or
vulnerabilities have been introduced as a result of poor development standards
or incorrect design choices;
c) operation -- that is, an product has been constructed correctly to a
correct specification but vulnerabilities have been introduced as a result of
inadequate controls upon the operation.
Assurance is grounds for confidence that a network product meets its security
objectives (which were determined when the SCAS was written). This means that
the product provides the security functionality in such a way that they are
correct (as described) and effective (meet their purpose).
The vulnerability assessment activity (see clause 5.1.4) covers various
vulnerabilities that may be present in the development and operation of the
network product. This does not mean that the vulnerability assessment is a
continuous activity performed during the development or the operation.
Development vulnerabilities take advantage of some property of the product,
which was introduced during its development, e.g. defeating the self-
protection through tampering or defeating non-bypassability by circumventing
(bypassing) the security functions.\ Operational vulnerabilities take
advantage of weaknesses in non-technical countermeasures to violate the
security objectives, e.g. misuse or incorrect configuration. Misuse
investigates whether the product can be configured or used in a manner that is
insecure, but that an administrator or user of the product would reasonably
believe to be secure.
One of the main purposes of the evaluation is therefore to active search for
potential vulnerabilities.
This means that during all evaluation activities, using the information the
evaluator has to gain experience and understanding of the product, and
actively search for potential vulnerabilities (against the security
objectives) that may exist in the intended operation environment of the
product. In a separate vulnerability analysis activity the evaluator will try
to identify additional potential vulnerabilities and finally also assess
whether or not any of these potential vulnerabilities can be exploitable in
the intended operational environment. Some of the vulnerabilities may not be
exploitable at all, while other may be exploitable only with certain effort
(attack potential).
For a product to pass the evaluation there must be no known exploitable
vulnerabilities that can have a significant impact in the 3GPP context. This
means that the attack potential must be known and part of the intended
operational environment.
There are several factors determining the quality of the vulnerability
analysis. First, the ability to find vulnerabilities depends on the
availability of information of the product and its development environment
(e.g. design information, source code, delivery process, etc.). Second, the
rigour and formalism of the vulnerability analysis is also relevant to the
ability to find vulnerabilities. Third, each vulnerability has to be judged
against an attack potential to determine which of the vulnerabilities may be
considered exploitable and which may be considered residual (i.e. exploitable
only with an increased attack potential). These factors are determined by the
Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL).
#### 5.1.1.6 Concept of ST and PP
Since the CC framework in itself never indicates which security requirements a
certain security product or types of products shall meet, this has to be
specified. The Security Assurance Specification (SCAS) may specify any scope,
any Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and Security Assurance
Requirements (SARs) (see further clause 5.1.3.1). The CC framework requires
that the security specification follows a standardized format in order to:
\- ensure that specific content needed to assess a product against the
security specification is available;
\- allow comparison of ST of different products.
There are two types of specifications in CC: Protection Profiles (PPs) and
Security Targets (STs). The PP is the specification for a certain type of
product while the ST is the security specification for a specific product.
Such as there might be a PP for firewalls and a ST for Firewall XYZ. The ST
for the Firewall may claim compliance with the firewall PP. There may be
different PPs for different types of products or properties and one ST for a
product may claim compliance with none, one or multiple PPs.
The advantage of this is that it is possible to specify only the minimum
requirements in one PP for a certain type of products in one document, without
having to provide more details than necessary. At the same time it is possible
to ensure that vendors can claim compliance with the PP and also ensure that
the ST provides the additional informational to make it into a complete ST.
This means that a PP is less complete than an ST and has less detailed
information than an ST. The PP will never describe an implementation, but a PP
author may want to give more or less freedom to the implementation of the
security functionality. An ST may also extend the requirements beyond the
requirements in the PP.
The CC provides a catalogue of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and the
Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) in CC Part 2 and Part 3. The PP and ST
writers may use these catalogues to select the requirements for the PP and ST,
but may also define their own. However, it is not only very useful to rely on
the catalogue of SFRs since readers of STs will be familiar with these SFRs.
The CC also requires that new SFR should only be introduced if the available
SFR from CC Part 2 are not sufficient. There is also much experience and know-
how that has gone into these requirements. Still it is up the ST and PP writer
to select and instantiate (complete) the SFRs that are provided in CC Part 2.
Since both the PP and the ST are formal documents there are several different
guides available how to write these documents. In addition to the CC Part 1,
different guides are available. One example is the ISO/IEC TR 15446 \"Guide
for the production of Protection Profiles and Security Targets\".
#### 5.1.1.7 Specific issues on Protection Profiles (PPs) and Security Targets
(STs)
An ST is the security specification for a specific network product. The ST is
produced by the vendor and describes how the network product implements
security measures to fulfil the security requirements in the ST. The evaluator
performs an evaluation during which the evaluator determines whether the
network product fulfils the security requirements in the ST with the security
assurance level prescribed by the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) in
the ST.
The ST is compliant with a PP if the requirements in the ST are as strict as
or stricter than in the PP.
There are also requirements on PPs and STs. A PP must be complete, consistent
and technically sound and suitable for use as a template on which to build
another PP or an ST. In a similar way an ST must be complete, consistent and
technically sound and suitable for use as a basis for a TOE evaluation. This
is determined by the evaluation of PPs and STs. PP can be evaluated and
certified independent of any product, while the ST evaluation is only
performed as the first step in any TOE evaluation.
These strict requirements on PPs and STs will ensure the quality and
consistency. It has the benefit that unnecessary nice-to-have requirements
that do not really provide any increase in security can be easily avoided
since there must be a security objective behind all security requirements.
Having security requirements not relating to security objectives is less
likely to happen. The security objectives also require the appropriate threats
or organisational security policies. Also the PP and the ST are mainly
concerned with the TOE. Any parts that are outside of the TOE, i.e. the TOE
environment, are not subject to the same assessment. The development
environment is addressed by the Assurance measures for Life-Cycle (ALC) and
the operational environment is addressed by the guidance (AGD). Still they are
considered in the vulnerability analysis.
### 5.1.2 Content of a Security Assurance Specification (SCAS)
#### 5.1.2.1 Overview of SCAS
The purpose of a SCAS is to specify the overall security requirements for
network product classes. There will be one SCAS for each network product
class. An SCAS will consist of three different parts covering different
aspects:
\- A Protection Profile (PP), which specifies the scope of the Target Of
Evaluation (TOE), the security functional requirements and the assurance
requirements.
\- Software hardening requirement (e.g., disabling or removing unused network
services).
\- Hardware hardening requirements (e.g., disabling or removing unused
external ports).
The first part is covering the TOE, which means that should cover the security
functions of the network product class. The software and hardening
requirements are primarily to remove or reduce the attack surface of the
network product. Just as for the PP vs. ST relationship, the hardening
requirements consist of generic security objectives as well as instantiated
requirements.
NOTE 1: The split of documents between PP and hardening guidelines in
methodology 1 is made for documentation reasons and does not put weight on
this specific assurance activity.
Editor\'s note: The templates to use for these requirements are FFS.
Editor\'s note: The intention is to cover these hardening guidelines with
refinements of the AGD_PRE component. The concrete refinements of AGD_PRE for
this purpose are FFS.
Editor\'s note: Clarification on the scope of application on this software and
hardware hardening requirements and guidelines is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Concrete examples of hardening guidelines and their evaluation
are FFS.
The difference between the PP and the hardening requirements for software and
hardware may be illustrated as in the picture below.
Editor\'s note: in general the actors (e.g. evaluators vs. auditee, vendors
vs. third-party labs) and the phases in this methodology are FFS; consequently
who will assess compliance of OS/hardware against OS/hardware hardening
guidelines FFS.

Figure 5.1.2.1-1 Network product class and the security requirements
The software hardening guides may not limited to operating systems or COTS
products. Depending on the scope of the TOE it cannot be excluded that some
parts of the TOE that will be covered by hardening guides. However, the
hardening guides are addressing potential attack surfaces provided by these
parts and not any security functionality provided.
NOTE 2: The distinction between the software and hardware hardening guides is
not that they are restricted to hardware or software measures, but that they
are related to the hardware interfaces and software interfaces. This means
that deactivating a hardware interface may fulfil software hardening
requirements and vice versa.
Although, it is possible to have to have all SCAS requirements for a certain
network product class in one document, it may is also possible to have each
part in separate documents. By having separate documents it is easier to build
modular SCASs. Below is a description of each part.
Editor\'s note: It is important for the methodology how the information is
portioned in one or more documents. The best way to do it can be resolved once
SA3 has decided on a methodology.
NOTE 3: The assumption is that hardening guidelines are being verified.
#### 5.1.2.2 Description of the Protection Profile (PP) part
The concept of Protection Profiles was first developed with the Federal
Criteria in 1992. Since then it has been evolved with the Common Criteria and
the latest revision CC3.1R4 [15] is specifying the requited structure and
content in Part 1, Appendix B.
By following the standard and the latest version of the standard, it is
possible to take advantage of the on-going development of the standard. It
specifies the following clause of a PP:
1\. PP introduction -- Providing a narrative description of the product type
and its intended use, the scope of the TOE and its major security features.
2\. Conformance claims -- Stating whether the PP claims conformance to any
specific version of the CC, any specific PPs and/or packages (such as a
specific EAL).
3\. Security problem definition -- Identifying the threats, Organisational
Security Policies (OSPs) and assumptions that are relevant to the TOE.
4\. Security objectives -- Specifying how the security problem is addressed by
a division between security objectives for the TOE and security objectives for
the operational environment of the TOE.
5\. Extended components definition -- The definition of any extended
functional and assurance requirements, beyond the ones defined in CC Part 2 or
CC Part 3.
6\. Security requirements -- The applicable security requirements for the TOE,
i.e. the functional requirements as well as assurance requirements are given
here in this clause. They are the requirements that are necessary to meet the
security objectives for the TOE. These security requirements are using a
common and well-defined structure and language. These security requirements
may contain adaptions such as instantiations and refinement of the
requirements provided in the CC Part 2 and CC Part 3, as well as the extended
requirements in clause 5.
The most interesting part for 3GPP is probably clause 1, clause 3 and clause
6.
Clause 1 has to specify the network product class, the scope of the TOE,
summarise the security features, as well as the intended use. This clause is
essential for the rest of the PP.
Clause 3 defines the consensus of 3GPP regarding the assets to be protected,
the considered threats and the consensus on environment assumptions. It
implicitly relies on a further consensus regarding the attack paths that could
be used by an attacker to compromise assets on the TOE. All these elements
have to be defined within 3GPP before a PP can be defined.
Clause 6 specifies the security requirements. Although the generic functional
requirements may be taken from CC Part 2 or may be defined in clause 5, they
have to be instantiated and refined, at least to the extent that they are
meaningful to fulfil and still remain applicable to all network products of
the network product class.
3GPP could also have to clarify interpretation of requirements, e.g. in a
supporting document. Such activities are typically performed to help vendors
and evaluators to interpret Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) in a given
context, but also could be used to clarify some generic SFRs, e.g. SFRs
related to security policies in information flow control or security audit.
In the context of SECAM, it is not possible for vendors to add or remove in
the ST any security features or additional information to be evaluated.
An example of audit generation FAU_GEN.1.1 taken from the OSPP v3.9 [16] and
NDPP v1.1 [17]:
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | CC3.1R4 Part 2 | FAU_GEN.1.1 | | | | | | The TSF shall be able to generate an audit record | | | of the following auditable events: | | | | | | Start-up and shutdown of the audit functions; | | | | | | All auditable events for the [selection, choose | | | one of: _minimum, basic, detailed, not | | | specified_] level of audit; and | | | | | | [assignment: _other specifically defined | | | auditable events_]. | +----------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | OSPP v3.9 | FAU_GEN.1.1 | | | | | | The TSF shall be able to generate an audit record | | | of the following auditable events: | | | | | | Start-up and shutdown of the audit functions; | | | | | | All auditable events for the **not specified** | | | level of audit; and | | | | | | **all modifications to the set of events being | | | audited;** | | | | | | **all user authentication attempts;** | | | | | | **all denied accesses to objects for which the | | | access control policy defined in the OSPP base | | | applies;** | | | | | | **explicit modifications of access rights to | | | objects covered by the access control policies; | | | and** | | | | | | **other specifically defined auditable events as | | | defined in the table in FAU_GEN.1.2.** | +----------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | NDPP v1.1 | FAU_GEN.1.1 | | | | | | The TSF shall be able to generate an audit record | | | of the following auditable events: | | | | | | Start-up of the audit functions; | | | | | | All auditable events for the **not specified** | | | level of audit; and | | | | | | **All administrative actions;** | | | | | | **Specifically defined auditable events listed in | | | Table 1**. | | | | | | **Table 1 -- Auditable events and audit record | | | content:** | | | | | | **FIA_UIA_EXT.1 All use of the identification | | | and authentication mechanism. (Provided user | | | identity, origin of the attempt, e.g., IP | | | address).** | | | | | | **FPT_STM.1 Changes to the time. (The old and new | | | values for the time. Origin of the attempt, e.g., | | | IP address).** | | | | | | [...] | +----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
This means that the ST author may add additional auditable events to this
list. This may even be necessary if additional security features are included.
The assurance requirements, unlike the Security Functional Requirements
(SFRs), must not be refined. However, they can be refined by describing how a
certain network product class shall be documented or its security
functionality tested.
#### 5.1.2.3 Hardening
Editor\'s note: Details on what are the input/output and actors involved in
these hardening activities in the context of SECAM is FFS. Level of details of
the hardenings guideline issued by these different actors is also FFS.
The purpose of hardening is to contribute to reduce the attack surface of the
network product. This can be achieved by both software, and hardware and
configuration methods. Examples of software methods are to remove unnecessary
services and unused user accounts. An example of a hardware method is to
physically remove unused USB ports.\ An example of a configuration method is
to prevent the local access to an eNB.
Hardening is can be platform specific. For example hardening actions might
differ somewhat between different types of operating systems. Further,
hardware, operating systems and applications may be proprietary. This may or
may not affect what a SCAS list of concrete hardening actions can contain.
#### 5.1.2.4 Description of the software hardening part
The whole principle of hardening is not (only) to remove services or features
that are known to have vulnerabilities, but to identify and remove any
services or features that are not necessary and to reduce the remaining
services to the minimum required.
Software hardening is typically done for COTS products such as operating
systems and applications that may be installed with a lot of services and
features that are not necessary for the network product to run, and will
provide an attack surface.
On a high level the software hardening is divided into the identification of
unnecessary properties and features, and the elimination of them. For certain
products there may exist hardening guides that will help with the elimination
of them.
At the first level all external visible attack surface, functionality that is
not necessary for the network product must be identified. This can be done by
identifying services and processes, but also by testing which services are
visible on the external interfaces. Privileged applications (e.g. set user-ID
programs) are also considered to be potential risks and should be reduced to a
minimum of necessary services. Also configuration files must be analysed to
identify accounts, access rights and privileges and limited to the minimum
required.
There are two ways to deal with unwanted services and features. The first and
best is not to install them in the first place, since this will prevent them
from being activated later, by mistake or by an insider. The second approach
is to deactivate the service by changing the configuration. The second
approach will only be effective if these services cannot be activated by
unprivileged users or automatically, e.g. by restarting the system.
There is a third way to deal with unwanted services and features. This is to
make assumption or restrictions in how the product is supposed to be used.
This may include reducing the exposure to services by imposing firewalls or
filtering mechanisms in the environment of the network product.
For systems that are under maintenance it has to be ensured that the hardening
remains also after system maintenance or upgrade has been performed.
Editor\'s note: Clarification on the necessary adaptation on flaw remediation
process in CC to support system maintenance or upgrade for hardware and
software is FFS.
Experience has shown that upgrading or installation of applications may change
the hardening. Installation or even the installation process for installing
new applications may also require a deviation from the hardening. Sometimes
maintenance may require more functionality or access rights to the users
performing maintenance. All services interfaces are very good attack surface
candidates.
#### 5.1.2.5 Description of the hardware hardening part
Hardware hardening is on a high, principal level, very similar to software
hardening. An attack surface is an attack surface independent of it is a
hardware or software interface. However, a physical access may limit the
possible attackers. Also the steps and security measures taken in hardening
are different.
#### 5.1.2.6 Definition of the expected environment of the network product
class in the context of writing the 3GPP evaluation profile
There are certain aspects of the operational environment for a network product
that are relevant for security.\ The relevant aspects are divided into threats
that have to be addressed (by the network product) and needs on the
environment from the network product in order to effectively address these
threats. These needs are formulated as assumption on the environment that has
to be fulfilled. In addition to the threats the environment may have policies
resulting in security requirements on the network product. These policies are
called organisational security policies.\ In addition to the threats there is
also an assumed attack potential to an attacker behind the identified threats.
By having a well-defined description of the environment it will be possible to
identify if there exist additional threats that are relevant, if there is an
attack potential that is beyond the one assumed, or if it is not possible to
meet the assumptions, i.e. to satisfy the need of the network product class.
### 5.1.3 Methodology for development of a SCAS
#### 5.1.3.1 Overview
One should not believe that a PP is enough to enable evaluation within 3GPP
actors. It should be noted that many communities using CC evaluation as a
standard also heavily rely to ad-hoc supporting documentation.
Example of this can be found in smartcard community, which had to issue
\- specific guidelines refining almost all CC assurance components
\- refinements on CEM, such as the application of \"attack potential\"
\- etc.
Considering that at present time, many ITSEFs and local certification bodies
do not have the required skills to assess specific notions or protocols used
in the network products within the copse of SECAM, there is also a need for
non-public shared documentation describing
\- the expected skills of evaluators,
\- the consensus on attacks paths and methods that should be verified during
AVA_VAN evaluation,
\- etc.
It is impossible to conclude that CC is cost effective without a complete list
of the needed supporting documents.
Editor\'s note: The complete list of expected CC supporting document is FFS,
as well as the description of the evaluation process (roles, actors, steps and
so on).
Editor\'s note: There is a need for more explanation on the identification and
mapping between the security threats, security objectives. Which parts of CC
document provide this clarification and how to reuse it is FFS.
#### 5.1.3.2 How to identify suitable SFRs and SARs for the PP
There are several good documents describing how to write Protection Profiles
(and also Security Targets). First of all there is the ISO Technical Report
ISO/IEC TR 15446:2009, but there are also different national documents
describing this.
Although the methodology usually is presented as a top-down method, writing a
PP is always an iterative process.\ It is useful to start with a general
problem description, written in natural language. This is usually more helpful
than any formalism since it will establish a general understanding of the
security problem and its solution before starting the more formal work.
The steps are following the structure of the clauses in the PP, but with
iterations and repeated refinements.\ The formal parts can be summarised in
the following steps:
\- threat analysis;
\- the security problem is first defined based on the threat analysis;
\- the security objectives are then identified to address the security
problem;
\- security requirements are then defined to satisfy the security objectives
for the TOE;
\- actual security functions are then selected to satisfy the security
requirements.
Usually, an iterative process will be required. For example, definition of
security requirements may highlight clarifications needed to the definition of
the security objectives or even the security problem. In general, a number of
iterations may be required in which the relationships between threats,
organisational security policies, security objectives and security
requirements and functions are examined closely, particularly when rationales
are being constructed. Only when all identified gaps in the rationales are
filled may it be assumed that the PP is complete.
#### 5.1.3.3 How to help vendors and evaluators to use the PP
Editor\'s note: There is a need for further explanation and adaptation of CC
for specific 3GPP context. In particular:
\- What are the typical evidences one should use for design documentation?
(ADV_*)
\- What are the baseline methodological requirements for compliance tests
(ATE)?
\- What are the state-of-the-art vulnerability tests for AVA_VAN?
\- What types of configuration and test beds are allowed for third-party test
(ATE_IND) and AVA_VAN?
\- What is the 3GPP understanding of user guidance? (e.g. will the hardening
guidelines be part of user guidance?)
### 5.1.4 Evaluation of a network product against a SCAS
Using the methodology provided with Common Criteria there are security
assurance requirements, provided by CC Part 3 and packaged in evaluation
assurance levels or explicitly stated requirements described by the PP (or
even ST).
The security concept is the confidence in countermeasures, and that this
confidence is achieved by evaluation (picture taken from CC Part 1)
{width="5.479166666666667in" height="3.6041666666666665in"}
Figure 5.1.4-1: CC security concept
This assurance can be derived in many different ways. However, the CC provides
assurance through active investigation of an evaluator. Active investigation
is an evaluation of the IT product in order to verify that the countermeasures
are correct and effective (sufficient). One of the main purposes of the
evaluation is therefore to active search for potential vulnerabilities.
The evaluation techniques described by the CC include, but are not limited to:
a) analysis and checking of process(es) and procedure(s);
b) checking that process(es) and procedure(s) are being applied;
c) analysis of the correspondence between TOE design representations;
d) analysis of the TOE design representation against the requirements;
e) verification of proofs;
f) analysis of guidance documents;
g) analysis of functional tests developed and the results provided;
h) independent functional testing;
i) analysis for vulnerabilities (including flaw hypothesis);
j) penetration testing.
Editor\'s note: Providing an average level of assurance expected by
methodology 1 for the above mentioned evaluation techniques in the context of
SECAM is FFS.
Which of these evaluation techniques defined by 3GPP that should be applied
and when, is determined by the assurance requirements. These assurance
requirements specifies what the developer shall provide or do (D), the content
and presentation of any provided documentation (C) and what the evaluator
shall do to verify this (E).\ E.g., development security (ALC_DVS) is
concerned with the developer\'s physical, procedural, personnel, and other
security measures. There are no ALC_DVS requirements for EAL1 and EAL2,
ALC_DVS.1 (identification of security measures) is part of EAL3 to EAL5, while
ALC_DVS.2 is for EAL6 and EAL7. Using at ALC_DVS.1 as an example:
\- ALC_DVS.1.1D -- The developer shall produce and provide development
security documentation.
\- ALC_DVS.1.1C -- The development security documentation shall describe all
the physical, procedural, personnel, and other security measures that are
necessary to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the TOE design and
implementation in its development environment.
\- ALC_DVS.1.1E -- The evaluator shall confirm that the information provided
meets all requirements for content and presentation of evidence.
\- ALC_DVS.1.2E -- The evaluator shall confirm that the security measures are
being applied.
This means that security assurance measures specify **what** the developer has
to provide and **what** evaluator shall do. The details **how** the evaluator
shall do this and how to document this is documented in the CEM (the CC
Evaluation Methodology). CEM identifies work units for the evaluator. This
means that for ALC_DVS.1 there are the following work units described in CEM:
\- ALC_DVS.1-1 The evaluator shall examine the development security
documentation to determine that it details all security measures used in the
development environment that are necessary to protect the confidentiality and
integrity of the TOE design and implementation. (Related to ALC_DVS.1.1E)
\- ALC_DVS.1-2 The evaluator shall examine the development confidentiality and
integrity policies in order to determine the sufficiency of the security
measures employed. (Related to ALC_DVS.1.1E)
\- ALC_DVS.1-3 The evaluator shall examine the development security
documentation and associated evidence to determine that the security measures
are being applied. (Related to ALC_DVS.1.2E)
These assurance requirements may be extended or refined as is happening in the
NIAP PPs by providing more details in the assurance measures. E.g., it is
possible to change ALC_DVS.1.1C to require specific information to be covered
by the security documentation, such as requirement on having an alarm system,
doing background check of developers, etc. If there are completely new
assurance requirements developed, there is also a need for providing the
equivalent CEM information for how these requirements shall be verified.
# 5.2 Methodology 2
### 5.2.1 Overview
Each 3GPP network product class listed in clause 4.4 can have vulnerabilities
which, if exploited, can damage the MNO and/or end-users. In order to
understand the potential attack vectors which could be used, the first thing
to do is to identify the targets of the analysis. This methodology assumes the
3GPP network product classes listed in clause 4.4 as the targets.
Each 3GPP network product, within a network product class, is basically a
device composed of hardware (e.g. chip, processors, RAM, network cards) and
software (e.g. operating system, drivers, applications, services, protocols);
in addition the 3GPP network product can be managed and configured locally
and/or remotely. All these features can expose the 3GPP network product to
several potential security attacks. If the network product is securely
implemented, managed and configured then some of these attacks can be
prevented. The above mentioned security attacks can exploit different 3GPP
network product features/ capabilities.
A pre-requisite for the SCAS writing part of methodology 2 is to have a
complete list of features/capabilities considered relevant by SA3 for
evaluation. The final list of features/capabilities and consequently the list
of security requirements will depend on the results of a threat analysis done
in the normative phase of this study.
SECAM evaluation will cover the following four tasks:
\- Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management
process assurance compliance (assessing if the method used to develop the
products is compliant with the Security Assurance Process)
\- Security Compliance Testing (assessing if requested security requirements
are correctly implemented in a network product)
\- Basic Vulnerability Testing (running of a set of FOSS/COTS tools on
external interfaces of the Network product)
\- Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis (holistic approach to analyse risk and
impact of Vulnerabilities found in the Network Product))
The actor performing a task shall be accredited by the SECAM Accreditation
Body for this specific task.
Table 1 Mapping between SECAM phases and involved party.
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | SECAM tasks | Accredited actor | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Vendor network product | Accredited vendor | | development and | | | | | | network product lifecycle | | | management | | | | | | process assurance compliance | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Security compliance testing | Accredited vendor or accredited | | | third-party evaluator | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Basic Vulnerability Testing | Accredited vendor or accredited | | | third-party evaluator | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis | Accredited vendor or accredited | | | third-party evaluator | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
Consequently, according to table 1, SECAM can take many forms, depending on
who performs security compliance testing, who performs Basic Vulnerability
Testing and who performs Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis (EVA).\ SECAM is
intended to enable self-evaluation where the vendors evaluate their network
products if they have the proper accreditation for that. Methodology 2
provides all provisions for this need.
In Methodology 2 the responsibility for writing and managing the accreditation
and monitoring rules is taken by a SECAM Accreditation Body. SECAM
Accreditation Body\'s role also includes the handling of the dispute process.
Methodology 2 will propose GSMA for taking this role and will provide a clear
delineation between SECAM work in 3GPP and SECAM-related work in GSMA.
Even if it describes the complete process, including evaluation by accredited
actors under SECAM Accreditation Body control and Security Assurance
Specifications (SCAS) writing, Methodology 2 does not prevent that 3GPP SCAS
security requirements and tests cases are used directly by mutual consent
between vendors and operators without the accreditation process in place if
wished so. This ensures that the 3GPP SECAM work is not held up by delays in
deliverables under the responsibility of external bodies, or by conflicting
requirements in different countries (e.g. relating to accreditation).
The presence of a SECAM Accreditation body as defined above is highly
desirable in order to ensure a wide recognition of evaluation results and to
have a working conflict resolution process available. Having a SECAM
Accreditation Body also avoids the need for each operator to set up a one to
one trust relationship with every vendor regarding their testing methods and
skills.
Accreditation is intended to be valid for a limited time period and repeated
at a frequency defined by the SECAM Accreditation Body (see clause 5.2.3 for
details).
The ultimate output of the SECAM process is:
\- an evaluation report proving compliance of a 3GPP network product with the
3GPP security assurance specifications
\- optionally a certificate proving the accreditation of actors performing the
evaluation tasks
An evaluation report will be issued for each 3GPP network product evaluated,
and an optional certificate will be maintained for each actor.
The operator examines the network product, the compliance reports and the
testing laboratories certificate published by the SECAM Accreditation Body and
decides if the results are sufficient according to its internal policies (see
5.2.6 for details on Operators\' security acceptance decision).
Below are several examples of instantiation of roles for SECAM:
**Example 1: Combination of self-evaluation (for security compliance) and
third-party evaluation (for basic vulnerability testing and enhanced
vulnerability analysis) for the evaluation of a 3GPP network product (e.g. MME
A of vendor X)**
In the example below:
\- Vendor development process assurance compliance is self-assessed by a
vendor, which has previously been accredited by the SECAM Accreditation Body
for this task. This assessment covers Life cycle management of the network
product (e.g. control of update in development ...). More details on these
aspects are in clause 5.2.2.3.
\- Security compliance testing is self-assessed by a vendor, which has
previously been accredited by the SECAM Accreditation Body for this task;
\- Basic Vulnerability Testing is self-assessed by a vendor, which has
previously been accredited by the SECAM Accreditation Body for this task;
\- Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis is assessed by an accredited third-party
laboratory which has previously been accredited by the SECAM Accreditation
Body for this task.
\- The operators, and the vendors as far as third parties are concerned,
receive the report from all four tasks of the evaluation and the vendor\'s
self-declaration for a given network product and are able to check that all
involved parties (self-evaluating vendors and/or 3^rd^ party evaluators) were
accredited to undertake the tests by checking their accreditation with the
SECAM Accreditation Body.

Figure 5.2.1-1: Combination of self-evaluation for security compliance and\
basic vulnerability testing and third-party evaluation for Enhanced
Vulnerability Analysis\ for the evaluation of a 3GPP network product (e.g. MME
A of vendor X)
**Example 2: Complete self-evaluation of a 3GPP network product (e.g. eNodeB B
from vendor Y)**
This second example below is similar to the first one except that the vendor
is also accredited to undertake Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis and thus
conduct all the three phases of evaluation.
{width="6.690277777777778in" height="3.9680555555555554in"}
Figure 5.2.1-2: Complete self-evaluation of a 3GPP network product\ (e.g.
eNodeB B from vendor Y)
**Evaluation results check by the operators and dispute**
The operator does not need to be accredited to perform again the tests made by
the evaluators in order to gain a higher level of assurance that the SECAM
evaluation provided trustable results. Definition of the tools and methods for
these supplementary evaluations is outside of the scope of SECAM and left as
operators\' proprietary procedures.
However, in case of disagreement on the test results and if the operator wants
to enter a conflict resolution process with the SECAM Accreditation Body and
the vendor, some forms of recognition of the validity of the operators
complaint might be useful. This description will be part of the description of
the complete dispute resolution process is likely to be left to the SECAM
Accreditation Body and will be outside of the scope of 3GPP. For more details
see clause 5.2.7.2.
### 5.2.2 Methodology building
#### 5.2.2.1 Overview
SECAM methodology building is described in figure 5.2.2.1-1 hereafter. First,
3GPP will undertake a threat analysis and then will derive the SCAS for each
identified network product class as well as one security assurance process
document. The security assurance process document will describe the whole
security assurance process (evaluation, relation to accreditation body,
general description of desired assurance level ...).
Editor\'s note: Clarification on how these documents will be mapped to 3gpp
documents (TS, TR 33.9bb -- Technical Reports intended for publication ...) is
FFS.
The SCAS will contain the detailed security requirements identified by SA3 to
reduce/counteract the risks outlined by the threat analysis as well as a
description of the test cases and where possible with expected test results.
NOTE 1: The security requirements contained in an SCAS are security functional
requirements in the sense of Common Criteria [15], or hardening requirements.
Security assurance requirements in the sense of Common Criteria [15] are
embodied in the test cases and test results of an SCAS.\ There are no other
security assurance requirements in an SCAS, apart from the test cases and test
results, and, hence, there is no separate testing against any security
assurance requirements when testing for compliance with an SCAS.\ There are,
however, tests against vendor development process assurance requirements, cf.
clause 5.2.2.3.
NOTE 2: The number of documents to be delivered by SA3 will depend on the
grouping chosen for the SCAS.
The definition of the security requirements to use during the security
compliance task will be conducted during the normative phase. The definition
of the requirements to use for the basic vulnerability testing and enhanced
vulnerability analysis tasks will also be conducted during the normative
phase.
More details on how these security requirements are organized, collected and
used to define a SCAS for a specific Network Product Class are supplied in
clause 5.2.2.4.
Once the SCASs are ready, they will be used to define, when necessary, the
expected test methodology for each security requirement in a dedicated
document (for security compliance testing, basic vulnerability testing and
enhanced vulnerability analysis tasks). This test methodology and skills
requirements document is complementary to the expected output of the test
cases defined in the SCAS and should help the evaluators providing guidance on
how to conduct these tests where necessary. This test methodology document
will also define the expected skills and tools for testing laboratories
(especially for Basic Vulnerability Testing and Enhanced Vulnerability
Analysis).\ Having an evaluation guidance document will help to ensure that
the SECAM evaluations s can be compared to each other in the sense that a
similar set of tools and techniques will be applied to produce the test
outputs.\ Besides, the \"test methodology and skills requirements\" document
can be used by SECAM Accreditation Body as criteria to judge whether a tester
has the necessary test skills required by the tests and then used to accredit
the testers.
The SECAM Accreditation Body will define the administrative rules guiding the
future evaluations (accreditation scheme for evaluators, dispute process).
NOTE 3: The detailed results of the testing from a network product are not
expected to be public.\ These results will be given to the operators upon
request to the vendors and might also be requested by the SECAM Accreditation
Body for resolution of dispute cases.

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: Successive activities for \"Methodology 2\" building
The writing of the security assurance process related document which will
include Vendor Development Process Assurance requirements is detailed in
clause 5.2.2.3. Clause 5.2.2.4 details the writing of the Security Assurance
Specification documents which are used as input in the evaluation tasks.
The output of the security compliance task is detailed in clause 5.2.4.3. The
output of the Basic Vulnerability Testing task is detailed in clause 5.2.4.4.
The output of the Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis task is detailed in clause
5.2.4.5.
#### 5.2.2.2 Security assurance process document creation
The security assurance process document will define the complete SECAM
evaluation process (evaluation, relation to SECAM Accreditation Body, roles
...) as well as the components of SECAM that are intended to provide the
expected security assurance. It will thus describe for example the different
evaluation tasks (vendor network product development and network product
lifecycle management process assessment, Security Compliance Testing, Basic
Vulnerability Testing and Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis) and the different
actors involved. This document will help all involved parties to have a clear
understanding of the overall process and the covered threats.
The concrete security requirements will be part of the SCASs for each network
product class and not part of this overall process document. The same applies
for vendor network product development and network product lifecycle
management process requirements which will also be developed in a dedicated
document (see clause 5.2.2.3).
In particular, during the normative phase, for each network product class
there may be more than one document that applies to a given network product
class. The documents contain different SCAS modules as discussed in clause
4.1.3. Some SCAS modules will serve as the reference document for security
compliance testing while other SCAS modules will serve as reference for the
Basic Vulnerability Testing and Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis.
#### 5.2.2.3 Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle
management process document creation
Life cycle management consists in establishing discipline and control in the
updates of network product during its development and maintenance. Life cycle
management controls are important during normal improvement of network product
as well as for vulnerability/security flaw remediation (documentation used to
track vulnerability/security flaw, remediation procedure with relation to
corrective actions for each identified the vulnerability/security flaw...).\
The vendor accreditation for network product development and network product
life cycle management process will provide assurance for these aspects in
SECAM.
Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management
process assurance requirements as well as related evaluation activities
generic to all network product classes will be developed in a dedicated
document.\ The requirements and evaluation activities for this task will be
specified by the SECAM Accreditation Body; however Annex E of this document
already provides an example set of requirements covering the four aspects
below that could be included in the Vendor network product development and
network product lifecycle management process assurance task:
\- Version and Configuration Management;
\- Flaw remediation;
\- Process to ensure code quality;
\- Vendors\' development site protection.
The exact list of what categories have to be covered will be defined in the
normative phase.
NOTE 1: Required and acceptable evidence needs to be defined in the normative
phase to ensure comparability. Annex E describes concrete examples of
requirements to cover these aspects with a list of required and acceptable
evidences to ensure comparability
NOTE 2: Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle
management process security quality is not a 3GPP/Telecom specific issue. The
assumption is that for the normative phase, as much as possible from existing
standards should be reused. During the normative phase four aspects could be
covered (Version and Configuration Management, Flaw remediation, Process to
ensure code quality and Vendor\'s development sites protection). Overall,
similarly to the CPA Build Standard presented as example in Annex E, the
number of requirements will have to be relatively small (an order of magnitude
of 10) to keep evaluation cost reasonable and focus on critical controls.
#### 5.2.2.4 Security Assurance Specification (SCAS) creation
##### 5.2.2.4.1 Writing process overview
An SCAS document will be defined for a specific network product class within
the normative phase. On a high level, the process of writing a SCAS document
for a given network product class follows these steps:
**\- Describe and model the network product class\** I.e. the network product
class shall be described and modelled to a sufficiently detailed level so as
to ensure that the security requirements can clearly describe what data and
functions are intended to be protected and which functionalities are required.
This modelling will be used as an input document for the following Security
Problem Definition.
**\- Define the security problem** \ By identifying which assets in the model
of the network product class require protection and how these assets can be
exploited by an attacker. The security problem definition also contains the
security objectives of the network product class under analysis (i.e., which
assets require what type of protection), and defines an attacker potential the
network product class is supposed to resist. This step also contains the
threat analysis employed to understand how an attacker performing the
identified potential attacks may misuse the identified assets of the network
product class. This provides a concrete security problem that is to be solved,
which allows selection of security requirements that are necessary and
sufficient to solve the identified security problem.
**\- Identify the security requirements and test cases** \ Security
requirements are derived from the security problem definition. The fulfilment
of these requirements ensures that the security objectives can be reached. CC
part 2 [15] document will be used as a reference catalogue of security
requirements and security requirement categories as a starting point to help
SA3 in writing complete requirements.\ These requirements can and will be
modified and adapted as seen necessary by SA3.\ SA3 will not be bound to the
format of security requirements defined in CC part 2 (class, families,
components...) and will be free for example to embed several dependencies of a
security requirement directly in the requirement itself to ease readability
and test case writing. Furthermore, 3GPP is not limited to modifying or
adapting security requirements from CC part 2 [15] and may formulate their own
security requirements when no suitable counterpart in [15] is found. When
doing so care needs to be taken with respect to clarity, dependencies, and
events to be logged, cf. also the following paragraphs. Further, when doing
so, a rationale shall be provided explaining why it was necessary to deviate.
It will be determined in the normative phase in which document rationales will
be captured.\ \ In addition, if requirements, or terminology used to specify
the requirements, are not clear or consistent there is an increased risk of
different understanding of the requirements and this may unnecessarily result
in heavy use of the dispute resolution process. For example if a requirement
applies on the \"management traffic\", a clear definition on what the
\"management traffic\" consist of would be needed. This could be in particular
a difficulty for tests that consist of verifying whether a requirement is
fulfilled by examining documentation and making a decision on whether the
designed mechanism or used process fulfils the requirement; such tests are a
judgment call and can be called differently by different parties.\ \
Compliance with a CC protection profile format is not a goal as such, where it
will be more efficient to deviate from it, SA3 will do so. The consistency of
the requirements format is ensured by the template for a security requirement
described in clause 5.2.2.4.2.3.3 hereafter.\ \ Security requirements in CC
part 2 have dependencies between each other. For example, FMT_SMR.2 requires
that there are restrictions on user-roles handling security functions. That is
dependent on that also the security requirement FMT_SMR.1 is included.
FMT_SMR.1 requires that there are roles defined for handling security
sensitive assets (i.e., not everything is run as the root-user on *nix-like
systems). These dependencies information will help SA3 to write sound
requirements and should generally be included. There should be a rationale
given for when modifications to the CC security requirements are required
(e.g. removing a dependency). For each security requirement SA3 will define a
test case.
**\- Verify the Security Requirements\** Once the security requirements have
been identified it is verified that the security objectives are met by these
security requirements, and that every security requirement contributes to
defending an identified security objective. If any mismatch is found (e.g.
security objective not covered with the existing security requirements or
security requirements which don\'t resolve any security objectives), the list
of security requirements shall be updated accordingly by removing or adding
security requirements.
##### 5.2.2.4.2 SCAS document structure and content
##### 5.2.2.4.2.1 General {#general .H6}
The SCAS document contains three parts, a Network Product Class Description, a
Security Problem Definition and the Security Requirements (including the test
cases) for this specific Network Product Class [see clause 3.1], identified by
SA3 to counteract the risks outlined by the threat analysis. Consequently each
SCAS document shall contain the following clauses:
_**\- Network Product Class Description (NPCD)** :_ This clause includes the
description of the network product class, e.g. the physical and logical
interfaces the product class supports to interact with external entities and
the major functionalities of the NPC.
**_\- Security Problem Definition (SPD)_** : This clause defines the security
problem that is to be addressed and the security objectives of the network
product class.
**_\- Security Requirements (SR)_** : This clause defines the security
requirements, which may include hardening requirements, selected according to
the Security Problem Definition and the requirements strictly related to the
3GPP features implemented by the network product class under analysis.
> In the following a detailed description of each SCAS clause is provided.
NOTE: References are made when analogous CC part 2 [15] requirements exist.
The requirements in CC have names that follow this name format XYZ_VWU.n.mx.
When the text below references the CC requirements that format is used, for
example FMT_SMR.2.
##### 5.2.2.4.2.2 Security Problem Definition (SPD) {#security-problem-
definition-spd .H6}
For the Security Problem Definition clause of the SCAS writing phase, the
steps to be accomplished by 3GPP SA3 for a given network product class will be
to:
\- List the critical assets of the network product class;
\- Identify the external interfaces of this class;
\- List the assumptions on the Operational Environment;
\- Identify the attacker model for the Network Product Class;
\- Identify threats, i.e. adverse actions than can be performed on assets;
\- Identify the level of risk associated with the threats;
\- Identify the list of the security objectives necessary to face the
identified threats and reduce the risk surface.
For features that are standardized in 3GPP specifications some threat analyses
are available from 3GPP Technical Reports (e.g. TR 33.821 for EPS [20]) or
other publications. In particular, threat analyses related to the security
requirements in 3GPP TSs to be re-used in SECAM, cf. clause 5.2.2.4.2.3.2,
need not be repeated in SECAM. These were however written before e.g. current
SECAM type of work objectives came to light.
NOTE: For features that are (to some degree) proprietary and, hence, not
(fully) standardized, a way of describing them in a general way needs to be
found as, by their nature, no common understanding is generally available to
the public. Without a general description of a feature, it may be difficult to
perform a threat and risk analysis on it.
There are also many threat and risks analysis or modelling frameworks
available for IT equipment and computers networks. None of them is likely to
perfectly fit the needs of SECAM which ultimate goal is to be capable to
derive concrete and testable security requirements to reduce the level of
exposure of telecom equipment.
This process is likely to be iterative and there will be some trade-off in
terms of time. It is not a goal to be absolutely complete in the threats
assessment. What ultimately matters in the threat analysis phase is that the
SA3 group gets the feeling that the achieved level of details is good enough
to be able to easily derive testable security requirements to cover the risks
in a reasonable amount of time.
Whatever the approach that will be chosen, the structure for this clause is
provided to indicate the information needed for having a clear security
problem definition. This can help to facilitate the identification of the
security requirements. Hereafter a possible structure for the threats, risks
and security objectives which are part of the SPD is reported. This structure
will be related to the threat modelling framework used for the analysis and
consequently this proposal could be changed accordingly.
_\- Threat Reference_ : a unique short form is assigned to each threat as a
primary means for referencing the threat. The convention adopted is: \ \- \ where the convention adopted for the
\"threat category\" can be the first two letters of the category to which the
threat belongs or similar.
_\- Threat Category_ : a reference to the category to which the threat belong
based on the classification (threat methodology) that will be adopted
_\- Threat Description_ : the adverse actions than can be performed by a
threat agent on an asset. These actions influence one or more properties of
the asset from which that asset derives its value. Examples of threat agents
are hackers, users, computer processes, and accidents. Threat agents, and
their level, may be further described by aspects such as expertise, resources,
opportunity and motivation. To provide a basis for requirements that are on
roughly the same level, SA3 shall choose a level of threat agents that the
system should be able to withstand (although the levels may be hard to
quantify or measure). Protection mechanisms or requirements shall then not be
selected if a threat can be instantiated only by a threat agent of higher
level. This is in line with the single assurance level and single security
baseline per network product class of clause 4.5.2.2 and 4.5.2.3.
_\- Asset_ : an indication of the network product assets object of the threat
_\- Risk:_ a level of the risk related to the specific threat
\- _Security Objectives_ : a concise and abstract statement that counter the
identified threats. These security objectives shall be used to select the
proper security requirements for the network product class under evaluation.
The security objectives shall be on roughly the same abstraction level.
##### 5.2.2.4.2.3 Security Requirements {#security-requirements .H6}
##### 5.2.2.4.2.3.1 Introduction {#introduction-2 .H6}
3GPP SA3 will have to list the countermeasures deemed relevant to mitigate the
risks identified in the threat assessment. These countermeasures will take the
form of either:
\- security requirements with associated test cases (as defined by the chosen
methodology for SECAM)
\- or operational environment assumptions that could also be documented in
SCAS for a given product class
The Security Requirements within the SCAS document shall contain the security
requirements identified according to the threats (see Figure 5.2.2.4.2.3.1-1).
{width="5.021527777777778in" height="5.167361111111111in"}
Figure 5.2.2.4.2.3.1-1: Process for deriving security compliance requirements
in a SCAS document
The security requirements will include security functional requirements as
well as hardening requirements. The security functional requirements are
ensuring the existence of security functionalities in the network products in
order to achieve security objectives (e.g. 3GPP functional requirements). The
hardening requirements are either ensuring the absence of unneeded or insecure
functionality, or impose a restriction on a function forcing it to behave in a
more secure way.
The purpose of hardening is to reduce the attack surface and security
vulnerability of the network product and to ensure that security functions of
the network product cannot be bypassed. SECAM will specify hardening
requirements that should be part of the evaluation. Those requirements are
only intended to reduce the attack surface rather than directly related to a
security function. All security requirements, those related to a specific
security function as well as those related to the reduction of the attack
surface, will be treated on the same footing and the text of clause
5.2.2.4.2.3 applies to both \"types\" of requirements. Their evaluation will
be based on the tests cases of the SCAS. In any case, hardening requirements
test cases will imply that they must be implemented before evaluation.
Hardening requirements should be formulated generic enough, or in different
variants, to be applicable for a variety of anticipated
OSs/applications/systems. Hardening is needed to let network products achieve
the given security baseline and assurance level, alongside with other security
functional requirements.
Hardening can be the removal of services, protocols, ports, etc, in order to
reduce known security vulnerabilities and minimise the risk in an existing but
unneeded functionality. An example of hardening is to remove unnecessary
services of general purpose software used in a specific context. It can also
be a physical action like removing unneeded USB ports. An example of such a
requirement is provided at the end of clause 5.2.2.4.2.3.3.
SECAM security requirements represent the common agreement on operators and
vendors on what has to be implemented for a given network product class to
achieve the required security baseline. All those requirements (including
operator\'s initialisation and configuration requirements which have been
channelled through the relevant SECAM standardization processes) have to be
taken into account from the beginning of the development and design phase of
the network product as well as in subsequent updates of the network product.
This will ensure that network products will be developed in a way that
a) Maximizes their likelihood to pass SECAM evaluation
b) They operate correctly and securely when deployed in operator\'s networks
c) Avoids costly patching cycle to ensure a) and b)
##### 5.2.2.4.2.3.2 Incorporation of security requirements from existing 3GPP
TSs in current releases {#incorporation-of-security-requirements-from-
existing-3gpp-tss-in-current-releases .H6}
In Figure 5.2.2.4.2.3.1-1, 3GPP specifications represent an input for both SPD
and Security Requirements and test case definition. The reason of this
assumption is that 3GPP security specifications (e.g. TS 33.401 [8]) already
contain several security objectives and relative security requirements which
SA3 identified when designing UMTS and LTE. When looking at such type of
security requirements, they can be grouped into three categories:
1) Security requirements related to protocols and behaviours necessary for
secure interoperability between nodes from different vendors that require a
certain positive behaviour of a 3GPP function.\ For example, the requirement
\"The UE shall provide its equipment identifier IMEI or IMEISV to the network,
if the network asks for it in an integrity-protected request\" retrieved from
TS 33.401, belongs to this category.
2) Security requirements related to protocols and behaviours necessary for
secure interoperability between nodes from different vendors that require that
a 3GPP function does not perform a certain action.\ For example, the
requirement \"The UE shall not send IMEI or IMEISV to the network on a network
request before the NAS security has been activated\" retrieved from TS 33.401
belongs to this category.
3) Security requirements not related to protocols and behaviours necessary for
secure interoperability between nodes from different vendors, but rather deal
with security features which shall be supported by the network products and
consequently strictly related to their implementation.\ For example, the
requirement specified in clause 5.3 of TS 33.401 for eNBs and in annex I of TS
33.102 [21] for RNCs in exposed locations belong to this category.
The security requirements in the first group are already covered by the
interoperability and conformance testing and SECAM documents shall not repeat
these requirements or add tests for them.
The security requirements in the second category may not be covered by the
interoperability and conformance testing. In this case a SCAS document might
contain a reference to these requirements with the relative test cases which
verify that the network products are adhered to.
The security requirements in the third category are within the scope of SECAM
and they will be taken into account in the Security Compliance Requirements. A
security requirement retrieved from a 3GPP TS shall refer the relative TS
requirement and shall also contain a test description to verify the correct
implementation of the described security features (e.g. authentication and
authorization for eNB settings and software configuration changes via local or
remote access, key management requirements for the session keying material and
long term keys used for authentication and security association setup purposes
handled by eNBs, secure environment for eNB).
##### 5.2.2.4.2.3.3 Handling of security requirements {#handling-of-security-
requirements .H6}
A SECAM Catalogue of SRs is used as input for Security Requirements and test
case definition task. The SECAM Catalogue of SRs has been introduce because it
is likely that several network product classes will share very similar if not
identical security requirements for some aspects. In order to maximize the
reuse of already written requirements, it might be interesting in the
normative phase to collect all security requirements written by SA3 into a
single \"catalogue\" document. It would then be possible for the individual
SCASs of different network product classes to refer to it directly. This
approach matches the requirement that a SCAS will have to be developed in a
modular fashion such that an individual module is generic enough to be applied
to more than one network product class. This approach can help to prevent from
writing the same security requirements from scratch several times in different
network product class SCAS (see clause 4.1.4 of the present document).
It is important to underline that the SA3 catalogue shall be constructed from
existing SCASs, and the intention is not to first create the catalogue and
then write the first SCAS based on it. No requirements shall be included in
the catalogue before it has been included in a SCAS. This prevents the
catalogue from accumulating \"good-to-have\" requirements that are never used
in real SCASs. Consequently, the way to build the proposed catalogue is an
iterative process that counts the following steps:
1) Start the normative phase for a specific Network Product Class (e.g. MME).
2) Select from the identified sources (for example, CC2, NDPP, OSPP) the
proper security requirements that meet the needs of the security objectives
and adapt them to SECAM.
3) Add this adapted requirements in the SECAM catalogue in order to reuse if
possible during the normative phase of other Network Product Classes.
4) Start the normative phase of another Network Product Class (e.g. eNB) and
refer to the security requirements already available in the SECAM catalogue if
possible otherwise select the new ones from the agreed sources (e.g. CC2,
NDPP, OSPP) and update the Catalogue.
**Usage of CC structure for requirements (class, family, components)**
CC part 2 [15] group security requirements in class, family and components as
shown in the picture below:
{width="5.404166666666667in" height="1.6840277777777777in"}
A class is a collection of security requirements assessing security risks or
defined as a countermeasure to eliminate security vulnerabilities inherent to
a given feature/capability. As an example the class \"Security Management\"
covers the security risks the product administration introduces: sensitive
information that normally is not transmitted across a network, such as product
identifying information, configuration information, and other sensitive
management information such as user names and passwords can be transmitted.
The security requirements the network product shall be compliant to ensure
that management does not expose this sensitive data to someone sniffing or
eavesdropping on the network.
CC part 2 [15] contains the following classes:
\- Security Audit: Security auditing involves recognising, recording, storing,
and analysing information related to security relevant activities.
\- Communication: This class provides two families specifically concerned with
assuring the identity of a party participating in a data exchange (proof or
origin, proof of receipt...).
\- Cryptographic support: Cryptographic functionalities can be required to
satisfy several high-level security objectives. These latter include (but are
not limited to): identification and authentication, non-repudiation, trusted
path, trusted channel and data separation. So this class provides mainly
requirements on cryptographic operation and key management
  * \- User data protection: This class provides requirements related to user data protection. - Identification and authentication: This class addresses address the requirements for functions to establish and verify a claimed user identity. Identification and Authentication are required to ensure that users are associated with the proper security attributes (e.g. identity, groups, roles, security or integrity levels).
\- Security management: This class is intended to specify the management of
several aspects of the TOE Security Functions: security attributes, data and
functions. The different management roles and their interaction, such as
capability, can be specified.
\- Privacy: This class contains privacy requirements. These requirements
provide a user protection against discovery and misuse of identity by other
users.
\- Protection of the TOE Security Functions: This class contains families of
functional requirements related to the integrity of the mechanisms that
constitute the TOE Security Functions and to the integrity of its own specific
data.
\- Resource utilisation: This class provides three families that support the
availability of required resources such as processing capability and/or
storage capacity.
\- Resource Allocation provides limits on the use of available resources,
therefore preventing users from monopolising the resources.
\- TOE access: This class provides the functional requirements for controlling
the establishment of a user\'s session
\- Trusted path: This class defines the requirements to establish and maintain
trusted communication to or from users and the TOE Security Functions.
During SCAS writing SA3 may use these classes and grouping as guidance in
order to ensure that no area of the network product class was missed.
As detailed in 4.1.4, SCAS will have to be developed in a modular fashion such
that an individual module is generic enough to be applied to more than one
network product class. The final choice of classes for this requirement
catalogue is a normative phase activity. Whether SA3 choice will map the CC
categories or not will depend on the number of requirements per classes and
can only be decided when most of these requirements are already written.
Security requirements are expected to follow a template similar to the one
described hereafter:
**Template for a Security Requirement Description**
Editor\'s note It is ffs whether it would useful to introduce in an SCAS the
concept of conditional requirements. If a function that is optional for a
given network product class is present, then security requirements, made
conditional on the presence of this function, will apply, otherwise not.
Statements of security requirements are intended to be clear, concise and
unambiguous. A template for this purpose may follow the structure reported in
this clause. In particular, each security requirement shall include:
_\- Requirement name_ : each security requirement is assigned a unique name.
The name indicates the topics covered by the requirement
_\- Requirement reference:_ a unique short form of the security requirement is
provided as a primary means for referencing the class. The convention adopted
is _: \  \- \_ or similar convention
_\- Requirement Description:_ a detailed description for the security
requirements identified by SA3 to reduce/counteract the risks outlined by the
threat analysis.
_\- Threat reference:_ the short identifier assigned to the threat, here used
to mapping the requirement to the threat it intend to meet
_\- Test case:_ a description of the test case that defines how the
requirement shall be tested, the expected skills and tools to be used to
produce the test outputs _._
_\- Requirement evidences:_ the type of evidence that must be achieved, that
is the expected test results
NOTE 1: The level of abstraction that should be chosen for test cases should
allow implementation specific solution as long as they comply with the SCAS
intention. This level of details is likely to be variable depending on the
test. This work is to be done during the normative phase.
NOTE 2: Tests can consist of different types of activities. It could for
example consist in reviewing documentation provided by the vendor for a given
security requirement but also be of a more technical nature that will imply
interaction and stimulation of the network product with a protocol testing
tool for example. The concrete test activities will be defined in the
normative phase.
**[Example of derivation of a security requirement from a CC part 2
requirement:]{.underline}**
Even if the generic functional requirements are taken from CC Part 2, they
have to be instantiated and refined, at least to the extent that they are
meaningful to fulfil and still remain applicable to all network products of
the network product class.
Dependent requirements are not required to be included and can be skipped if a
short rationale is provided for why it is acceptable to do so. It will be
determined in the normative phase in which document rationales will be
captured.
An example of audit generation FAU_GEN.1.1 taken from the OSPP v3.9 and NDPP
v1.1:
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | This is the requirement as | FAU_GEN.1.1 | | specified in CC3.1R4 Part 2 | | | | The TSF shall be able to | | | generate an audit record of the | | | following auditable events: | | | | | | a) Start-up and shutdown of the | | | audit functions; | | | | | | `{=html} | | |  | | |` | | | a) All auditable events for the | | | [selection, choose one of: | | | _minimum, basic, detailed, | | | not specified_] level of | | | audit; and | | | | | | b) [assignment: _other | | | specifically defined | | | auditable events_]. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | This is how it is instantiated | FAU_GEN.1.1 | | in OSPP v3.9 | | | | The TSF shall be able to | | | generate an audit record of the | | | following auditable events: | | | | | | a) Start-up and shutdown of the | | | audit functions; | | | | | | `{=html} | | |  | | |` | | | a) All auditable events for the | | | **not specified** level of | | | audit; and | | | | | | b) **all modifications to the | | | set of events being | | | audited;** | | | | | | c) **all user authentication | | | attempts;** | | | | | | d) **all denied accesses to | | | objects for which the access | | | control policy defined in | | | the OSPP base applies;** | | | | | | e) **explicit modifications of | | | access rights to objects | | | covered by the access | | | control policies; and** | | | | | | f) **other specifically defined | | | auditable events as defined | | | in the table in | | | FAU_GEN.1.2.** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | This is how it is instantiated | FAU_GEN.1.1 | | in NDPP v1.1. | | | | The TSF shall be able to | | Note that the dependent | generate an audit record of the | | requirement FPT_STM.1 is | following auditable events: | | include and that the additional | | | requirement FIA_UIA_EXT.1 | a) Start-up of the audit | | shows additional events that | functions; | | shall be logged. | | | | b) All auditable events for the | | | **not specified** level of | | | audit; and | | | | | | c) **All administrative | | | actions;** | | | | | | d) **Specifically defined | | | auditable events listed in | | | Table 1**. | | | | | | **Table 1 -- Auditable events | | | and audit record content:** | | | | | | **FIA_UIA_EXT.1 All use of the | | | identification and | | | authentication mechanism. | | | (Provided user identity, origin | | | of the attempt, e.g., IP | | | address).** | | | | | | **FPT_STM.1 Changes to the | | | time. (The old and new values | | | for the time. Origin of the | | | attempt, e.g., IP address).** | | | | | | [...] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
The SCAS may add explicit tests to these requirements. For example, the test
whether \"Start-up and shutdown of the audit functions;\" is performed by the
network product, the product can be started and then stopped and the log can
be examined if these events get properly logged.
Here is a concrete example of an instantiation of FAU_GEN.1.1 in the Template
for a Security Requirement Description:
  * _Requirement name:_ Security audit data generation
\- _Requirement reference:_ FAU_GEN.1.1 (or something else if it becomes
necessary to use a different nomenclature to point out that there may be
differences compared to CC).
\- _Requirement Description:_ The TSF shall be able to generate an audit
record of the following auditable events:
> \- Start-up of the audit functions;
>
> \- All auditable events for the not specified level of audit; and
>
> \- All administrative actions;
>
> \- Specifically defined auditable events listed in Table 1.
>
> \- Table 1 -- Auditable events and audit record content:
>
> \- FIA_UIA_EXT.1 All use of the identification and authentication mechanism.
> (Provided user identity, origin of the attempt, e.g., IP address).
>
> \- FPT_STM.1 Changes to the time. (The old and new values for the time.
> Origin of the attempt, e.g., IP address).
>
> \- [...]
_\- Threat reference:_ T1, T2, T3
_\- Test case:_ Start node and examine if log contains start up event. Login
as administrator and examine if log contains the login attempt. Expected tools
include log-reader. The skills required by the tester are ability to generate
the events and using the log-reader. ...
_\- Requirement evidences:_ A document in free form describing which events
were generated, the output from the log-reader.
**[Example of an \"hardening type\" security requirement:]{.underline}**
Hardening requirements can also help to make the software/hardware of a
network product more robust against un-authorized remote or physical access
and can be tested as shown in the following example.
_\- Requirement name_**:** Unauthenticated services binding
\- _Requirement reference:_ HARDENING_BINDING.1.1
_\- Requirement Description:_ No unauthenticated services shall be bound to
physically accessible ports of the network product. Unauthenticated service
running on the network product and bound to physically accessible ports, even
if not security related, can be used by an attacker to gain connectivity on
the network product. The attacker could then try to escalate their privileges
to further compromise the network product. No unauthenticated service shall be
bound to physically accessible ports.
_\- Threat reference:_ T1, T2, T3;
_\- Test case:_
\- Review the documentation provided by the vendor describing the physically
accessible ports and the services bound to them
\- Document in the report the services listening on each physically accessible
port and the type of credential required for access.
\- Connect to all documented services and check that authentication is
required.
\- Connect on each physically accessible port and run an appropriate scan to
detect listening services on all relevant OSI layers and check whether non
documented services are listening and accessible.
\- or where remote scanning results are not meaningful like e.g. in case of
UDP, use appropriate in-host tools to verify that only documented services are
listening and accessible on the physically accessible port
_\- Requirements evidences:_ A document in free form describing: the services
listening on each physically accessible port and the type of credential
required for access and the output from the different scanning tools.
Applicability of a hardening requirement may depend on the OS or application
running on the network product. E.g. in case the hardening requires removal of
all non-public-key based authentication:
\- Vendor A has implemented this by running the COTS component OpenSSH.
Hardening for this authentication function includes e.g. disabling password
based login.
\- Vendor B implements this by a proprietary protocol with public and private
keys, i.e. a non-COTS component. Hardening for this authentication function
includes e.g. ensuring that password based authentication is not implemented
or disabled
What ultimately matters for the SECAM evaluation (compliance and
vulnerability) is that the network products fulfil the security requirement
(functional and hardening) and pass the related test cases, not what method
was applied by the vendor to do so.
NOTE 3: To fulfil the test cases, implementation and documentation of
functional requirements may also include implementation and documentation of
some of the hardening requirements
#### 5.2.2.5 Security Assurance Specification instantiation documents creation
The SCAS instantiation consist of a set of documents provided by the Vendor to
give evaluators and operators the relevant information to understand **the
critical parts of the network product to be evaluated.** The SCAS
instantiation provides a concrete mapping of the \"theoretical\" assets and
security requirements of the SCAS into \"real\" assets and components
supporting the security requirements of the network product being evaluated.
The SCAS instantiation is a set of documents and is not expected to have a
fixed structure. This will allow Vendors to maximise the reuse of existing
documentation.
The content of the SCAS instantiation is however defined and it shall contain
details on:
\- Network Product description (e.g. software version, documentation version)
\- Scope of evaluation
\- Mapping of SCAS security requirements to the network product and assets in
the network product
\- References to the applicable document versions containing Operational
guidance in the documentation of the network product
\- Information needed to start the Security Compliance Testing, Basic
Vulnerability Testing and Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis
This document set is updated by the Vendors until the testers (Security
Compliance Testing, Basic Vulnerability Testing and Enhanced Vulnerability
Analysis) consider they have enough and correct information to execute the
required tests. Details on the content of these documents and of the update
process are provided in clause 5.2.4.2.
#### 5.2.2.6 Accreditation and monitoring rules creation
SECAM Accreditation Body shall describe the rules for accreditation and
monitoring of development and test laboratories, whether they are vendors or
third-party laboratories. A formalised dispute resolution process for
accreditation and monitoring is likely to be required as the denial or delay
of accreditation may have far-reaching consequences.
### 5.2.3 Vendors and third-party laboratories accreditation
#### 5.2.3.1 Overview
NOTE: The final choices and rules for the accreditation and monitoring rules
are under the responsibility of the SECAM Accreditation Body. This clause
still describes this process for the sake of completeness by giving examples
of possible rules.
In order to be allowed to conduct the evaluation, the vendors or third-party
laboratories must demonstrate they have the skills, working practices and
resources to participate in the process.
This can be achieved e.g. by a combination:
\- an evaluation of general methodology skills (through an ISO 17025
accreditation -- applicable to vendors test laboratories or third-party test
laboratories only) (see 5.2.3.1)
\- an \"audit and accreditation\" by the SECAM Accreditation Body to
demonstrate that the Evaluators have the necessary skills. It would be up to
the SECAM Accreditation Body to indicate how the evaluator can demonstrate
their competency in conducting an evaluation for conformance to 3GPP SCAS
requirements. (see 5.2.3.4)
All vendors (with or without a testing laboratory) will be subject to:
\- a quality qualification (see 5.2.3.2)
\- an audit and accreditation of network product development and network
product lifecycle management process (see 5.2.3.3)
The quality and reliability of these demonstrations are of paramount
importance to the integrity of the scheme.
Figure 4 hereafter shows the main phases of an accreditation processes.

Figure 5.2.3-1: Accreditation of vendors or third-party laboratories by SECAM
Accreditation Body
Accreditation is valid for a limited time period. When it is expired,
accredited actor (vendors or third-party laboratories) may renew the
accreditation for extension. It will help the SECAM Accreditation Body to
manage accredited actor and to ensure the accreditation has the lifecycle.
In order to manage the accreditation and ensure the validity period of
accreditation, there may be some activities for this process:
\- accreditation register: the vendors or third-party laboratories may
register for the accreditation;
\- accreditation renewal: when the accreditation is expire or the vendor or
third-party laboratories has an important update, it may renew the
accreditation;
\- accreditation revocation: the accreditation expires, fraud or other
improper means to pass the accreditation.
#### 5.2.3.2 Methodology and quality accreditation
SECAM resorts to already established and widely recognized accreditation
bodies to assess the methodological practice of testing laboratories, whether
they perform Security Compliance Testing, Basic Vulnerability Testing or
Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis. It also relies on these bodies for the
Quality Qualification for Vendors. These generic methodological practices
(quality system of the testing laboratories, ability to calibrate tools...)
and quality qualification for vendors are not SECAM specific and thus for
these tasks, the SECAM Accreditation Body will rely on already well-recognised
national accreditation bodies in this area.
Ideally, accreditation bodies involved in SECAM-related accreditation are
directly worldwide operating and recognized organizations or national bodies
participating in an internationally recognized umbrella organization covered
by a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).
E.g. the ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation,
https://www.ilac.org/) full members are signers of the ILAC MRA which amongst
others includes the mutual recognition of ISO 17025 (General requirements for
the competence of testing and calibration laboratories) accreditations.
Example of national accreditation bodies being signers of the ILAC MRA are:
\- ANSI-ASQ / ANAB in the USA;
\- CNAS in the People\'s Republic of China;- ACCREDIA in Italy;
\- COFRAC in France;
\- DAkkS in Germany;
\- UKAS in the United Kingdom;
\- JAB in Japan;
\- KOLAS in the Republic of Korea;
\- etc. (about 80 ILAC MRA signers in total)
For SECAM specific aspects (clause 5.2.3.3 and clause 5.2.3.4), the
responsible body for accreditation is the SECAM Accreditation Body.
**[Quality qualification for Vendors]{.underline}**
To ensure that the manufacturer\'s design, development and manufacturing
processes are, and remain, compliant with a recognised quality assurance
standard, the manufacturer\'s quality system must be under regular review as
part of an accredited activity via for example an ISO 9000 or an appropriate
regional equivalent accreditation.
**[Methodology Accreditation for vendors or third-party testing
laboratories]{.underline}**
To ensure that the methodological practice of vendors or third-party testing
laboratories are, and remain, compliant with a recognised standard, the
vendors or third-party testing laboratories must be under regular review as
part of an accredited activity via for example an ISO 17025 or an appropriate
regional equivalent accreditation.
#### 5.2.3.3 Audit and accreditation of Vendor network product development and
network product lifecycle management process
The evaluation of the security relevant part of the Vendor network product
development and network product lifecycle management process is done as part
of the vendor accreditation process by the SECAM Accreditation Body.\ The
network product development process and network product lifecycle management
process document detailing the accreditation requirements and test cases is
the one described in clause 5.2.2.3.
The Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle
management process assessment covers a Vendor\'s engineering processes and
does not necessarily apply only to a single network product. That means that
the results of one assessment may apply to more than one network product. The
Accreditor mandated by the SECAM Accreditation Body should note in the
accreditation where there is evidence to suggest that the scope of the
validation is unlikely to apply to more than one network product.
Vendors can get their generic network product development and network product
lifecycle management process or a subset of it accredited. A generic network
product development and network product lifecycle management process is
usually used during development of all or some products of the same Vendor. As
different network product development and network product lifecycle management
processes could be utilized within the organization of one Vendor, e.g. due to
mergers or acquisitions, Vendors could obtain and hold accreditation for
different generic network product development and network product lifecycle
management processes.
Once the vendor gets accredited and as long as the accreditation has not
expired, vendors are allowed to produce development process compliance
declarations for the \"network product development and network product
lifecycle management process compliance validation\" task (cf. 5.2.4.1) on
their own.
At the beginning of a SECAM evaluation of a product, the Vendor will have to
provide a development process compliance declaration to the compliance tester
containing a rationale showing that the generic accredited process was
effectively applied in the network product development and network product
lifecycle management of the network product under evaluation (see 5.2.4.2 for
details).
NOTE 1: The requirements on the process and acceptable evidences (\"test
cases\") as well as the definition of way to get an accreditation for these
requirements is under the responsibility of the SECAM Accreditation Body which
will have to deal with the cost/complexity/assurance trade-off.\ It should be
avoided that vendors need to obtain a large number of accreditations for their
network product development and network product lifecycle management process.
NOTE 2: The Vendor is expected employ Industry related good working practices,
aligned to the relevant parts of the ISO/IEC 27000 series. Although these
areas will not be formally audited by the Accreditor mandated by the SECAM
Accreditation Body, it is unlikely a Vendor would be able to provide
satisfactory evidence for meeting the SECAM requirements without having such
policies and working practices in place. Moreover, the test cases for the
SECAM requirements are expected to leave room to the vendor to reuse evidences
from these previous accreditations and thus reduce costs.
#### 5.2.3.4 Audit and accreditation of testing laboratories
The accreditation is performed by the SECAM Accreditation Body, and consists
in:
\- assessing the skills of the vendors or third-party laboratories in
conducting an evaluation for conformance to 3GPP SCAS requirements for a given
network product class or range of classes;
\- assessing the compliance to Test methodology (for security compliance
Testing, Basic Vulnerability Testing and Enhanced vulnerability Analysis
laboratories).
One can be accredited for Security Compliance Testing, Basic Vulnerability
Testing or Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis or for all four of them. The audit
for the accreditation is typically performed during an evaluation session
where the testing laboratory demonstrates its skills to an auditor from the
SECAM Accreditation Body by undertaking the tests on a concrete network
product.
NOTE: An accreditation might only be applicable to a given LTE network product
class, since it assesses the technical skills of the testing laboratories. The
requirements on the network product classes and acceptable evidences (\"test
cases\") will be defined by SA3. However the definition of way to get an
accreditation for testing these requirements and the definition of the
coverage of the accreditation (for one or for several network product classes,
and/or for testing) is under the responsibility of the SECAM Accreditation
Body which will have to deal with the cost/complexity/assurance trade-off. It
should be avoided that laboratories, vendor or a third party need to obtain a
large number of accreditations
#### 5.2.3.5 Criteria on accreditation of security compliance testing
laboratories
NOTE: It is FFS at the time the accreditation criteria are actually defined
what suitable means to assess individual skills are. All suggestions for such
assessments stated here are ideas how that could be done. In general, when it
is not guaranteed that assessments are done in a manner that are efficient in
serving their purpose and are deterministic in their outcome they don\'t need
to be executed in the first place. Therefore it needs to be studied in detail
how efficient they are and it must be ensured that they are reproducible
before they are used.
The accreditation is expected to determine that the security compliance
testing laboratories have:
\- Sufficient auditing skills to assess that the Vendor provided enough
evidences that the network product is following the \"Vendor development and
lifecycle management\" accredited process
\- Accurately describe their test procedures, results and conclusions
\- such skills might be assessable through a case study or a \"pilot\"
evaluation performed under the supervision of the accreditor.
\- Capacity to assess the consistency between a SCAS and an instantiated SCAS
\- Capacity to assess the coverage of the SCAS / instantiated SCAS by tests
\- Such skills might be assessable by an examination showing the knowledge of
the SCAS, and a case study to assess the rigour when determining the coverage
of SCAS by a given instantiated SCAS
\- Define a representative testbed for a given network product:
\- Perform representative and complete tests derived from the SCAS:
\- Such skills might be assessable by an oral examination showing the general
knowledge of the considered network product, in particular
\- Protocols and interfaces
\- Administration and deployment issues
\- The skills necessary to perform the Security Compliance Testing required by
the SCAS will depend on the nature of the SCAS tests defined in the normative
phase (e.g. \"black-box\" testing, code auditing, documentation review ...)
\- Such skills might be assessable by a case study examination conducted by
the accreditor
\- Accreditation could consequently be performed separately for different
network products, and a tester could be accredited only for some products
\- a \"pilot\" evaluation performed under the supervision of the accreditor
could also be considered as a mean to assess those skills as a whole.
#### 5.2.3.6 Criteria on accreditation of Basic Vulnerability testing
laboratories
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the skill set for this activity is different
from the one from the compliance testers\' laboratories or whether it is
similar. Whether this separate activity could be run by the compliance
testers\' laboratories to keep the methodology simple and limit the number of
actors and accreditation is also FFS.
#### 5.2.3.6 Criteria on accreditation of Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis
(EVA) testing laboratories
The Accreditation Body shall administer the assessment of relevant criteria,
standardized in the normative phase, to determine that the EVA testers have
sufficient skills and administer the assessment. The following are possible
assessment scopes and techniques:
\- Accurately describe their test procedures, results and conclusions.
\- such skills could be assessed through a case study or a \"pilot\"
evaluation performed under the supervision of the accreditor.
\- Capacity to assess the security consistency between the SCAS and an
instantiated SCAS, especially the capacity to assess whether the attacker
model stays consistent within the environment described in the instantiated
SCAS:
\- Capacity to determine if certain attacks are within the scope of the
attacker model:
\- Sufficient skills to perform an impact analysis of a vendor update of the
network product;
\- Skills also include general penetration testing methodology capacities;
such skills could be assessed by a case study examination conducted by the
accreditor
\- Capacity to assess the consistency of TOE/TSF in a given network product,
especially capacity to assess that environmental assumptions are not used to
waive security functionalities required by the SCAS:
\- define and perform representative and complete tests:
\- Such skills could be assessed by an oral examination showing the general
knowledge of penetration testing in the considered network product
\- Accreditation could consequently be perform separately for different
network products, and an tester could be accredited only for some products
(e.g. only for core network products)
\- a \"pilot\" evaluation performed under the supervision of the accreditor
could also be considered as a mean to assess those skills as a whole.
### 5.2.4 Evaluation and evaluation report
#### 5.2.4.1 Network product development process and network product lifecycle
management
The security relevant part of the Vendor network product development and
network product lifecycle management process is evaluated during an initial
accreditation administrated by the SECAM Accreditation Body according to
5.2.3.3 prior to any network product evaluation. During a network product
evaluation, the compliance testing laboratories validate that effectively the
accredited process was used for the network product under consideration. To
allow this evaluation, the vendor shall provide the following documents to the
compliance testing laboratories _and, if requested, to the operator:_
\- The Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle
management process accreditation certificate from the SECAM Accreditation Body
\- The Vendor Network Product Development and network product lifecycle
management process self-evaluation report for the network product under
evaluation containing:
\- a rationale showing that the generic accredited security relevant part of
the process was effectively applied during the development of the network
product under evaluation [free-form]
The compliance testing laboratories will review this self-evaluation report
and evaluate if the rationale provided by the Vendor provides enough evidences
that the network product is following the accredited process.
If the report is acceptable, the evaluation continues. If not, the testing
laboratories request the vendor to get accredited for the process of this
network product as well. In most cases, compliance testing will be undertaken
by the vendors themselves and conflict are expected to be rare. However, the
compliance testing laboratories take a responsibility in this assessment as
the rationale and the description of the generic accredited process will also
be given to the operators which are likely to review them as well. Conflict
between vendors, testing laboratories and operators will be resolved by the
SECAM Accreditation Body.
NOTE: Required and acceptable evidence for the vendor Network Product
Development and network product lifecycle management process self-evaluation
report need to be defined by the SECAM Accreditation Body to ensure
comparability and easy conflict resolution if any.
#### 5.2.4.2 SCAS instantiation evaluation
##### 5.2.4.2.1 Overview
SCAS instantiation evaluation is to check whether an SCAS instantiation
written by a vendor is a correct instantiation of the SCAS of the network
product class and whether it is a good basis for evaluating the network
product.
The accredited evaluator (vendor or third-party evaluator) for security
compliance testing is responsible for SCAS instantiation evaluation before it
is used to evaluate network product. The evaluator shall confirm at least that
the SCAS being instantiated for a given 3GPP network product and the network
product for evaluation are consistent,
##### 5.2.4.2.2 Content
##### 5.2.4.2.2.1 Scope of evaluation {#scope-of-evaluation .H6}
##### 5.2.4.2.2.1.1 Overview {#overview-6 .H6}
A given network product from a vendor might be packaged in different ways for
each commercial transaction to address the tailored request from operators.
For example, vendor A might package and commercialized its MME network product
Z1 as an application only with the operator being responsible to provide the
hardware and the virtualisation environment to run this MME network product.
In some individual cases, some operators might however request that the vendor
provides a complete bundle (including hardware and virtualisation solution) in
addition to the MME application Z1.
SECAM evaluations are conducted for a particular packaging of the network
product. One objective in SECAM is to ensure maximum reusability of evaluation
results of the evaluation of a particular package while still provide a clear
and comprehensive description of the boundaries of what was evaluated. In
practice to maximize the reuse, the vendor is likely to have the most commonly
sold package of its network product evaluated.
A clear definition of the boundaries of what was evaluated ensures this
reusability but also prevent a false perception of what was security tested as
additional components are facing well-defined interfaces. These definitions
are provided in the scope of evaluation description provided by the vendor in
the SCAS instantiation by a definition of the TOE and TSF as developed in
5.2.4.2.2.1.2 and 5.2.4.2.2.1.3
CC uses different terms to define what is to be evaluated, namely Target of
Evaluation (TOE) and TOE Security Functionality (TSF).Given the differences
between Common Criteria and Methodology 2 approaches, those terms are not
necessarily identical to their CC counterparts. Clarifications on the
differences are provided in the dedicated clauses.
NOTE: SECAM provides no provision to assess whether the evaluation results for
a different package of the network product that the one that was evaluated are
still valid. However as the boundaries of what was evaluated are made clear by
the scope of evaluation clause in the SCAS instantiation, the operator can
make their security acceptance decision with a clear understanding of what was
evaluated for this new package.
##### 5.2.4.2.2.1.2 TOE {#toe .H6}
The TOE defines what, within the commercialized Network Product, is to be
evaluated. It is defined Common Criteria as \"a set of software, firmware
and/or hardware possibly accompanied by guidance.\" In CC, the TOE is defined
by the vendor. In CC evaluations not following a Protection Profile there is a
huge latitude for the vendors in this definition, since a vendor may choose to
include components in, or exclude them from, the TSF at free will. This
latitude does not exist for SECAM since the TSF for the entire network product
as commercialized by the vendor is defined by the available and applicable
SCASs.
The TOE description does not contain security requirements or functions, but a
logical and physical perimeter for the evaluation. Since this perimeter
heavily depends on the vendor's particular version of the Network Product, the
TOE is not described in the SCAS, and must be described by the vendor in the
instantiated SCAS. The term TOE may however be used in the SCAS text (e.g. a
security requirement in an SCAS may define that "the integrity of the TOE
shall be protected during delivery"). The term TOE if used in an SCAS always
refers to the TOE described in the SCAS instantiation.
In order to ensure that the TOE is sufficiently comprehensive and well
described, the definition of the TOE shall describe its content in terms of
high level components and external interfaces. This content shall comply with
the following requirements:
\- All elements mandated by relevant SCAS requirements for the network product
class(es) shall be included in the TOE.\ All interfaces of the TSF shall be
part of the description of the TOE. This defines a condition for a minimum
size of the TOE.
Editor\'s note: If SA3 decides to introduce in an SCAS the concept of
conditional requirements (see clause 5.2) the formulation in the above bullet
will have to be adapted to 'all APPLICABLE requirements\' or similar
\- All external communication interfaces of the TOE shall be part of the TOE
description. External communication interfaces of the TOE are interfaces that
allow communications between functions inside and outside the TOE.\ If the TOE
is not the entire product as packaged for evaluation then the interfaces
between the TOE and the parts of the network product not in the TOE need to be
described as external communication interfaces of the TOE. Justification why
it is not possible to access the assets of the network product as defined per
the SCAS by other means that the external interfaces of the TOE must be
provided.
NOTE 1: The Basic Vulnerability Testing will be conducted on the external
communication interfaces of the TOE. If the TOE definition is smaller than the
entire network product, the above requirement makes possible to have external
communication interfaces of TOE under evaluation that are not in the set of
external communication interfaces of the network product. Testing these
external interfaces of the TOE which might be potentially internal interfaces
of the network product might be challenging. Moreover, proving that the above
mentioned justification is valid might be challenging. Thus reducing the scope
of the TOE to a smaller subset than the network product does not guarantee
easier testing.
NOTE 2: this requirement is to ensure that these interfaces are covered by the
BVT and EVA. It also ensures that no external interface to the product not
covered by the TOE can be used to attack the TOE as such attacks would have to
go through an external communication interface of the TOE.
\- A TOE is allowed to be larger than this minimum size defined by the
preceding bullets. NOTE1 above explains why this may be useful.
##### 5.2.4.2.2.1.3 TSF {#tsf .H6}
CC also defines TSF as the \"combined functionality of all hardware, software,
and firmware of a TOE that must be relied upon for the correct enforcement of
the Security Functional Requirements\". In CC, the vendor has latitude
regarding the definition of TSF interfaces in terms of _granularity_ (entire
process supporting the security function, API within this process, physical
interface of the board embedding the process...).
In SECAM, the context is different, because the tests are already described,
although at a high level, within the SCAS. Through the sum of requirements in
the SCAS a set of Generic Security Functionality (GSF), from which the TSF for
the instantiated SCAS is to be derived is implicitly defined.
NOTE 1: To have consistent derivation of the GSF into a TSF by the vendors,
the GSF for a given network product class will be included in the
corresponding SCAS. The definition of this GSF for a given network product
class is expected to take place at the end of the SCAS writing process (i.e
after the verification of the security requirements, see 5.2.2.4.1 "Writing
process overview"). The exact format of this GSF (table, list) is left for the
normative phase.
In SECAM, the TSF would be a \"combined functionality of all hardware,
software, and firmware of a TOE that must be relied upon for the correct
enforcement of the SCAS requirements\". Whether a component is part or not of
the TSF as well as the granularity of the definition of a component is
disambiguated by the test cases of the SCAS. For example an SCAS may include
the following requirement:
_Requirement: The product shall include a security audit function, accessible
only by a user having the role admin X, logged through SSH on the server._
_Test case:_
_\- the tester shall connect as the admin user through SSH and verify that he
can access the audit_
_\- the tester shall verify that a user without admin rights cannot access the
audit using the same connection_
_\- the tester shall verify that no other means exist to access the audit
except a SSH session_
In this case it is clear what, from where to test and how to test (physical
port of the network product where the SH server is listening).
##### 5.2.4.2.2.1.4 GSF/TSF adaptation for special circumstances {#gsftsf-
adaptation-for-special-circumstances .H6}
Editor\'s note: This section shall describe how to deal with cases where a
Network Product needs to adapt the GSF described in an SCAS to its own
circumstances. This could e.g. happen when the Network Product only partially
implements a so far foreseen Network Product Class. In such cases where, where
there is no fully fitting existing SCAS for a SECAM evaluation but only close
matches the derivation of the TSF in the instantiated SCAS from the GSF in the
SCAS might need some special adaptation.
Editor\'s note: Also this section will describe the solution for cases, where
the existing SCAS by mistake has flaws which are discovered during, but cannot
be resolved in time by 3GPP for, an on going SECAM evaluation. The possibility
for GSF/TSF adaptation shall also avoid that SCAS creation and Network Product
Class scoping gets too complex and spawns a multitude of parallel versions
with very small distinguishing differences.
##### 5.2.4.2.2.1.5 Exclusion of components {#exclusion-of-components .H6}
The SCAS instantiation shall not exclude a component from testing on the
grounds that it was already evaluated under another scheme unless this SCAS
allows it explicitly to refer to the certificate obtained under this different
scheme for a given set of tests (e.g. FIPS).
Editor\'s note: Whether SECAM recognizes the results of other evaluation (for
example FIPS) and requires re-testing is FFS
No component can be removed from the TOE or from the TSF on the grounds that
it was not developed by vendor itself and that it is an outsourced or the
3^rd^ party component.
##### 5.2.4.2.2.2 Mapping of SCAS security requirements to the network product
and assets in the network product {#mapping-of-scas-security-requirements-to-
the-network-product-and-assets-in-the-network-product .H6}
The goal of the mapping is to enforce consistency between
  * The TOE as defined by the vendor
  * The GSF as defined by the SCAS and the potentially refined TSF in the instantiated SCAS by the vendor
It mainly consists in explaining how the TSF is achieved in the context of the
vendor-specific TOE.
The SCAS instantiation will provide:
\- A concrete mapping of the SCAS \"theoretical\" assets on \"real\" assets on
the network product
\- A concrete mapping of the SCAS security requirements on the high-level
components supporting these functions
The evaluator shall confirm at least that:
\- all assets from SCAS are present in the SCAS instantiation,
NOTE 1: e.g. the SCAS instantiation shall not decide, against the SCAS, that
some assets need no protection because of physical deployment site protection
\- if SCAS instantiation introduces new assets they are considered assets to
be protected in a manner consistent with SCAS
NOTE 2: e.g. if the SCAS instantiation uses two admin roles instead of a
single one in the generic SCAS, both shall have their credentials protected
consistently
\- the SCAS instantiation does not waive threats identified in the SCAS,
NOTE 3: e.g. the SCAS instantiation shall not claim that a threat from the
SCAS is not applicable under the assumption that more organizational control
is performed during administrators\' recruitment
##### 5.2.4.2.2.3 Operational guidance documents and configuration of the
network product for evaluation {#operational-guidance-documents-and-
configuration-of-the-network-product-for-evaluation .H6}
Operational guidance documents are part of the documentation created by the
vendor and are part of the SCAS instantiation documentation (see 5.2.4.2 for
details on SCAS instantiation evaluation). This documentation contains the
information on how to initialize, configure and operate the network product so
that SECAM security requirements are met. The network product and the content
of the \"operational guidance documents\" must be fully aligned.
E.g. this documentation could be a user manual indicating to the
administrator:
\- By default, the network product is provisioned with root password \"XXXX\"
\- The network product will NOT be able to operate as long as this password in
not changed using procedure Y
\- The minimum password length is 12 characters for secure operation, at least
12 characters password MUST be chosen
These documents will be used by:
\- vendor or operator staff during initial setup of the network product
\- vendor or operator staff during operation of the network product
\- vendor or operator staff during maintenance or upgrade of the network
product
\- evaluators during SECAM compliance and vulnerability evaluations to install
a representative test bed.
SECAM tested configuration should reflect the setting that an administrator
would choose based on these documents. To install a representative test bed,
the evaluators will follow this documentation. During evaluation of a network
product, no security-related initialization, configuration or operation
activities other than those contained in the \"operational guidance
documents\" will be followed; those in the documents must be followed in full.
NOTE 1: As part of SCAS instantiation documents the evaluators will evaluate
these \"Operational Guidance documents\" and verify that these documents do
not make unrealistic assumptions on the environment that waive a security
requirement or a threat from SECAM and would make the test bed not
representative.
NOTE 2: In the scope of SCEAM it is implicitly mandatory for the vendor to
consider the security requirements defined in SECAM for creating the
operational guidance documents. If relevant initialization, configuration and
operation instructions were missing from the operational guidance documents
then the network product will inevitably fail the test cases for the
respective security requirements.
##### 5.2.4.2.2.4 Information needed to execute the required tests for SCT,
BVT and EVA activities {#information-needed-to-execute-the-required-tests-for-
sct-bvt-and-eva-activities .H6}
**Information needed to execute the required tests for the Security Compliance
Testing:**
The compliance tester assesses whether the SCAS instantiation contains enough
information to:
\- install a representative testbed;
Editor\'s note: The definition of \"representative\" is FFS.
\- define test vectors;
\- execute the test cases;
\- determine whether the tests completely and accurately cover the SCAS.
Editor\'s note: The relation between the \"Test Methodology and skill
requirements \"document and the bullet above has to be clarified.
In cases where the SCAS instantiation does not include enough information, the
compliance tester can ask the vendor to modify/complete the SCAS
instantiation.
**Information needed to execute the required tests for the Basic Vulnerability
Testing:**
The basic vulnerability tester assesses whether the SCAS instantiation
contains enough information to:
\- determine the tools to be used in the Basic Vulnerability Testing;
\- execute the test cases;
\- determine whether all open ports are explicitly documented;
\- determine whether protocol implementations are robust;
\- determine whether the scope of vulnerability scanning reflects the SCAS
requirements;
In cases where the SCAS instantiation does not include enough information, the
BVT tester could ask the vendor to modify/complete the SCAS instantiation.
**Information needed to execute the required tests Enhanced Vulnerability
Analysis:**
The EVA tester could be required to assess whether the SCAS instantiation
contains enough information to:
\- define relevant attack paths;
\- perform penetration tests following these attack paths;
\- determine whether a found possible Vulnerability is exploitable in
practice, within the operational environment of the product;
\- determine whether their tests cover what would be expected from the type of
attackers defined in the SCAS attacker model;
\- eventually conclude whether the network product resists the type of attacks
that are expected from the attacker model defined in the SCAS.
In cases where the SCAS instantiation does not include enough information, the
EVA tester could ask the vendor to modify/complete the SCAS instantiation.
##### 5.2.4.2.3 Process
The usage and update of this set of document during a SECAM evaluation is
described in Figure 5.2.4.2.3 below.

Figure 5.2.4.2.3-1: Overview of the SCAS instantiation documents evolution\
during a SECAM evaluation
Step1 is the initial production by the vendor of the required documentation
and its update if required by step 2. It is outside of the scope of SECAM to
describe this task.
Step 2 is the SCAS instantiation evaluation to check whether an SCAS
instantiation written by a vendor is a correct instantiation of the SCAS of
the network product class and whether it is a good basis for evaluating the
network product.
All accredited testers (SCT, BVT and EVA) are required to assess the SCAS
instantiation before it is used to evaluate network product. This assessment
has two main goals
\- Assessing that the vendor documentation and processes are complete
sufficiently defined to begin the evaluation
\- Validating the elements (scope of evaluation, instantiated assets...) which
must not be modified during the evaluation
For example, should the scope of evaluation be modified between SCT, BVT and
EVA testing, the whole compliance evidences would be obsolete (since the
interfaces, in particular, may have changed). For this reason, all testers are
expected to synchronize from the beginning of evaluation in order to agree on
a scope.
NOTE: During the normative phase, it shall be decided which information can or
cannot be modified without a new assessment and approval from all, SCT, BVT
and EVA testers. The goal is to have an early validation from SCAS
instantiation from all testers to avoid that compliance tests or basic
vulnerability testing are nullified and must be redone before the Enhanced
Vulnerability Analysis.
Step 3 and 4 are the regular SCT+BVT and EVA testing tasks of Methodology 2
which will use this instantiation documentation as input. The evaluation shall
not start (neither SCT nor BVT nor EVA) as long as steps 1 and 2 are not
completed. It is of outmost importance that all the aspects below are agreed
by both evaluators in step 2 before the evaluation start to ensure consistency
in the results of step 3 and step 4.
Further documentation is produced during step 3 and 4. During step 3 for
example, the Security Compliance tester will describe the concrete test bed
used for testing as well as \"instantiated test cases\" (i.e. the description
of the concrete test case on the network product corresponding to the generic
SCAS test case). At the end of step 4, the SCAS instantiation documentation as
well as the SCT, BVT and EVA documentation is an output document provided to
the operator. These documents are described in 5.2.4.3 and 5.2.4.4.
After step 4, all the output documents of step are given to the operator for
its final review and final security acceptance decision.
#### 5.2.4.3 Security Compliance testing
##### 5.2.4.3.1 Inputs
The test bed configured according to the documentation that was produced in
step 2 of clause 5.2.4.2.2.
##### 5.2.4.3.2 Outputs
In the end of Security Compliance tests, the tester will deliver:
\- A declaration about who carried out the tests;
\- Network products/features tested and reasons for not testing where
applicable
\- in particular, copies of other Security Compliance related third party
certificates and test reports of previous evaluation (internal and/or third
party), if appropriate and available;
NOTE: Whether SECAM recognizes the results of other evaluation schemes, the
Security Compliance tester should avoid re-testing previously evaluated items
will be decided in the normative phase requirement per requirement. For
example, if there is a requirement to implement AES-256 encryption for a
component, SECAM might accept a FIPS evaluation of the cryptographic module as
a valid test result and might not ask the Security Compliance tester to verify
again (source code review, test vectors...) that AES-256 is indeed
implemented.
\- a description of the testbed used for the tests, which shall be
\- accurate,
\- make the test bed reproducible (non ambiguous),
\- representative of real-life network product deployment;
\- the test tools and vectors used for the tests;
\- a rationale which demonstrates that the tests cover the SCAS test cases
\- the test procedure followed in practice [following SCAS test cases] and
results [following SCAS output format indications];
##### 5.2.4.3.3 Activities
The security compliance of a network product is its compliance to a defined
set of security requirements. The security requirements set will be provided
in the security assurance specification following the template of
5.2.2.4.2.3.3.\ Many examples of requirements are available in Annex A.2. The
test case describes the validation technique to be used by the Security
Compliance Testing laboratories as well as the expected outputs to provide in
the evaluation report.\ It is worth noting that, at least a test case is
defined for every security requirement, since every security requirement
should lead to
_\- positive_ tests (the network product performs as expected when operated
correctly with correct inputs)
\- _negative_ tests (the network product correctly handles error cases such as
incorrect usage or incorrect inputs)
3GPP SCAS specifications provide guidelines for the type of tools to be used
for the validation of these tests.\ This test case describes the validation
technique to be used by the security compliance testing laboratories as well
as the expected outputs to provide in the evaluation report.
Security compliance testing laboratories execute the tests contained in the
3GPP SCAS for the evaluated network product as described in the test cases,
collect evaluation evidences and include them in the final security compliance
report (see clause 5.2.4.3.2 above for details of outputs). [ ]{.underline}
NOTE: The test results and data may be collected from test execution instance
run by the vendor test team as part of its product development cycle.
#### 5.2.4.4 Basic Vulnerability Testing
Basic Vulnerability Testing activities consist of requirements for running
automated Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) security testing tools against the external interfaces of a Network
Product. Such tools or equivalent alternatives are likely available to all
kind of attackers.
NOTE 1: As Basic Vulnerability Testing is universally applicable for all
Network Product Classes, the requirements for this testing category are
expected to be specified as a general SCAS module. This general SCAS module
will then be linked and potentially amended by SCASs for individual Network
Product Classes.
NOTE 2: The requirements in this testing category are kept general, the
wildcard [protocol] indicates a placeholder for the actual protocol relevant
as it is implemented in the Network Product and made available on external
interfaces. The protocols for which the individual Basic Vulnerability Testing
activities will be required are to be selected during the normative phase.
NOTE 3: The individual tools used for Basic Vulnerability Testing are selected
by the Security Compliance Testing laboratories. The SECAM accreditation body
will ensure during laboratory accreditation that the testers are able to
utilize adequate tools.
NOTE 4: To avoid creating a monopoly for security testing tool vendors the
usage of a security testing tool having specific capabilities should only be
mandatory if there are at least two alternatives by different vendors
available for use in most world regions.
This activity covers at least three aspects: Port Scanning, Vulnerability
Scanner by the use of Vulnerability scanners and robustness/fuzz testing.
Details can be found in Annex A.2.1. The Basic Vulnerability Testing
laboratories shall provide to the operator:
\- the test procedures [following SCAS (see Annex A.2.1)]
\- the test results [following SCAS output format indications (see Annex
A.2.1)]
#### 5.2.4.5 Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis task
NOTE 1: Threat assessment data and description of key assets of network
products provided by the vendors will help the evaluator in understanding the
product under evaluation. It is FFS which documents are needed to fulfil this
need. This will be subject of a dedicated future Study Item on EVA.
NOTE 2: Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis will be done based on SCAS scope
NOTE 3: As for how to do the Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis the SCAS document
may provide a test description and an indication of the tools and test methods
to be used (see 5.3.4.4.3 Activities).
NOTE 4: In the current version of the TR it is not clear in which document and
by whom the set of tools and methods to be used for this task will be defined.
This must be clarified. This will be subject of a dedicated future Study Item
on EVA.
##### 5.3.4.4.1 Inputs
The test bed configured according to the documentation produced in step 2 (see
5.2.4.2.2)
##### 5.3.4.4.2 Outputs
Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis laboratories execute the tests for the
evaluated network product, collect evaluation evidences and include them in
the final security vulnerability test report, which will include at least
(following a document \"Test Methodology and skills requirements\" :
\- Declaration about who carried out the tests (e.g. self-evaluation or third
party Evaluators).
\- the test procedure, including
> \- the attack paths and vectors used for the tests;
>
> \- Vulnerability library to which this test refers to
>
> \- The reference model/method/testing tool used for Enhanced vulnerability
> analysis.
>
> \- Network products/features tested and reasons for not testing where
> applicable.
\- The test results [following SCAS output format indications] containing
\- Vulnerabilities that were to be tested and correctly addressed by the
product,
\- Residual vulnerabilities not addressed by the product;
\- A list of these residual vulnerabilities prioritized by their e.g. CVSS
score, with the associated risks to which the operator can be exposed to. The
impact assessment about exploitable vulnerabilities in the network product are
based on the deployment assumptions listed in the SCAS, e.g. the possibility
that vulnerability can be used for attacking, e.g. remote attacking, how
serious damage can be made through this vulnerability, etc.
Editor note: It is FFS which ones of these elements should be archived in
tester premises (for confidentiality reasons); included in the evaluation
report; included in the instantiated SCAS.
NOTE: The EVA report should not be issued to the public, it can only be kept
between the party generating the report and the party receiving the report.
##### 5.3.4.4.3 Activities
EVA of a network product could e.g. consist in exploiting vulnerabilities for
a given attacker model for EVA.\ An attacker model for EVA consists in a scale
of attacker type and levels; levels could be determined by a list of criteria
such as expertise or time available for the attack. This attacker model for
EVA could be defined in the SCAS.\ This definition could be used for two
different activities:
\- the accreditation of testing laboratories (verification by the SECAM
Accreditation Body that the testing laboratories have the skills)
\- during the evaluation itself. The accredited tester only performs attacks
(time, material...) that are in line with the model defined in the SCAS
Testers could use:
\- Publicly available information on vulnerabilities coming from a range of
known vulnerabilities documented in some vulnerability library, e.g. CVE
(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, \"a publicly available and free to use
list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common computer
vulnerabilities and exposures\" by the MITRE Corporation, an US not-for-profit
organization. http://cve.mitre.org/), CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration, \"a
community-developed dictionary of software weakness types\" also by the MITRE
Corporation. http://cwe.mitre.org/) , and other FIRST (Forum for Incident
Response and Security Teams, \"brings together computer security incident
response teams from government, commercial, and educational organizations\",
http://www.first.org/), TCG (Trusted Computing Group, \"a not-for-profit
organization formed to develop, define and promote open, vendor-neutral,
global industry standards, supportive of a hardware-based root of trust, for
interoperable trusted computing platforms.\", www.trustedcomputinggroup.org)
identified vulnerabilities etc.
\- Attack paths definition
\- More advanced tools than those used for Basic Vulnerability Testing
Editor\'s note: Clarification on what \"Attack path\" means, in which document
this will be defined and by which entity (SA3 or SECAM Accreditation Body) is
needed. This will be subject of a dedicated future Study Item on EVA.
### 5.2.5 Self-declaration
After the evaluation process is finished, the vendors review all the
evaluation results of the product and give a declaration of their product. In
the self-declaration, vendors should
  * give a short summary and conclusion of all the evaluation reports
  * declare all tests conducted by the vendors are correctly carried out and all the documents provided by the vendors are authentic without intentional deception.
Editor\'s note: Further details can be provided after the study phase.
NOTE: Ideally both vendors and operators would prefer everything (all tests,
requirements, processes etc.) are passed or met, but in reality there may be
vulnerabilities in a product or security functions that are not fully
developed. A self-declaration doesn\'t mean all security requirements are met
or no vulnerabilities can be found in the product. The self-declaration can
also imply partial compliance. The vendors need to summarize the evaluation
results truthfully in self-declaration. It is up to the operators to make the
final decision whether the product can be accepted or not.
### 5.2.6 Operator security acceptance decision
The operator examines the network product, the security compliance testing,
basic vulnerability testing and Enhanced vulnerability analysis reports, the
self-declaration as well as the testing laboratories certificate published by
the . SECAM Accreditation Body and decides if the results are sufficient
according to its internal policies. In particular, the operator can perform a
sample of the security compliance testing, basic vulnerability testing or
enhanced vulnerability analysis, based on the delivered test procedures.
The vendors and third-party laboratories accreditation documents monitored and
maintained by the SECAM Accreditation Body attest the trustworthiness of these
actors and can help operators in their security acceptance decisions.
### 5.2.7 Administration of the accreditations and dispute resolution
#### 5.2.7.1 Monitoring
The SECAM Accreditation Body monitors three kinds of accredited actors within
the scheme:
\- Vendors development processes, which are expected to comply with the
Security Assurance Process
\- Security compliance testing laboratories, which are expected to comply with
the Test Methodology and skills requirements
\- Basic Vulnerability Testing laboratories, which are expected to comply with
the Test Methodology and skills requirements
\- Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis laboratories, which are expected to comply
with the Test Methodology and skills requirements
Monitoring activities lead the SECAM Accreditation Body to maintain the status
of these actors (accredited or not accredited)
#### 5.2.7.2 Dispute resolution
The SECAM Accreditation Body must provide a process to resolve conflicts when
an accredited operator shows evidence of inconsistencies in:
\- Vendor Development process activities (inconsistencies in analysis of
compliance against Security assurance process);
\- Security compliance testing laboratories activities (inconsistencies in
analysis of compliance against SCAS);
\- Basic Vulnerability Testing laboratories activities (inconsistencies in
analysis or use of the output of the BVT tools);
\- Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis laboratories activities (inconsistencies in
analysis of residual vulnerabilities).
The SECAM Accreditation Body typically performs a supplementary audit on
vendor / third-party laboratories premises and updates their accreditation
records.
In the event that evaluation findings in the evaluation report are in dispute
for a network product (for example: by re-doing the tests an operator finds
opposite results to the ones provided by the vendors or third-party
laboratories in the evaluation report), this methodology also provides a
conflict resolution and revocation mechanism. This case is believed to be rare
and would arise if one or several of the actors (vendors or third-party
laboratories) are cheating in the evaluation or compilation of evaluation
results of a 3GPP network product.
The entity responsible for deciding that a declaration should be revoked,
based on the evidences and the details of the dispute procedure, is the SECAM
Accreditation Body. GSMA might be a good candidate as they are already
involved in GCF and GSMA SAS scheme
(http://www.gsma.com/technicalprojects/fraud-security/security-accreditation-
scheme).
At the end of the dispute procedure, if the entity responsible for it decides
so, the accreditation of the different actors would be revoked and added to
the accreditation revocation list. Consequently, results of network products
evaluations for evaluations conducted by these revoked actors would be
considered untrusted.

### 5.2.9 General considerations
#### 5.2.9.1 Improvement of SCAS and new security requirements
Vendors, operators or other bodies can propose new security requirements for
addition to 3GPP standards (SCAS) if a new threat or vulnerability has been
identified. This gives SA3 the flexibility to continuously review and improve
their SCAS(es) (including security compliance checklist, basic vulnerability
checklist as well as enhanced vulnerability analysis checklist).
#### 5.2.9.2 Partial compliance and use of SECAM requirements in network
product development cycle
The vendor is likely to integrate SECAM requirements and test cases in its
continuous development process process. During this phase, a given network
product might fail fully or partially some of the SECAM compliance and/or
vulnerability test. The process of how and when vendor choose to fix or not to
fix this network product before the final evaluation is under vendor's
responsibility and is outside of SECAM scope.
SECAM scheme will describe the final evaluation for the final network product
version expected to be bought by operators. SECAM encourages vendors to aim at
a full compliance of all SECAM requirements which should represent a minimum
baseline. However, the final network product might still only partially fulfil
SECAM requirements. This partial compliance will be documented in the
evaluation report results. The final security acceptance decision is under
operators' control which might accept partially compliant products. This
choice is under operators' responsibility and is outside of SECAM scope.
#### 5.2.9.3 Comparison between two SECAM evaluations
SECAM evaluation considers a given version of a network product. SECAM
documents will have no sections or evaluation of the improvement between two
evaluations.
# 6 Criteria for the evaluation of the methodologies
Editor\'s Note: This clause will list the criteria that will be used to
evaluate the proposed solution (type of attacks conducted, reproducibility of
the tests, costs, international recognition, need for coordination with other
bodies ...)
Editor\'s note: Part of the methodologies relates to producing SCAS another
part of the methodologies relates to evaluating how product are fulfilling
requirements of these SCAS. Criteria\'s addressing both aspects have to be
defined.
The 3GPP security assurance methodology under consideration should be
evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:
NOTE: Effort required for security assurance should be commensurate with
confidence gain. Therefore candidate methodologies may not necessarily need to
meet all the criteria of this clause in order to be considered viable.
\- Reproducibility -- ability of a particular 3GPP security assurance
methodology to produce identical results when applied to the same target at a
different time, place, or by a different actor
\- Repeatability (or test-retest reliability) -- ability of a particular 3GPP
security assurance methodology given identical inputs and conditions to
produce identical test results
\- Ability to model different attacker potentials and different operational
environments, allowing traceability and verification of security
requirements\' sufficiency with respect to attacker/environmental assumptions.
\- Current as well as anticipated international recognition -- an official
acknowledgement and mutual acceptance of a particular 3GPP security assurance
methodology as well as its evaluation results by various agencies, consortia,
and standard bodies belonging to more than one country. Anticipated
international recognition, as well as current international recognition have
to be considered when evaluating a particular 3GPP security assurance
methodology
\- Coordination with other standard bodies -- established use or consideration
for certification by standard bodies other than 3GPP
\- Expandability -- ability of a particular 3GPP security assurance
methodology to be expanded to a different industry
\- Component isolation and ability to reuse pre-certified components --
ability to isolate a component of a system for its certification and
subsequent re-use as a pre-certified element of another system
\- Duration and complexity (cost) of testing cycle -- each 3GPP security
assurance methodology has anticipated complexity and duration of its testing
cycle. In many circumstances, shorter anticipated duration and lower levels of
complexity are preferable
\- Ability to offer incremental testing, as well as the duration and
complexity (cost) of such incremental testing cycle -- each 3GPP security
assurance methodology might have an anticipated complexity and duration of its
testing cycle when an already certified 3GPP product is updated or modified.
\- Current as well as anticipated adoption rate -- some methodologies have
better adoption rate in the telecom industry than others. Anticipated adoption
rate, as well as current adoption rate have to be considered when evaluating a
particular 3GPP security assurance methodology
\- Third party or self-testing options -- some methodologies allow self-
evaluation and self-declaration by manufacturers, while some other schemes
allow only independent, third-party testing by dedicated agents. This property
has to be considered when evaluating a particular 3GPP security assurance
methodology
\- Ability of the 3GPP security assurance methodology to provide measurable
results -- measurable results of the process is considered to be one of the
important properties which has to be considered when evaluating a particular
3GPP security assurance methodology
Editor\'s note: The use of the word \"measurable\" is still to be defined.
\- Ability of the 3GPP security assurance methodology to allow specifying a
set of tests to be performed on the target network products \-- this
possibility is fundamental to verify if security requirements are correctly
implemented on the target network products.
\- Ability of the 3GPP security assurance methodology to support different
assurance levels.
\- Ability of the 3GPP security assurance methodology to support different
categories corresponding to the desired security baselines for the network
products (see 4.5.2.3). The intent of this distinction is for the security
objectives to reflect the differing security requirements due, for example, to
the exposed or unexposed location of a network product. A network product is
to be evaluated for one security baseline or another, but not to be evaluated
and certified under multiple different baselines.
Editor\'s note: Whether it is desirable for a higher security baseline to be
inclusive of, and incremental to a lower one is TBD. Such level inclusiveness
is to be defined by each methodology.
Editor\'s Note: Definition of exposed or unexposed location of a network
product is FFS.
\- Ability of the 3GPP security assurance methodology to focus on the part of
the network product which is relevant for the evaluation of the network
product according to SECAM ('scoping of network product\').
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS what is relevant for evaluation according to SECAM,
in particular whether it suffices for such an evaluation to evaluate against
SCASs, or whether the evaluation can go beyond this and consider threats not
addressed by any SCAS.
\- Ability of the 3GPP security assurance methodology to support metrics for
measuring and comparing improvement in product security from release to
release
\- Agility - Ability of the 3GPP security assurance methodology to adapt
quickly to new development of attack vectors, tools and techniques.
\- Effort, e.g. \"time\", \"money\", \"human resource\", required for the
continuous usage and maintenance by 3GPP of the security assurance
methodology.
# 7 Comparison of Proposed Methodologies
Editor\'s Note: This clause will contain a comparison of the proposed
solutions according to the criteria defined in clause 7.
# 8 Conclusions
## 8.1 Chosen methodology description
The present study defines the scope and threat model related to security
assurance of 3GPP network products (the terminology \"network product\" is
clarified in clause 4.1).
The study introduced two methods (more details can be found in clause 5):
\- The first one consists in applying Common Criteria methodology, but not
necessarily within the Common Criteria scheme which would require a
certification by national Certification Bodies
\- The second one consists in defining a tailored method, but does not prevent
the re-use of some Common Criteria notions during the building process
Methodology 2 is chosen for SECAM. It integrates Common Criteria concepts
where efficient and provides the necessary adaptation to 3GPP context where
necessary (need to allow accredited self-evaluation, single assurance level
and security baseline...)
\- SECAM is built upon an analysis of threats on the considered network
products
\- SECAM will follow a Security Assurance process to demonstrate how these
threats are covered by tests
\- SECAM will be mainly based on different Security Assurance Specifications,
related to a given (set of) network product(s) class(es), which include
security requirements with associated test cases
\- SECAM will consider a single security baseline and a single assurance level
per network product class for evaluation (see 4.5.2).
\- The security baseline is defined as a set of security requirements and
environmental assumptions defining the capacity of the network product(s) to
resist a given attack potential. Consequently:
\- Each network product can be evaluated only against a single security
baseline
\- The security baseline of a network product class cannot be compared to the
security baseline of another network product class
\- SECAM considers a single assurance level per network product class for the
evaluation of the security requirements as well as for the vendors\'
development and lifecycle management process. This means evaluating network
products:
\- At constant scope (i.e. a single process will be followed for a given
network product class, which will be relevant to this class)
\- At constant depth (which is mainly a black-box approach with occasional and
justified usage of grey- or white-box testing)
\- At constant evaluation rigour
\- SECAM assessment will distinguish between
\- Security Compliance testing (see 5.2.4.3)
\- Basic Vulnerability testing (see 5.2.4.4)
\- Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis (see 5.2.4.5)
\- SECAM will rely on a SECAM Accreditation Body to build trust in the actors
of the scheme:
\- The vendor, developing the network product
\- The security compliance testing laboratories, assessing the network product
compliance with its SCAS
\- The basic vulnerability testing laboratories, assessing the network product
using tools, settings and procedures described in Basic Vulnerability testing
clause (5.2.4.4)
\- The Enhanced vulnerability analysis testing laboratories, assessing whether
the network product resists the attacker model defined in the SCAS; (this
second step of vulnerability testing being intended to assess resistance to
more advanced attacks)
\- The accredited actors are trusted to undertake the corresponding evaluation
tasks. The SECAM Accreditation Body will define dispute process and revocation
processes
The table below summarizes the keys differences and similarities between
Methodology 2 and Common Criteria with the rationale for the adaptations made

The | | | | method favours a | | | | single accreditation | | | | for development | | | | processes than | | | | having assurance | | | | requirements to be | | | | assessed during | | | | evaluation. This | | | | also is intended to | | | | help vendors | | | | achieving economy of | | | | scale when several | | | | products are | | | | evaluated. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Assurance levels | - Each network | - CC is built to | | | product class has a | leave possibility to | | | dedicated assurance | have EAL2 and EAL4 | | | level defined by a | evaluations on the | | | single set of | same product class | | | requirements. | | | | Although there will | | | | be overlaps, | | | | different network | | | | products classes | | | | typically will have | | | | a different set of | | | | requirements, and | | | | may undergo | | | | different | | | | verification | | | | activities | | | | | | | | - Some network | | | | product classes may | | | | require more | | | | extensive assurance | | | | activities than | | | | others, but that | | | | does not mean they | | | | reach higher level | | | | of security. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | **Rationale:** A | | | | detailed rationale | | | | for this topic can | | | | be found in 3GPP TR | | | | 33.805, Â§4.5.2.2 and | | | | 4.5.2.3 | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Security Assurance | - The SCAS covers a | | | Specification | similar scope as a | | | | CC Protection | | | | Profile combined | | | | with supporting | | | | documents addressing | | | | the test methodology | | | | | | | | - A SCAS must be | | | | instantiated in a | | | | similar way as, in | | | | CC, a PP is | | | | instantiated to a | | | | ST. | | | | | | | | - Methodology 2 is | | | | also inspired from | | | | CPA Security | | | | Characteristics, | | | | where the test | | | | methods are | | | | localized together | | | | with the security | | | | requirements they | | | | intend to test. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | **Rationale:** The | | | | process for the | | | | derivation of | | | | security | | | | requirements is | | | | heavily inspired | | | | from the CC | | | | framework adapted to | | | | deal with the | | | | already existing | | | | 3GPP security | | | | requirement and to | | | | ensure a maximum | | | | reuse of existing | | | | requirements where | | | | appropriate.

It | | | | builds upon the fact | | | | that requirements | | | | will not have to be | | | | available in | | | | different | | | | \"levels\". About | | | | adding the test | | | | method to the | | | | requirements: the | | | | first goal of this | | | | approach is to | | | | ensure the shared | | | | comprehension of | | | | \"what is to be | | | | verified for each | | | | requirement\". In | | | | CC, this information | | | | would be distributed | | | | between CC Part3, | | | | the CEM and | | | | supporting | | | | documents. | | | | | | | | Having functional, | | | | hardening and | | | | assurance tests | | | | related to the | | | | network product in | | | | the same compliance | | | | testing process of | | | | the SCAS allows | | | | having a consistent | | | | test plan for the | | | | evaluation of | | | | functionalities as | | | | well as security | | | | architecture of the | | | | network product. CC | | | | focuses its | | | | compliance testing | | | | on functionality | | | | only (most hardening | | | | requirements being | | | | only described in | | | | ADV_ARC and being | | | | indirectly verified | | | | during vulnerability | | | | testing). | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE 1: The comparison table above is between Methodology 2 and Common
Criteria within the CCRA. As Methodology 1 intends to use the CC framework as
a model outside of the CCRA, the above comparison might thus not apply to
Methodology 1 directly.
NOTE 2: This comparison is made with the CCRA methodology as it is currently.
However the CCRA are in the process of making significant changes to their
methodology, in particular to replace the 7 Evaluation Assurance Levels with a
single common level -- the collaborative Protection Profile.
## 8.2 Next steps for the normative phase
Clause 5.2.2 describes the expected content of the methodology building
process. SA3 will focus on security compliance and basic vulnerability testing
first, in order to improve maturity progressively amongst all partners, before
beginning to define Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis. An SCAS for security
compliance requirements can include requirements on hardening and General
Security Testing.
**[Step 1 (organisational setup)]{.underline}**
The methodology building will start with an organizational setup:
\- Definition of working way within 3GPP (within SA3, subgroup...)
\- Establish way of communication with external group working to prepare
accreditation body, e.g. GSMA subgroup
**[Step 2 (building the pilot SCAS, the development and lifecycle requirements
and the accreditation requirements)]{.underline}**
3GPP will define a first set of SCAS for one \"pilot\" network product class
through:
\- A consensus on the threats related to the network product
\- A consensus on requirements needed to cover these threats,
\- Formalization into
\- an SCAS including:
\- Security Requirements (including hardening requirements) and the associated
test cases
\- Basic Vulnerability Testing activities
\- Development and lifecycle requirements
3GPP may also enter a dialogue with the Accreditation and Conflict Resolution
Body on
\- accreditation and monitoring rules
**[Step 3 organisational setup of dry-run]{.underline}**
  * Agreements with industry partners for a dry-run of \"pilot\" SCAS for one or several network product class(es) (compliance only)
  * Definition of confidentiality rules for sensitive information handling
  * The accreditation body is invited to join this agreement for the purpose of organising a dry-run for accreditation. Such a joint agreement would usefully contain provisions on sharing knowledge of the dry-run results.
**[Step 4 (dry run of SCAS evaluation and vendor/tester
accreditation)]{.underline}**
Industry partners will perform a dry-run of the **[SCAS]{.underline}**
evaluation scheme on the basis of the \"pilot\" SCAS from step 2 and the
agreement in step 3.
\- Evaluate example network products from the selected network product class
against the pilot SCAS
\- 3GPP invites the accreditation body to perform a dry-run for accreditation
with the actors such as compliance testing laboratories that have volunteered
in step 3
**[Step 5 (SCAS finalisation)]{.underline}**
Normative workgroup will complete the pilot SCASs, using the insight from the
dry-run, and turn it into a 3GPP spec
\- Correction of assurance, and compliance testing requirements, including
hardening and General Security Testing requirements
The normative workgroup and Accreditation and Conflict Resolution Body is
invited to also
\- refine accreditation and monitoring rules, as well as test methodology and
skill requirements for compliance testing laboratories, and make the binding
rules available to SECAM stakeholders / the public at large
**[Step 6 (Start of official evaluations)]{.underline}**
3GPP will declare the SCAS(s) for the selected network product class ready for
use in SECAM-compliant evaluations by approving the corresponding specs in SA
plenary.
NOTE: SECAM allows that vendor, 3^rd^ party test labs if applicable, and
operators use evaluations based on approved SCASs according to mutual
agreements, independent of the accreditation body.
The Accreditation and Conflict Resolution Body may launch officially
accreditations. Actors having performed pilot evaluations, as vendors or
compliance testing laboratories, may benefit from the fact that some of the
dry-run accreditation may be re-used if no change occurred wrt to the final
accreditation rules in the relevant part.
NOTE: In parallel to step 6, 3GPP may launch the editing of other SCASs
**[Step 7 (addition of Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis)]{.underline}**
Building on experience from the security improvement of the previous
evaluations and of their limits, SA3 will launch a new study on addition of
Enhanced Vulnerability Analysis into the running evaluation scope to further
improve security.
###### ### Annex A: Application of the methodologies
# A.1 Application of Methodology 1
# A.2 Application of Methodology 2
## A.2.1 Basic Vulnerability Testing: examples of test cases
\- Requirement name: Port Scanning
\- Requirement reference: BVT-PortScanning
\- Requirement description: Port Scanners reveal open ports. Their output can
be used to verify that all running services are explicitly documented and
thereby it can be assured that no undocumented or untested service posing a
potential security risk is running on the Network Product during operation.
\- Test case:
\- Run port scanner for [protocol] on all external interfaces providing
[protocol].
\- Verify that the output of port scans reflects the services documented to be
available on the respective interface of the Network Product. Also it needs to
be ensured that all services identified by the port scanners are subject to
respective tests of other Basic Vulnerability Testing tool categories.
\- Requirement evidences: A document in free form describing: the list of
services listening identified on each external interface as well as the
pointer in the vendor's documentation describing this service. Derivations
between documentation and test must be explained by the Network Product vendor
and recorded in this document.
\- Requirement name: Vulnerability Scanning
**-** Requirement reference**:** BVT-VulnerabilityScanning
\- Requirement description: Vulnerability Scanners check whether known
vulnerabilities and other known security shortcomings are present in the
tested system. Vulnerability scanners usually check the protocols they are
intended for (e.g. TCP/IP and UDP/IP) as well as the services on top of it.
Issues identified by those tools usually cover the whole range of possible
vulnerabilities.
\- Test case:
\- Run vulnerability scanner for [protocol] on all external interfaces
providing [protocol].
\- Perform a Vulnerability Assessment of the issues identified: Evaluate
issues according to CVSS score or other suitable scoring mechanisms.
\- Requirement evidences: A document in free form describing: all the
identified issues by the tools and their scores. Those issues falling into a
medium, high or critical category need to be highlighted and assessed for
actual impact in the use case of the Network Product in question.
\- Requirement name: Robustness Testing
**-** Requirement reference**:** BVT-RobustnessTesting
**-** Requirement Description**:** Robustness Testing (\"fuzzing\") tools
identify issues in protocols which might occur when unexpected input is
provided. Issues identified by those tools could e.g. lead to denial of
service vulnerabilities.
\- Test case:
\- Run robustness testing tool for [protocol] on all external interfaces
providing [protocol].
\- Perform a Vulnerability Assessment of the issues identified: Evaluate
issues according to calculated CVSS score or other suitable scoring
mechanisms.
\- Requirement evidences: A document in free form describing: all the
identified issues by the tools and their scores. Those issues falling into a
medium, high or critical category need to be highlighted and assessed for
actual impact in the use case of the Network Product in question. This could
e.g. mean that the testing report states that an unauthenticated remote
attacker may force the Network Product to restart by sending certain protocol
input.
## A.2.2 Security compliance testing: example of security requirements with
test cases
NOTE 1: The requirements in this were written using the initial template for
security requirements approved at SA3#70. This "old" template is slightly
different from the one described in 5.2.2.4.2.3.3 of Methodology 2. The
mapping from one template to the other is however straightforward by adding a
"threat reference" and splitting "test case" into "Test case" and "Requirement
evidences". These requirements will thus not be updated.
### A.2.2.1 Network Product Remote Management
Remote management of a 3GPP network product consists of functions, methods and
protocols enabling its management from an external device (e.g. a computer
located in a different network). The remote management shall be protected and
robust against cyber-attacks. If this feature is exploited, it could be
difficult for the MNO to recover or stabilize the network. In order to prevent
that the Remote Management feature is exploited, some relevant security
requirements have been identified and described in the following clauses.
Requirement 1: Traffic Protection
**Reference:** Remote Management Traffic Protection -- RM-TP
**Description:** All management traffic shall be protected by integrity and
encryption; unprotected sessions shall not be accepted. The remote access
methods can support natively traffic encryption such as HTTPS, SSHv2 or can be
based on lower tunnelling protocol (IPsec VPN, TLS VPN).
The cryptographic algorithm used shall not be affected by known
vulnerabilities and crypto-analytic attacks.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about the algorithms used and compare
the list to reference bases of known vulnerabilities
\- Verify that plaintext Remote Management sessions are not accepted by the
network product
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 2: Management Protocols
**Reference:** Remote Management Protocols -- RM-MP
**Description:** The remote management can support one or more remote access
protocol. All the supported protocols shall be robust against known
vulnerabilities.
The most secure and robust implementation shall be supported e.g. SSHv2 shall
be preferable to SSHv1, SNMPv3 shall be implemented if the management via SNMP
trap is supported.
Moreover protocols such as Telnet, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 shall not be supported as
well as FTP. If the network product supports one or more of the above listed
protocols, then by default they should be disabled and only enabled by network
product administrator.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufactures details about the supported protocols and
compare the list to reference bases of known vulnerabilities and security
threats.
\- Verify if the protocols which should be not supported are really
unavailable on the target network product. For the protocols which are
supposed to be supported, verify that in the default configuration they are
disabled (and that can be enabled exclusively by the network product
administrator)
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 3: IP Restriction
**Reference:** Remote Management Access IP Restriction -- RM-IPRE
**Description:** The network product administrator shall be able to deploy
Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the network product to limit the IP addresses
or networks from which the network product can be remotely managed.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify that is not possible to access to the network product from a not
allowed IP addresses or networks
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 4: User Restriction
**Reference:** Remote Management Access User Restriction -- RM-USRE
**Description:** The network product administrator shall be able to define on
each target network product which users are allowed to perform remote
administration and their permissions/privileges.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify that the User Restriction policy is correctly supported and enforced
on the target network product
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 5: User Authentication
**Reference:** Remote Management Access User Authentication -- RM-USAUTH
**Description:** Remote access to the target network product shall be granted
only to authenticated (remote management) users.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify that unauthenticated access attempts to the target network product
are rejected.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
### A.2.2.2 Network Product Local Management
Local management of a target network product consists of functions and methods
allowing its management directly through a local connection (e.g. directly
from its console). Considering the security of a network product, the local
management shall be secure (i.e. authenticated and protected). If this feature
is exploited, it could be difficult for the MNO to recover or stabilize the
network. In order to prevent that the Network Product Local Management feature
is exploited, some relevant security requirements have been identified and
described in the following clauses.
Requirement 1: User Authentication
**Reference:** Local Management Access User Authentication -- LM-USAUTH
**Description:** Local access to the target network product shall be granted
only to authenticated (local management) users.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify that unauthenticated access attempts to the target network product
are rejected
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 2: Strong User Authentication
**Reference:** Local Management Strong Authentication -- LM-SUSAUTH
**Description:** The user allowed to access the network product via console
(i.e. directly through a local connection) shall be authenticated using a
strong multifactor authentication mechanism based on PIN + One Time Password
(OTP), smartcards and/or biometrics elements.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify if the Strong User Authentication policy is implemented and enforced
on the target network product (e.g. if management users attempting to
authenticate themselves to the target network product with traditional
\"username and password\" scheme are rejected).
**Target network product classe(s):** Exposed
Requirement 3: User Restriction
**Reference:** Local Management Access User Restriction -- LM-USRE
**Description:** The network product administrator shall be able to define on
each target network product which users are allowed to perform local
administration and their permissions/privileges.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify that the User Restriction policy is correctly supported and enforced
on the target network product.
Target network product classe(s): All
### A.2.2.3 Password Management
Passwords can control access to resource of the network product or to the
network product itself. This is accomplished through the definition of a
secret allowing to authenticate and authorize the requests to the target
network product. When a request is received, by the target network product the
request is challenged for password and identity verification. Depending on the
result of the verification process, the access can be granted, denied or
limited. For security best practice, for all users an external authentication
server (AAA) should be preferred. Locally configured password shall be still
configured in the case of a server or network failure, but the network product
can also have other passwords/secrets within its configuration (e.g. NTP key,
SNMP community string and so on), so the problem of password management is
fundamental even if an external AAA server is used. In order to prevent that
the Password Management feature is exploited, some relevant security
requirements have been identified and described in the following clauses.
Requirement 1: External Authentication Server
**Reference:** Password Management External Authentication Server -- PM-
EXTAUTHSRV
**Description:** As security best practice, passwords should be managed by
external authentication server based on Radius or Diameter protocols.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify that the feature is effectively supported.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 2: Local Password Storage
**Reference:** Password Management Local Storage -- PM-LS
**Description:** Password/secret stored locally in the network product shall
be protected using strong algorithms.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about this feature
\- Verify that the algorithms used to store the secrets within the target
network product are robust and not vulnerable to known attacks (e.g. password
recovering using brute force attacks shall not be possible).
\- If passwords are locally stored in the target network product using hash
functions, verify that SHA-256 or SHA-1 is used (and that MD5 is not used).
\- If passwords are locally stored using encryption algorithm, check that this
encryption algorithm is not vulnerable to known crypto-attacks.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 3: Password Lockout
**Reference:** Password Lockout -- PM-PLO
**Description:** The network product shall detect repeated invalid attempts to
sign into an account with incorrect passwords during a short period of time to
lock out the user\'s account and prevent further attempts, at least for a
certain period of time. If N invalid attempts to login to the same account are
made during an interval of Tdetect minutes, then the account is disabled for
Tlockout minutes (after that period lockout is cleared).
While this mechanism is effective against concerted attacks against a single
account, it does nothing to prevent an intruder from simultaneously trying to
guess the passwords of many users. A more sophisticated mechanism might extend
this as follows: If M invalid login attempts are made from network address A,
to any account, during an interval of Tdetect minutes, then the address A is
disabled for Tlockout minutes.
The parameters N, M Tdetect and Tlockout shall be set to default values which
can be set and changed exclusively by the network product administrator.
This mechanism shall be applied only to users, exempting at least one
administrator login. This limits the scope of denial of service attacks.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain from the Manufacturer details about both features
\- Verify that the set values for N, M, Tdetect and Tlockout are properly
handled after failed login attempts (e.g. accounts are blocked after N failed
attempts).
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 4: No Service Password Recovery
**Reference:** No service password recovery-- PM-NSPR
**Description:** Many network devices have a function that resets the current
system password (password recovery). This function shall be disabled. If this
is not possible, it shall be ensured that an attacker cannot gain access to
the configuration of the network device. For this, the entire configuration of
the network device shall be irretrievably deleted in the event that the system
password is reset.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain and verify documentation on the password recovery procedures for the
target network product.
\- Verify that this functionality is disabled or if it is enabled check that
the entire configuration of the network device was irretrievably deleted.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 5: No Blank Password
**Reference:** No blank password-- PM-NBP
**Description:** It shall be impossible configure blank local passwords. Note
that when an external authentication server is used, a policy preventing the
configuration of blank passwords on the external authentication server should
be implemented.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain and verify documentation on this feature for the target network
product
\- Verify that local blank passwords cannot be configured on the target
network product
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 6: Enforce Password History
**Reference:** Password history -- PM-EPH
**Description:** The network product shall support the possibility to
determine the number of unique new passwords that have to be associated with a
user account before an old password can be reused. This policy enables
administrators to enhance security by ensuring that old passwords are not
reused continually. This mechanism should be applied to all user accounts
configured on the network product.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain and verify documentation on the password recovery procedures
\- Verify that when this feature is enabled, it is not possible to reuse old
passwords.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 7: Enforce Strong Passwords
**Reference:** Enforce Strong Passwords-- PM-ESP
**Description:** The network product shall support the possibility to define
password policy so that all user accounts are protected with strong passwords.
This policy should be enabled by default with a default rule.

### A.2.2.4 Software
Software bugs can introduce vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an
attacker to breach the network product (for example to gain root privileges).
Software bugs stem generally from an insecure/poor application design, an
insecure code developing, improper flaws and can fall into a fairly small
number of broad categories which include memory safety (e.g. buffer overflow
and dangling pointer bugs), race condition, secure input and output handling,
faulty use of an API, improper use case handling, improper exception handling,
pre-processing input strings after they are checked for being acceptable, etc.

### A.2.2.6 Network Services
Preventing suspicious network traffic from reaching a certain network product
is a fundamental way to minimize the risk of several cyber-attacks (e.g. DoS
attacks). In order to prevent that Network Services feature is exploited, some
relevant security requirements have been identified and described in the
following clauses.
Requirement 1: Traffic Filtering
**Reference** : Traffic Filtering -- NS-TF
**Description:** One of the fundamental functions of network products is the
control of data traffic on the basis of the IP destination and sender
addresses as well as the used ports and protocol status. A network product
shall therefore support filters (e.g., access control lists, local firewall,
etc.) to regulate incoming and outgoing traffic on the basis of address
information, services (ports) and protocol statuses and types. These can be
used to route packets through the network device as well as to accept or
reject packets sent to one of the network product\'s addresses on the basis of
defined criteria.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain and verify documentation on local inbound/outbound filters for the
network product
\- Verify that after applying filtering rules on specific
ports/protocols/interfaces (for example on IPsec and SSH traffic allowed as
inbound traffic) that these rules are effectively enforced
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 2: IP Anti-Spoofing
**Reference:** IP Anti-Spoofing -- NS-IPAS
Description: This type of attack allows a host, application or a malicious
network product to mimic the actions of a genuine network product. Typically
the attacker pretends to be an innocent host by reusing its IP addresses in
network packets. In order to protect against this type of attack the target
network product should implement anti-spoofing mechanisms, e.g. to reject
packet with invalid source addresses, coming from unexpected interface, etc...
**Test case:**
\- Obtain and verify documentation on this feature
\- Verify that spoofed packets are rejected
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 3: Tunnelling in GTP
**Reference:** GTP Tunnelling -- NS-GTPTN
**Description** : This attack could pose a moderate security threat. It may be
possible for attackers to wrap attack traffic in GTP Version 0 or 1 Packet,
which has another embedded GTP Packet as part of its payload. As GTP is used
to encapsulate packets originating from a mobile station, it is possible for a
mobile station to create a GTP packet and forward it along to the SGSN.
Upon receiving the GTP packet, the SGSN will encode it again, and forward it
to the GGSN, through the relative PDP context. This embedded GTP packet may be
potentially decoded via the GGSN and forwarded into the GGSN infrastructure,
or decoded a second time, allowing an attacker to spoof GTP packets coming
from a range of different answers. Another potential attack would be attackers
sending recursive GTP packets, which is a GTP packet that contains X number of
other GTP packets embedded within.
**Test case:**
\- Examine incoming packet for possible exploitation code in the embedded GTP
data fields.
**Target network product classe(s):** MME/SGSN, GGSSN
### A.2.2.7 3GPP Capability Configuration
Preventing unsecure configurations deployment of 3GPP features can be a
fundamental way forward to minimize the risk of several cyber-attacks. In
order to prevent that the Configuration Security feature is exploited, some
relevant security requirements have been identified and described in the
following clauses.
Requirement 1: Security Algorithm Modification
**Reference:** Security Algorithm Modification -- CC-SAM
**Description:** It shall not be possible from unauthorized access, to modify
security algorithms supported by the target network product, e.g. to perform a
downgrade attack by configuring the use of a weaker algorithm.
**Test case:**
\- Verify that the security algorithm configuration cannot be modified from
unauthorized users.
**Target network product classe(s):** eNodeB, MME/SGSN
Requirement 2: Only EIA0
**Reference:** Only EIA0-- CC-OEIA0
**Description:** It shall not be possible to configure just EIA0 on the target
network product. EIA1 and/or EIA2 shall be enabled in compliance to the
specification requirements that demand the use of integrity as mandatory and
the use of EIA0 only for non-authenticated emergency services
**Test case:**
\- Verify that a configuration where only EIA0 is enabled it is not accepted
on the target network product as valid. Verify that it is also needed to
enable at least one of the other types of algorithms that are different from
the \"Null Integrity\".
**Target network product classe(s):** eNodeB, MME/SGSN
Requirement 3: Integrity Algorithms Disabling
**Reference:** Integrity Algorithms Disabling -- CC-IAD
**Description:** Each target network product shall be configured via network
management with lists of algorithms which are allowed for usage. There shall
be one list for integrity algorithms and one for ciphering algorithms. These
lists shall be ordered according to a priority decided by the operator. When a
security context is established for an authenticated user, the target network
product shall choose from its configured list the algorithms which have the
highest priority and that are also supported on the terminal side. (UE EPS
security capabilities). In the case where the target network product is
configured to require the use of only EIA0 (NULL Integrity) as integrity
algorithm the target network product shall not allow the user to connect to
the network even if the user is successful authenticated and EIA0 is the only
integrity algorithm that match in the target network product and terminal
configuration. By allowing the user to connect to the network the mandatory
integrity requirement for signalling protection is not respected. The use of
EIA0 shall be allowed only for unauthenticated emergency calls.
**Test case:**
\- Obtain and verify documentation about integrity algorithms supported on the
target network product.
\- Check that EIA1 and EIA2 are supported as a standard feature.
\- Verify the configuration of the algorithms list on the target network
product
\- Testing the network products behaviour in the case where \"erroneously
\"only EIA0 (NULL Integrity) is enabled on the target network product.
**Target network product classe(s):** eNodeB, MME/SGSN
### A.2.2.8 Network Product Access Control
Network product access control consists of rules restricting the access to the
network product (i.e. user authentication and authorization). In order to
prevent that the Network Product Access feature is exploited, some relevant
security requirements have been identified and described in the following
clauses.
Requirement 1: User Profiling/User Authorization
**Reference:** User Profiling - NAC-UP
Description: Several users with different privileges shall be defined
**Test case:**
\- Verify if different user profiles can be identified for example
administration profile, visualization profile
\- Verify if the different profiles are correctly applied
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 2: No Default Users
**Reference:** No default users - NAC-NDU
**Description:** Default users with default passwords shall not be allowed
**Test case:**
\- Verify if default users are disallowed.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
Requirement 3: No Disable User Authentication
**Reference:** No disable user authentication - NAC-NDUA
**Description:** User authentication cannot be disabled on the target network
product.
**Test case:**
\- Verify user authentication cannot be disabled.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
### A.2.2.9 User Audit of Network Product
Auditing is the practice of inspecting logs for the purpose of verifying that
the system is in a desirable security state or to answer questions about how
the system arrived at a particular state. In order to prevent that the User
Audit of network product feature is exploited, some relevant security
requirements have been identified and described in the following clauses.
Requirement 1: User Activity Audit
**Reference:** User activity accountability for system audit UANP-UACC
**Description:** User undertaking audit of network product activities can get
access to sensitive information. This should be restricted to a certain subset
of users.
**Test case:**
\- Verify user authentication for undertaking network product audit cannot be
disabled and is correctly enforced by the audited product.
**Target network product classe(s):** All
###### ### Annex B: Common criteria overview
# B.1 Target audience of the CC
There are mainly three groups with a general interest in evaluation of the
security properties of Target of Evaluations (TOEs). They are as follows:
a) [Consumers:]{.underline} Consumers can use the results of CC evaluations to
help decide whether a TOE (Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
product) fulfils their security needs. Consumers can also use the evaluation
results to compare different TOEs. The CC gives consumers, especially in
consumer groups and communities of interest, an implementation-independent
structure, termed the Protection Profile (PP), in which to express their
security requirements in an unambiguous manner.
b) [Developers:]{.underline} The CC is intended to support developers in
preparing for and assisting in the evaluation of their TOEs and in identifying
security requirements to be satisfied by those TOEs. These requirements are
contained in an implementation-dependent construct termed the Security Target
(ST). This ST may be based on one or more PPs to show that the ST conforms to
the security requirements from consumers as laid down in those PPs. The CC can
then be used to determine the responsibilities and actions to provide evidence
that is necessary to support the evaluation of the TOE against these
requirements. It also defines the content and presentation of that evidence.
c) [Evaluators:]{.underline} The CC contains criteria to be used by evaluators
when forming judgments about the conformance of TOEs to their security
requirements. The CC describes the set of general actions the evaluator is to
carry out.
d) [Others:]{.underline} Auditors (internal and external), Security architects
and designers, system security officers, etc
# B.2 CC and the ISO/IEC
The CC has been adopted and published by the International Organization for
Standardization/ International Electro-technical Commission (ISO/IEC),
following earlier attempts to integrate information technology and computer
security criteria by various regional SDO\'s.
By the ISO/IEC-developed Standards, the CC is composed of three parts (see
Brief History of the Common Criteria: http://www.niap-ccevs.org/cc_docs/);
these parts or documents are used by the certifying body of a CC scheme and
the evaluation facilities. Brief explanation of each document is given below
a) [ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009: Information technology -- Security techniques --
Evaluation criteria for IT security -- Part 1: Introduction and general
model:]{.underline}\ ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009 establishes the general concepts and
principles of IT security evaluation and specifies the general model of
evaluation given by various parts of ISO/IEC 15408 which in its entirety is
meant to be used as the basis for evaluation of security properties of IT
products.\ It provides an overview of all parts of ISO/IEC 15408. It describes
the various parts of ISO/IEC 15408; defines the terms and abbreviations to be
used in all parts ISO/IEC 15408; establishes the core concept of a Target of
Evaluation (TOE); the evaluation context; and describes the audience to which
the evaluation criteria are addressed. An introduction to the basic security
concepts necessary for evaluation of IT products is given. It defines the
various operations by which the functional and assurance components given in
ISO/IEC 15408-2 and ISO/IEC 15408-3 may be tailored through the use of
permitted operations. The key concepts of protection profiles (PP), packages
of security requirements and the topic of conformance are specified and the
consequences of evaluation and evaluation results are described. ISO/IEC
15408-1:2009 gives guidelines for the specification of Security Targets (ST)
and provides a description of the organization of components throughout the
model. General information about the evaluation methodology is given in
ISO/IEC 18045 and the scope of evaluation schemes is provided.
b) [ISO/IEC 15408-2:2008: Information technology -- Security techniques --
Evaluation criteria for IT security -- Part 2: Security functional
components:]{.underline}\ ISO/IEC 15408-2:2008 defines the content and
presentation of the security functional requirements to be assessed in a
security evaluation using ISO/IEC 15408. It contains a comprehensive catalogue
of predefined security functional components that will meet most common
security needs of the marketplace. These are organized using a hierarchical
structure of classes, families and components, and supported by comprehensive
user notes. ISO/IEC 15408-2:2008 also provides guidance on the specification
of customized security requirements where no suitable predefined security
functional components exist.
c) [ISO/IEC 15408-3:2008: Information technology -- Security techniques --
Evaluation criteria for IT security -- Part 3: Security assurance
components:]{.underline}\ ISO/IEC 15408-3:2008 defines the assurance
requirements of the evaluation criteria. It includes the evaluation assurance
levels that define a scale for measuring assurance for component targets of
evaluation (TOEs), the composed assurance packages that define a scale for
measuring assurance for composed TOEs, the individual assurance components
from which the assurance levels and packages are composed, and the criteria
for evaluation of protection profiles and security targets.\ ISO/IEC
15408-3:2008 defines the content and presentation of the assurance
requirements in the form of assurance classes, families and components and
provides guidance on the organization of new assurance requirements. The
assurance components within the assurance families are presented in a
hierarchical order.
There is also an accompanying document ISO/IEC 18045:2008:
d) [ISO/IEC 18045:2008: Information technology -- Security techniques \--
Methodology for IT security evaluation:\ ]{.underline}ISO/IEC 18045:2008 is a
companion document to ISO/IEC 15408, Information technology - Security
techniques - Evaluation criteria for IT security. ISO/IEC 18045:2008 defines
the minimum actions to be performed by an evaluator in order to conduct an
ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation, using the criteria and evaluation evidence defined
in ISO/IEC 15408. ISO/IEC 18045:2008 does not define evaluator actions for
certain high assurance ISO/IEC 15408 components, where there is as yet no
generally agreed guidance.
# B.3 Common Criteria (Technical) Process overview
{width="5.229166666666667in" height="3.8541666666666665in"}
Figure B.3-1. Overview of the CC Technical Evaluation process [8].
Referring to Figure B.3-1, the Common Criteria approach to the overall
evaluation process is broadly divided into three stages as follows:
[a) The Development Stage]{.underline}
In this stage, the CC defines a set of IT requirements of known validity which
can be used in establishing security requirements for a network product. For a
network product, such requirements can be derived from Third Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) Specifications pertaining to it, such as 3GPP TS
33.401 [8], TS 33.402 [9], TS 23.401 [10], TS 23.402 [11], etc. The CC also
defines the Protection Profile (PP) construct which allows prospective network
product manufacturers (or developers) to create standardized sets of security
requirements for a network product -PP which will meet their needs. The Target
of Evaluation (TOE) (a mobile network product, for our case) is that part of
the product or system which is subject to evaluation. The TOE security
threats, objectives, requirements, and summary specification of security
functions and assurance measures together form the primary inputs to the
Security Target (ST). The PP is transformed into ST and is used by the
evaluators as the basis for evaluation of a network product.
[b) The Evaluation Stage]{.underline}
The principal inputs to evaluation are the Security Target, the set of
evidence about the TOE (a mobile network product, for our case) and the TOE
itself. The expected result of the evaluation process is a confirmation that
the ST is satisfied for the TOE, with one or more reports documenting the
evaluation findings.
The Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) [13] document describes the evaluation
process that consists of the evaluator performing the evaluation input task,
the evaluation output task and the evaluation sub-activities.
[c) The Operation Stage]{.underline}
Once a TOE (mobile network product, for our case) is in operation
vulnerabilities may surface, or environmental assumptions may require
revision. Reports may then be made to the developer requiring changes to the
TOE. Following such changes re-evaluation may be required.
###### ### Annex C: Self-evaluation and Self-evaluation with Third-party
Certification Analysis
As shown in clause 4.5.2 and figure 4.5.2.3-1 copied below, the vendor can
take the Evaluator role and issue a self-declaration; this is what sometimes
referred to as \"self-certification\"\", but for clarity of definitions, this
term is not used in the present document. The Certification Authority role can
be taken by an independent entity, e.g., GSMA, NVIOT or CCRA, which would in
this case be a third-party certification.
{width="6.690277777777778in" height="3.959722222222222in"}
Figure 4.5.3.1-1 Roles involved in the security assurance process.\ The text
\"- OR --\" in the figure indicates that the evaluation report may be
provided\ directly to the operator or that it may be subject to certification
first.
As it can be seen on the diagram above, the self-declaration step corresponds
to giving directly the self-evaluation report from the vendor to the operator.
So the wording \"self-certification\" is a synonym to \"self-evaluation\" plus
self-declaration. As this wording is not used anywhere else in the Security
Assurance world, it is proposed not to use the wording \"self-certification\"
anymore in the TR to avoid confusion.
The following text and table will clarify the differences between \"self-
evaluation\" plus self-declaration (formerly called self-certification) and
self-evaluation with third party certification of the evaluation results.
(1) Should supporting certification be a criterion for evaluation of
methodologies?
Some methodologies can support third-party certification; other methodologies
support only self-evaluation without certification of the results. In order to
select the methodology, supporting certification should be a criterion since
it will impact the methodology selection.
(2) Should self-evaluation be a requirement for all methodologies?
Not all existing methodologies accept self-evaluation. For example, when the
CCRA recognition is needed, the CC framework only supports third-party
evaluation and certification. Thus methodologies that only support third-party
certification will be excluded if self-evaluation is a requirement.
Therefore support of self-evaluation should not be a requirement for
evaluation of the methodologies.
(3) What is the difference between self-evaluation and self-evaluation with
third party certifications?
The analysis of the two approaches considers the following dimensions:
certification authority, time and cost effectiveness, confidence of assurance
level.
NOTE: This analysis is not intended to value self-evaluation based
methodologies or self evaluation + third-party certification based
methodologies but to look at what the trade-off in terms of cost, time and
assurance level is, in case there is a third party certification at the end of
the process or not.
The analysis is as follows:
+----+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+ | NÂ° | Dimension | Self-evaluation | Self-evaluation + | | | | plus | | | | | self-declaration | Third-party | | | | | certification | +----+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+ | 1 | Certification | None | Authorized | | | Authority | | existing | | | | | certification | | | | | authorities (e.g., | | | | | GSMA, NVIOT or | | | | | CCRA | +----+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+ | 2 | Time and cost for | Not applicable | The third-party | | | certification | | certification | | | | | authority needs | | | | | and to be able to | | | | | decide if the | | | | | evaluation report | | | | | gives sufficient | | | | | evidence that a | | | | | proper evaluation | | | | | of the network | | | | | product has been | | | | | conducted. | | | | | | | | | | Cost and time is | | | | | increased due to | | | | | the third-party | | | | | certification, but | | | | | can be fixed as | | | | | the evaluation is | | | | | carried out by the | | | | | vendor. | +----+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+ | 3 | Confidence of | The assurance | High confidence in | | | assurance level | level can be | compliance with | | | | abused. More | the assurance | | | | confidence in the | level. | | | | assurance level | | | | | can be achieved if | | | | | the methodology | | | | | mandates | | | | | accreditation of | | | | | the evaluator in | | | | | order to | | | | | demonstrate they | | | | | have the skills, | | | | | working practices | | | | | and resources to | | | | | conduct the | | | | | evaluation (e.g. | | | | | using | | | | | quality/security | | | | | standard ISO | | | | | 17025, etc.) | | +----+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
It can be seen from the above table that addition of third-party certification
at the end of the process provides a higher confidence of the assurance level
but increases time and cost.
###### ### Annex D: Threat modelling frameworks
# D.1 ITU-T X.805
## D.1.1 Overview
The following presentation given at IETF 63 (2005) provides a good overview of
application of ITU-T X.805 in practice:
http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/63/slides/saag-3/saag-3.ppt
X.805 used the ITU-T X.800 threat model which is an Attacker-centric threat
model considering 5 types of security threats against the network products to
violate the Confidentiality, the Integrity and the Availability (CIA) of data
and services:
\- Destruction: Destruction of information and/or other resources (attack on
availability)
\- Corruption: Corruption or modification of information (attack on integrity)
\- Removal: Theft, removal or loss of information and/or other resources
(attack on availability)
\- Disclosure: Disclosure of information (attack on confidentiality)
\- Interruption: Interruption of services (attack on availability)
It also provides the following 8 security dimensions aiming to address all
possible network product vulnerabilities:
\- Access Control: methods to limit and control access to network elements,
services & applications (e.g. password, ACL, firewall);
\- Authentication: methods to provide Proof of Identity (e.g. shared secret,
PKI, digital signature, digital certificate);
\- Non-repudiation: mechanisms to prevent the ability to deny that an activity
on the network occurred (e.g. system logs, digital signatures);
\- Data Confidentiality: mechanisms to ensure confidentiality of data (e.g.
encryption);
\- Communication Security: methods to ensure information only flows from
source to destination (e.g. VPN, MPLS, L2TP);
\- Data Integrity: methods to ensure data is received as sent or retrieved as
stored (e.g. MD5, digital signature, anti-virus software);
\- Availability: methods to ensure network elements, services and application
available to legitimate users (e.g. IDS/IPS, network redundancy, BC/DR);
\- Privacy: methods to ensure that the identification, the network use is kept
private (e.g. NAT, encryption).

## D.1.2 Security layers and security planes
X.805 also uses the concept of security layers and security planes as key
concepts to further structure the threat assessment.
### D.1.2.1 Security layers
X.805 defines three security different layers as show in figure 2:
Infrastructure, Service and Applications. Each Security Layer has unique
vulnerabilities and threats. The goal of the mapping is determining how the
elements in the upper layer can rely on protection that lower layers provide
(i.e. determine how infrastructure security enables services security and how
this latter, in turn, enables applications security).
{width="5.68125in" height="3.7736111111111112in"}
Figure D.1.2.1-1: Security Layers
A concrete application on of these Security Layers to IP Networks could be the
following:
**Infrastructure Security Layer**
\- Individual routers, servers (3GPP network products)
\- Communication links
**Services Security Layer**
\- Basic IP transport
\- IP support services (e.g., AAA, DNS, DHCP)
\- Value-added services: (e.g., VPN, VoIP, QoS)
**Applications Security Layer**
\- Basic applications (e.g. FTP, web access)
\- Fundamental applications (e.g., email)
\- High-end applications (e.g., e-commerce, e-training)
The applications and services which serve the function of a 3GPP network
product (for example OAM management application of an MME or basic IP
transport for the communication links) are in the scope.
### D.1.2.2 Security planes
_X.805 defines three security planes (Management Security Plane,
Control/Signalling Security Plane and End-User Security Plane) as show in the
figure below:_
{width="6.092361111111111in" height="4.1506944444444445in"}
Figure D.1.1.2-1: Security Planes
The concept of Security Planes is used for ensuring that essential network
activities are protected independently (e.g. compromise of security at the
End-user Security Plane does not affect functions associated with the
Management Security Plane). Moreover, the concept of Security Planes allows to
identify potential network vulnerabilities that may occur when distinct
network activities depend on the same security measures for protection
### D.1.2.3 Combination of layers and planes
In X.805, each Security Plane is applied to every Security Layer. This leads
to nine security perspectives (3x3).
_Table D.1.2.3-1 : Security Perspectives_
* * *
                              Infrastructure Layer     Service Layer            Application Layer
Management Security Plane Security Perspective 1 Security Perspective 4
Security Perspective 7 Control Security Plane Security Perspective 2 Security
Perspective 5 Security Perspective 8 End-User Security Plane Security
Perspective 3 Security Perspective 6 Security Perspective 9
* * *
This approach permits to provide a modular, systematic and organized way for
performing network security assessments and planning.
Each security perspective has unique threat and vulnerabilities and in every
of these perspectives, security objectives can be derived.
Below is an example referring to the Security Perspective 3 reported in Table
D.1.2.3-1.
Table D.1.2.3-2: Example of security objectives for\ Infrastructure Layer /
User Data Plane in the 8 security dimensions of X.805
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Security Dimension | Security Objectives | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Access Control | Ensure that only authorised personnel or | | | devices are allowed access to end-user | | | data that is transiting a network element | | | or communications link or is resident in | | | an offline storage device. | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Authentication | Verify the identity of the person or | | | device attempting to access end-user data | | | that is transiting a network element of | | | communication link or is resident in an | | | offline storage device. | | | | | | Authentication techniques may be required | | | as part of Access Control. | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Non-repudiation | Provide a record identifying each | | | individual or device that accessed | | | end-user data that is transiting a network | | | element or communication link, or is | | | resident in offline devices and that the | | | action was performed. The record is to be | | | used as proof of access to end-user data. | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Data Confidentiality | Protect end-user data that is transiting a | | | network element or communication link, or | | | is resident in an offline storage device | | | against unauthorised access or viewing. | | | Techniques used to address access control | | | may contribute to provide data | | | confidentiality for end-user data. | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Communication Security | Ensure that end-user data that is | | | transiting a network element or | | | communication link is not diverted or | | | intercepted as it flows between the end | | | point (without an authorised access). | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Data Integrity | Protect end-user data that is transiting a | | | network element or communication link or | | | is resident in offline storage devices | | | against unauthorised modification, | | | deletion, creation and reputation. | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Availability | Ensure that access to end-user data | | | resident in offline storage devices by | | | authorised personnel and devices cannot be | | | denied. | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Privacy | Ensure that network elements do not | | | provide information pertaining to the | | | end-user network activities (e.g. Users | | | geographic location, websites visited, | | | content etc.) to unauthorised personnel | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
## D.1.3 Complete picture and conclusions for this approach
In the following figure the complete ITU-T X.805 security architecture is
shown:
{width="6.122916666666667in" height="2.5493055555555557in"}
Figure D.1.3-1: ITU-T X.805 security architecture
This approach is able to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end network view of
security. It can be applied to any network technology (e.g. wireless,
wireline, optical networks) and to a several networks (e.g. service
providers\' networks, data centers\' networks, government\'s networks and so
on). Finally it is aligned with other security ITU-T Recommendations and ISO
standards.
Even if this approach is very complete and ensures coverage of all cross-layer
interactions in the definition of threats, the final concrete usage of it
might be heavy if applied again for all network product classes.
Editor\'s note: Whether the threat analysis could be done per SCAS modules
instead of per network product class in order to ensure modularity and reuse
of what is common to all network product classes is FFS.
Editor\'s note: To which extend X.805 could concretely fit to this approach
per SCAS module is FFS.
## D.2 Threats classifications by looking at the sources of attacks
### D.2.1 Overview
Another way of classifying the threats is to look at the different interfaces
and sources of attacks. The figure below present attacks on an LTE network
categorized by attacks happened in different domain.
{width="6.6875in" height="3.7875in"}
Figure D.2.1-1: threats classification example by attack sources
NOTE 1: The figure is not intended to cover all attack cases and could be
refined.
The figure looks at the threat from a different angle but some correspondences
with ITU-T X.805 can be found. As for the security planes for example:
\- End--user Security Plane \T1.
\- Management Security Plane \ T6, T7, T8
\- Control/Signalling Security planes \ T1, T2, T3, T4, T5
NOTE 2: This mapping is just an example not exhaustive.
The various 8 (T1-T8) threats classifications are intended to deal with the
threats for the different parts of the network as examples. Of course, maybe
it needs further analysis to see if it has covered all of the threats classes.
\- T1 summarizes the threats coming from the terminal, e.g., a malicious or
compromised UE can be used to initiate DoS attack to eNB/MME, detect the
topology of core network, or any other type of attacks.
\- T2 summarizes the threats related to the air interface and communication
path. Attacker can launch attacks on air interface such as, for example,
eavesdropping, modifying and forging the signalling or user data on this
interface.
\- T3 summarizes the threats raised by a physical access to a RAN network
device. For example this type of attack can target eNB network product class a
console interface access violation.
\- T4 summarizes the threats identified for the transport network. If the
backhaul link is exposed without physical protection, an attacker who can
access the backhaul link could eavesdrop or modify the messages transported in
the link.
\- T5 summarizes the threats coming from other external interconnected
networks (e.g. GRX/IPX, other PLMNs and so on) and targeting for example
MME/S-GW/P-GW. For example, an operator A, in order to provide roaming service
to end users, has to establish connections with external mobile operator
networks. So the operator A\'s MME/S-GW/P-GW has to be accessed by external
mobile operator\'s network products.\ If a network product in an external
mobile operator network is compromised, it can be used to attack to the
operator A\'s network.
\- T6 refers to threat coming from the internal networks, mostly for the
charging. Insider attacker like disgruntled employee from operator could also
try to attack charging system through MME/S-GW/P-GW.
\- T7 summarizes the threats for the OAM side similar to T6. Disgruntled
employee will try to attack MME/S-GW/P-GW through management plane by remote
management application or by physical interface.
\- T8 summarizes the threats coming from Internet or another connected packet
data network (PDN), e.g. a corporate/partner IP network. The attacks coming
from these PDNs could violate the border security protections (e.g. FW) to
inject virus, worms, Trojan-horses into core network or make some other types
of attacks.
###### ### Annex E: Vendor network product development and network product
lifecycle management process assurance requirements
# E.1 Example of requirements from CPA Build Standard
These requirements are taken from the CPA Build Standard [18] at Foundation
Grade Evaluation Level with wording adaptation to fit in SECAM vocabulary. The
\"Test cases\" are given for information in order to better describe the
requirement and are short version of the \"Assurance Activities\" from the CPA
Build Standard [18]. To have more details on the test case and approximate
correspondence to the equivalent CC components, the reader is invited to read
[18]. Annex E.2 will provide a mapping of these 13 requirements into the 4
blocks of requirements from 5.2.4.1.\ Below, the requirements that would map
to the \"Flaw remediation\" bloc are given as examples.
2\. Updates that fix security flaws must be actively advertised to supported
customers and categorised according to the severity of the flaw.
\- Test case: The Accreditor must examine the Product Vendor\'s processes for
informing customers of security issues discovered in their product, and ensure
that these will ensure an effective and timely distribution of information.
5\. The Vendor must use defined processes for flaw remediation, and show that
Vendors are trained in these processes. The Vendor must also show that
mechanisms are in place to ensure that this process cannot be bypassed by the
Vendor.
\- Test case: The Accreditor must investigate the Vendor\'s flaw remediation
processes, and ensure that they are applicable to any realistic problems
9\. Flaw remediation is performed in practice.
\- Test case: The Accreditor must seek evidence that the Vendor\'s flaw
remediation procedures are routinely followed in practice. The Vendor must
also be able show to the Accreditor how a random sample of issues discovered
(from minor to major) at all points in the product\'s lifecycle have been
managed from discovery, through analysis, correction, testing and ultimate
resolution.
12\. Externally reported flaws in the Vendor\'s products must be handled
appropriately
\- Test case: The Accreditor must seek evidence that the Vendor has a process
for receiving externally discovered flaws that are reported. This process must
be routinely followed in practice.
