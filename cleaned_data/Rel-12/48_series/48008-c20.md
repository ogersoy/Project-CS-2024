# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the layer 3 procedures used on the Base Station
System (BSS) to Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC) interface for control
of GSM services.
For the purposes of call control and mobility management, messages are not
interpreted at the Base Station System (BSS) which acts as a relay function.
These messages and procedures are documented in 3GPP TS 24.008, the only
relevant issues covering these messages in the present document are those
concerned with error conditions at the interface, and the headers that are
required for the correct addressing of the messages. This is specified in more
detail in 3GPP TS 48.002.
The functional split between MSC and BSS is defined in 3GPP TS 48.002 and
states that the BSS is responsible for local radio resource allocation and in
order to support this the required procedures between BSS and MSC are defined
in detail in the present document.
3GPP TS 48.002 also states that the BSS is responsible for the scheduling of
all CCCH/BCCH messages and therefore some procedures for providing the BSS
with the necessary information to be passed on these channels for individual
calls (i.e. paging) are defined in the present document, but the scheduling is
not discussed.
This interface and consequently these layer 3 procedures are designed to
support BSSs providing one or more cells.

## 1.2 Definitions and Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the definitions and abbreviations
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905.
\- **Network sharing:** network sharing is an optional feature that allows
different core network operators to connect to the same shared radio access
network (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [52]). When network sharing is in use within a
given cell, the network broadcasts within system information the PLMN
identities of the PLMNs sharing the cell. A mobile station supporting network
sharing uses this information for its PLMN (re)selection processes and
indicates the selected PLMN to the BSS.

# 2 Application to interface structures
The underlying transport mechanism defined to carry signalling information
between the BSS and the MSC is the Message Transfer Part (MTP), and the
Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of Signalling System No.7.
The MTP and SCCP are used to support communication between the MSC and two
conceptual entities within the BSS, these are:
\- the BSS Operation and Maintenance Application Part (BSSOMAP);
\- the BSS Application Part (BSSAP).
The BSS Application Part is split into two sub application parts, these are:
\- the BSS Management Application Part (BSSMAP);
\- the Direct Transfer Application Part (DTAP).
Distribution of messages between the two sub application parts is described in
3GPP TS 48.002.
Figure 1 is a diagrammatical representation of these conceptual entities. It
should be noted that this is not intended to imply a particular implementation
and is only for the purposes of specifying the interface.
Differentiation between BSSAP and BSSOMAP is by addressing mechanisms within
the SCCP, using the subsystem number (see 3GPP TS 48.002).
## 2.1 The BSS Operation and Maintenance Application Part
If operation and maintenance messages are transferred by means of this
interface then they shall use SCCP messages. The application protocol for the
Operation and Maintenance Application Part is defined in the 3GPP TS 52 series
Technical Specifications. The routeing and addressing is provided by the SCCP
and allows the MSC and the O&M centre to be addressed directly by the BSS
using, for example, two E.164 numbers. The operator may also use an X.25
connection for the transfer of O&M messages between the BSS and the OMC. This
option is not further discussed in the present document.
## 2.2 The Direct Transfer Application Part
The Direct Transfer Application Part (DTAP) is used to transfer call control
and mobility management messages between the MSC and the MS. The DTAP
information in these messages is not interpreted by the BSS. 3GPP TS 48.002
contains more detail relating to the handling of DTAP messages at the BSS, the
multiplexing of the messages onto the relevant signalling channels of the
radio interface, and the use of the SCCP services.
Messages received from the MS are identified as DTAP by the Protocol
Discriminator Information Element as described in 3GPP TS 24.008, except for
Initial Layer 3 messages (see sub-clause 3.1.16). The majority of radio
interface messages are transferred across the BSS MSC interface by the DTAP,
the exceptions being messages belonging to the Radio Resource (RR) management
protocol.
## 2.3 The BSS Management Application Part
The BSSMAP supports all of the procedures between the MSC and the BSS that
require interpretation and processing of information related to single calls,
and resource management.
Some of the BSSMAP procedures result in, or are triggered by, Radio Resource
(RR) management messages defined in 3GPP TS 24.008. The BSSMAP procedures are
described in sub-clause 3.
## 2.4 Handling of abnormal events related to the BSSAP Header
The BSSAP header is specified in 3GPP TS 48.002. Several abnormal events may
be detected by the receiver:
\- use of a reserved value in the DLCI or discriminator;
\- length octet with value zero;
\- length octet with a value inconsistent with that indicated by the SCCP.
In these cases the receiver may send a BSSMAP CONFUSION message as specified
in sub-clause 3.2.1. If so, depending on the error in the BSSAP header, the
error pointer shall be set to one of the values reserved for the BSSAP header
in sub-clause 3.2.2.32.
Spare bits in the BSSAP header shall not be checked by the receiving entity.
# 3 The BSS Management Application Part
## 3.1 BSSMAP Procedures
This sub-clause describes the procedures used in the BSS Management
Application Part. There are the following main procedures:
* * *
* Assignment figure 2 # Blocking figures 10 and 25 # Resource indication figure 12 # Reset figure 11 * Handover required indication figure 4 * Handover resource allocation figure 5 * Handover execution figure 3 # Handover candidate enquiry figure 13 * Release figures 6 and 7 # Paging figure 15 # Flow control figure 14 * Classmark update figure 9 * Cipher mode control figure 17 * Trace invocation   
* Initial MS message   
* Queuing indication   
* Data link control SAPI not   
equal to 0 figure 18 # Reset circuit  
* PDSS1 flow control   
* Circuit re-selection figure 26 * Location Aquisition   
# Connectionless Information Transfer  
* Common ID   
# Reset IP Resource
* * *
These procedures are documented separately and are intended to be used by the
operators/manufacturers to build up complete call sequences, in a flexible
manner. Any sequences given where more than one procedure is shown
concatenated are only for illustrative purposes.
Each of the above procedures is qualified by either an asterisk (*) or a hash
symbol (#). The hash symbol (#) denotes a global procedure which concerns a
complete cell or BSS, or specific terrestrial circuits. The asterisk symbol
(*) denotes a dedicated procedure which concerns a single dedicated radio
resource on the radio interface, or in the case of a multislot configuration,
all radio resources allocated to one mobile station.
Messages used to support global procedures are sent using the connectionless
services of the SCCP.
Messages used to support dedicated procedures are sent using the connection
oriented services of the SCCP, on the connection which has been set up to
support that call or transaction. The establishment of SCCP connections is
detailed in 3GPP TS 48.002.
In the following description of each procedure it is explicitly stated whether
the procedure is global or not, and hence the type of SCCP service used to
support the procedure is defined.
The handling of unknown terrestrial circuits is defined in sub-clause 3.1.19.6
and the procedures of sub-clause 3.1.19.6 take precedence over those of the
rest of sub-clause 3.1. The procedures of the rest of sub-clause 3.1 assume
that the terrestrial circuit is known by the entity concerned.
### 3.1.1 Assignment
The purpose of the assignment procedure is to ensure that the correct
dedicated radio resource(s) can be allocated or reallocated to a MS that
requires it. However, the initial random access by the MS and \"Immediate
Assignment\" to a DCCH is handled autonomously by the BSS without reference to
the MSC.
#### 3.1.1.1 Successful Operation
The initial conditions are assumed to be that the MS is in contact with the
fixed infrastructure of a PLMN by means of one or more dedicated radio
resources (and possibly a terrestrial resource) and that the MSC has analysed
any relevant call control information and wishes to allocate or reallocate to
the MS one or more radio resources (and possibly a terrestrial resource).
The MSC is the entity that carries out the necessary analysis on the call
control information received from the MS or fixed network customer. If an IP
based user plane interface is supported, the Codec List (BSS supported) shall
be taken into account, considering the Codec capabilities of the core network,
aiming for true end-to-end Codec negotiation and for common supported
Codec(s).
If an IP based user plane interface is supported, then the MSC shall consider
the CSData Codec Type within the Codec List (BSS supported) for data and fax
calls. The purpose of the CSData Codec Type negotiation is to determine the
A-Interface Type (TDM or IP) and the Redundancy Level (option only for IP).
The Redundancy Level affects only the A-Interface IP link and not the air
interface. For data and fax call, there is no end-to-end negotiation of this
CSData Codec Type. The Codec negotiation just happens between the BSS and the
MSC.
On the basis of this analysis a resource request is made to the appropriate
BSS by sending it an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message. This message contains details
of the resource(s) required (for instance channel rate, channel type, data
adaptation, priority level etc.). If the requested resource(s) is/are for
speech or data it also may indicate the terrestrial resource that shall be
used between the MSC and BSS. The description of the resource(s) can either be
a complete specification, or give the BSS some freedom in the selection (for
instance channel rate selection, speech version, Codec Type and Codec
Configuration selection, Interface Type selection, Redundancy Level selection,
etc.). If an IP based user plane interface is supported, the Codec List (MSC
Preferred), see subclause 3.2.2.103, shall be included in the ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message. The ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message may also contain CLASSMARK
information in case such information is available in the MSC, but assumed not
to be available in the BSS. A full description of the message is given in sub-
clause 3.2.1.1.
In this specification a \"pool\" is a group of circuits supporting the same
channel types.
The ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is sent via the BSSMAP and is analysed within
the BSS. Based on this analysis, which is not defined further in the present
document, the BSS chooses the appropriate radio resource(s) and allocates the
appropriate resources for transcoding, rate adaptation etc. On the terrestrial
route connecting the BSS and MSC, certain circuits can be used for different
combinations of bearer capabilities. This can be modelled by grouping the
circuits into \"pools\" supporting the same channel types. The MSC holds this
information as route data. If the MSC allocates an A interface circuit, it
should only ever ask for resources from the BSS that it knows are not totally
incompatible with the nominated circuit. The BSS will construct and send the
appropriate radio assignment messages, if required (i.e. if the radio
resource(s) has/have to be changed), as described in 3GPP TS 44.018 and start
timer T10. The ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message includes sufficient information to
allow the BSS to construct the necessary layer 3 radio messages. If the BSS
allocates the A interface circuits, and such a circuit is needed, the BSS
shall allocate a circuit.
In the case where several circuit pools (groups of circuits supporting the
same channel types) are available on the BSS MSC interface, the terrestrial
circuit allocated by the MSC, if any, is chosen taking into account the
circuit pool the circuit belongs to and the required channel type.
The management of priority levels is implementation dependent, under operator
control.
If queuing is managed, new requests which cannot be served immediately are put
in the queuing file according to the indicated priority levels.
The priority levels and the preemption indicators may (singularly or in
combination) be used to determine whether the assignment has to be performed
unconditionally and immediately. This would lead to triggering of the
preemption procedure which may then cause the forced release or forced
handover of a lower priority connection if no free resource is immediately
available.
Whilst the process and the extent of the preemption procedure is operator
dependent, the preemption indicators (refer to sub-clause 3.2.2.18.), if given
in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST, shall be treated on a per connection basis as
follows:
\- The last received \"Preemption Vulnerability indicator\" and priority
levels shall prevail.
\- If the \"Preemption Capability indicator\" bit is set to 1, then this
allocation request can trigger the running of the preemption procedure.
\- If the \"Preemption Capability indicator\" bit is set to 0, then this
allocation request cannot trigger the preemption procedure.
\- If the \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 1, then this connection
is vulnerable and shall be included in the preemption process or procedure and
as such may be subject to forced release or forced handover.
\- If the \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 0, then this connection
is not vulnerable to preemption and shall not be included in the preemption
process and as such may not be subject to forced release or forced handover.
\- If no priority Information Element has been received, both \"Preemption
Capability\" and \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bits shall be regarded as set to
0.
The BSS shall ignore the classmark information included in the ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message if such information has already been received from the MS.
The radio assignment procedure on the radio path is described in 3GPP TS
44.018. When the BSS is satisfied that the radio assignment procedure has been
successfully accomplished (e.g. by receipt of a radio interface ASSIGNMENT
COMPLETE message) it will stop timer T10 and return an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE
message over the BSS MSC interface. This will implicitly release the old
dedicated radio resource(s) at the BSS. If an intra-BSS cell change has
occurred during the assignment, the new cell identity is included in the
ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message and a HANDOVER PERFORMED message is not required.
If the MSC gave the BSS some freedom in resource type selection, the choices
made by the BSS are indicated in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message. If an IP
based user plane interface is supported, the \"Speech Codec (Chosen)\" shall
be included in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message. If the BSS has to allocate a
circuit or an IP based user plane connection, the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message
includes the identity of the circuit or the local IP endpoint included in the
\"AoIP Transport Layer Address\" allocated by the BSS.
If an IP based user plane interface is supported, the BSC should
preferentially accept the preferred codec proposed by the MSC; the selection
of an alternative codec may entail transcoding in the Network.
When several circuit pools are present on the BSS MSC interface, and when the
circuit is allocated by the MSC, the \"circuit pool\" information element
shall be included in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE. The \"circuit pool\" field will
indicate to the MSC the circuit pool of the CIC given in the ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message.
If the assignment did not require a change of radio resource(s), and
consequently no 3GPP TS 44.018 radio assignment procedure had been invoked,
then the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message shall be returned to the MSC as soon as
the requested resources have been allocated within the BSS.
If the assignment requires a change of terrestrial circuit or in the case of
assignment for signalling the release of a previously used terrestrial
circuit, the change or release shall be performed before the ASSIGNMENT
COMPLETE message is sent and the BSS shall consider that the old terrestrial
circuit is idle.
After the completion of the assignment procedure, until the connection is
released or the MSC performs a new assignment, any dedicated resource assigned
to the mobile station, e.g. at internal handover, must be in accordance with
the description in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
If the MS is a talker or listener in a voice group call, the MSC shall inform
the BSS to which voice group call the MS belongs to and whether the MS is a
talker or a listener. The BSS may then decide to allocate and assign dedicated
channel or move the MS to a voice group call channel relating to the group
call reference. If the BSS moves the MS to a voice group call channel it will
send the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message and then immediately afterwards send a
CLEAR REQUEST cause \"Joined group call channel\". If the assignment procedure
is used to transfer the talker from a group call channel to a dedicated
channel and the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message contains a Group Call Reference IE
with group key number other than \'no ciphering\', the MSC shall provide the
BSS with the permitted ciphering algorithms and the ciphering key to use in
case the BSS assigns a dedicated channel.
In the case where localised service area is supported the MSC may inform the
BSS as to which LSA identities that the mobile has preferences by sending the
LSA INFORMATION message. The BSS stores this information and uses it when
determining the target cell list for handover. The algorithm for determining
the target cell list for handover is not defined further in the present
document. The reception of another message containing LSA identities for the
connection will replace the LSA identities previously received. The BSS, in
the case where localised service area is supported, will indicate the LSA
identity of the serving cell in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE if it corresponds to
one of the LSA identities received in the latest LSA INFORMATION or the
HANDOVER REQUEST messages.
In the case where Intersystem handover to other RAT\'s is supported, the MSC
may inform the BSS, if preference for other radio access technologies (Service
based handover) shall be applied to the MS connection. In such cases the MSC
sets the Service Handover Information Element accordingly in the ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message. The Service Handover information is stored in the BSS
throughout the connection and is used in the Handover evaluation process.
If the Service Handover information element indicates that \"handover to UTRAN
or cdma2000 should be performed\", the BSS should perform an Intersystem
handover via directed retry instead of the assignment. If this is not
possible, the BSS shall proceed with the assignment procedure as specified
above.
NOTE 1: If, due to limitations of the mobile station or the network it is
attached to, the service requested by the subscriber cannot be provided in
GSM, but by another RAT, then the MSC may include in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message a Service Handover information element indicating that \"handover to
UTRAN or cdma2000 should be performed\" and the required channel type coded
according to NOTE 4 in subclause 3.2.2.11. The MSC may under these
circumstances omit allocating a terrestrial circuit. In such a case, if the
BSC cannot initiate a directed retry, the assignment will fail.
If local switching is requested by the core network, the MSC includes the
Global Call Reference IE, LCLS-Configuration IE, and optionally the LCLS-
Connection-Status-Control IE and the LCLS-Correlation-Not-Needed IE in the
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
If the BSS supports Local Call Local Switch (LCLS) and receives the ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message containing the Global Call Reference IE and the LCLS-
Configuration IE, then the BSS shall store the Global Call Reference (GCR)
value (or replace the previously stored GCR value) and check if the requested
LCLS configuration included in the LCLS-Configuration IE is supported.
\- If the requested LCLS configuration is not supported, then the BSS shall
indicate this to the MSC in the LCLS-BSS-Status IE included in the ASSIGNMENT
COMPLETE message, see sub-clause 3.1.33.2.3.
\- If the BSS supports the requested LCLS configuration, then the BSS shall
perform call leg correlation as described in sub-clause 3.1.33.2.1 and report
the outcome to the MSC in LCLS-BSS-Status IE included in the ASSIGNMENT
COMPLETE message.
If BSS determines that the call is an intra-BSS call and therefore can be
locally switched it shall not through-connect the two parties unless
explicitly indicated to do so in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message by receiving
the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to \"Connect\" on both call legs.
NOTE 2: If not included in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the LCLS-
Connection-Status-Control IE may be received in the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL
message after completion of the assignment procedure.
The BSS shall inform the MSC of the local switch establishment outcome by
including the LCLS-BSS-Status IE with the correct **LCLS connection status**
value according to sub-clause 3.2.2.119 in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message.
The BSS shall also notify the MSC serving the other call leg if the **LCLS
connection status** is changed for this call leg, see sub-clause 3.1.33.5.
NOTE 3: If the BSS does not support LCLS then the Global Call Reference IE and
the LCLS-Configuration IE in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message will be ignored by
the BSS and no LCLS-BSS-Status IE will be returned in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE
message.
If the MSC determines that CS to PS SRVCC is allowed for this particular
connection, the MSC includes the CS to PS SRVCC IE in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message.
Upon reception of an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message including the CS to PS SRVCC
IE, the BSS may trigger the CS to PS SRVCC procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018)
according to the reported capabilities of the MS.
#### 3.1.1.2 Assignment Failure
The following failure conditions may occur:
The BSS may not be able to use the terrestrial resource that the MSC has
indicated in which case an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message will be returned to the
MSC with the cause set to \"requested terrestrial resource unavailable\".
The BSS may not be able to support any of the permitted ciphering algorithms.
In this case a ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message shall be returned to the MSC with
the failure cause set to \"ciphering algorithm not supported\".
If the requested channel type or resource (e.g. channel rate, speech version,
Codec Type or Codec Configuration, Redundancy Level, A-Interface Type, etc.)
indicated in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is not temporarily available (e.g.
due to overload) or not supported in the BSS, then an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE
message shall be returned to the MSC. The appropriate failure cause will be
included in the message (Cause value: \"requested transcoding/rate adaptation
unavailable\" or \"requested speech version unavailable\" or \"Requested Codec
Type or Codec Configuration unavailable\" or \"Requested Redundancy Level not
supported\" or "Requested Redundancy Level not available or \"Requested Codec
Type or Codec Configuration not supported\" or \"Requested A-Interface Type
unavailable\" or \"Requested A-Interface Type not supported\").
If the MSC requested an IP-bearer for the A-Interface by providing the AoIP
Transport Layer Address and not providing a Circuit Identity Code, but the BSS
is not able to use an IP-bearer, then the BSS shall not allocate a Circuit
Identity Code on its own, even if the Codec List (MSC Preferred) included a
Codec Type with the PT bit set to \"1\", but shall return an ASSIGNMENT
FAILURE message to the MSC with the Cause value \"Requested A-Interface Type
unavailable\".
If, on reception by the BSS of an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message allocating a
circuit, the circuit pool implied by the CIC information element is
incompatible with the channel type indicated (that is, the pool does not
support any of the radio resources indicated by the channel type) an
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE shall be returned to the MSC with the failure cause set to
\"circuit pool mismatch\".
If, on reception by the BSS of an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message modifying an
already allocated circuit, the circuit pool implied by the CIC information
element is incompatible with the channel type indicated (that is, the pool
does not support any of the radio resources indicated by the channel type) the
BSS shall return to the MSC either :
\- an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with the failure cause set to \"circuit pool
mismatch\", or
\- an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message with the failure cause \"directed retry\"
before sending a HANDOVER REQUIRED message with the cause \"switch circuit
pool\" and the \"circuit pool list\" information element . The \"circuit pool
list\" information element will allow the BSS to indicate to the MSC from
which circuit pool or pools the new CIC should be chosen, or
\- a HANDOVER REQUIRED message with the cause \"switch circuit pool\" and the
\"circuit pool list\" information element . The \"circuit pool list\"
information element will allow the BSS to indicate to the MSC from which
circuit pool or pools the new CIC should be chosen.
If, on reception by the BSS of an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message allocating a
circuit, the circuit pool implied by the CIC is compatible with the channel
type indicated (that is, the pool supports at least one of the radio resource
types indicated by the channel type), but the BSS still wishes to change the
circuit pool, it sends an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE with the cause \"switch circuit
pool\" and the \"circuit pool list\" information element.
The \"circuit pool\" information element, when present in the ASSIGNMENT
FAILURE, indicates to the MSC which circuit pool the CIC indicated in the
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST belongs to. This can be used by the MSC to correct its
tables (CIC/circuit pool). The \"circuit pool list\" information element, when
present in the ASSIGNMENT FAILURE, is used when the BSS wishes to indicate to
the MSC its preferred circuit pools. The circuit pools in the \"circuit pool
list\" information element shall be given in order of preference. In the case
of an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE with the cause \"circuit pool mismatch\", the MSC may
decide to block the circuit and to send an O & M notification.
The BSS may not receive a radio interface ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message from the
MS in which case the timer T10 will expire. In this case an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE
message is returned to the MSC and the assignment procedure is terminated
(cause value: radio interface message failure).
If the cell for which the assignment is intended is congested or in case of a
Service Handover indication received from the MSC, the BSS may indicate an
impending directed retry attempt by sending ASSIGNMENT FAILURE (Cause value:
directed retry).
If the radio channel assignment fails for any other reason then an ASSIGNMENT
FAILURE message will be returned to the MSC, the procedure will terminate, and
the associated references concerning the old dedicated resource(s) should be
maintained until explicitly released by the MSC. It should be noted that if
the MS fails to assign after receiving a radio interface ASSIGNMENT COMMAND
and returns to the old channels as detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008, then the radio
interface ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message received from the MS will cause an
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message to be returned to the MSC (cause value: \"Radio
interface failure, reversion to old channel\").
If the BSS has received LSA INFORMATION or HANDOVER REQUEST message indicating
LSA only access and all available radio resources are outside the allowed
LSAs, assignment may fail and ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message may be sent to the
MSC (cause value: \"LSA not allowed\").
If all available radio resources are defined for exclusive access and the
connection is not allowed to access these resources, assignment may fail and
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message may be sent to the MSC (cause value: \"LSA not
allowed\").
Other possible Cause values which may be returned with the ASSIGNMENT FAILURE
message are: \"equipment failure\", \"no radio resource available\", \"O&M
intervention\". If an unrecognised cause value is received, the Class of the
cause value should be used to determine the MSC\'s action.
In the case where the MSC has attempted to assign a terrestrial circuit and an
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message has been returned then both the MSC and the BSS
shall consider that the terrestrial circuit is idle (except as described below
in sub-clause 3.1.1.3) and therefore no explicit clearing sequence is needed.
The MSC may not be able to use the terrestrial resource that the BSS has
indicated. In this case, the procedure is nevertheless considered terminated
successfully, and it is up to the MSC to correct the situation, e.g. by a
circuit re‑selection procedure (not relevant for an IP based user plane
interface).
All messages concerned with an assignment are sent using the connection
oriented mode of the SCCP.
#### 3.1.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the BSS receives an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message calling up a terrestrial
circuit for the user plane interface that is already assigned to another call
then an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message will be returned with a Cause value of:
\"terrestrial circuit already allocated\" and no action will be taken on the
radio interface.
If the BSS receives an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message allocating a terrestrial
circuit which has been blocked by a global block message, then an ASSIGNMENT
FAILURE message shall be sent (Cause value: \"requested terrestrial resource
unavailable\"). A single global BLOCK message (not repeated and not guarded by
timer T1) shall be sent for that concerned terrestrial circuit.
If an external handover becomes necessary during an assignment, for reasons of
radio conditions, congestion or following the reception of a Service Handover
indication from the MSC, the BSS may initiate the handover (directed retry)
whilst the assignment is in progress. In this situation, if a HANDOVER COMMAND
is received by the BSS, it must not be ignored.
### 3.1.2 Blocking and Unblocking
The Blocking and Unblocking procedures are not applied for an IP based user
plane interface.
As described in sub-clause 3.1.1 the assignment procedure depends upon one
side, the MSC or the BSS, choosing the terrestrial resource to be used. If the
entity on one side puts out of service any terrestrial circuit, it needs to
inform the peer entity on the other side of the interface. This is performed
by using a simple blocking/unblocking procedure. The block messages used to
support this procedure are sent as global messages (i.e. using the SCCP
connectionless mode). Each message refers to one or more terrestrial circuits
accessed through the BSS MSC interface. The circuit is identified by its
Circuit Identity Code.
The support of blocking/unblocking procedures is dependent on which side
allocates the circuits.
A circuit is said to be \"locally blocked\" on a given side if it has been put
out of service for a local reason, and to be \"remotely blocked\" if a BLOCK
message about this circuit has been received from the peer entity.
#### 3.1.2.1 Successful Operation
The procedure operates as follows:
Initial conditions are assumed to be that all circuits are remotely unblocked.
An entity may locally block a terrestrial circuit because:
\- Operation and Maintenance intervention makes the circuit unavailable for
use (Cause value: \"O and M intervention\").
\- An equipment failure makes the circuit unavailable (Cause value:
\"equipment failure\").
\- Radio resource is not accessible from the terrestrial circuit (Cause value:
\"no radio resource available\").
When and if the party that does not allocate the circuits (the Circuit Slave)
decides to locally block a terrestrial circuit, it shall immediately mark that
terrestrial circuit as \"blocked\" (to stop any future allocation of that
terrestrial circuit) and shall then send a block message to the peer entity
allocating the circuits (the Circuit Master) and start timer T1 (T20, T21,
T22).
The BLOCK message contains the Circuit Identity Code indicating the
terrestrial circuit that is to be remotely blocked and a Cause Information
Element indicating the reason for blocking. Typical Cause values are: \"no
radio resources available\", \"O and M intervention\", \"equipment failure\".
A BLOCK message in the MSC to BSS direction may also contain an indication
that the connection using the circuit, if any, must be released; in such a
case the circuit master shall check if the circuit is in use and shall release
the connection(s) that use it.
NOTE: This allows the MSC to simultaneously block the circuit and to release
the connection(s) using the circuit, if any, and then to prevent use of the
circuit by the BSS between connection(s) release and blocking.
If the CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK message is applied by the circuit slave the
circuits to be remotely blocked are indicated in the status field of the
Circuit Identity Code List (sub-clause 3.2.2.31).
Receipt of a block message (BLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK) at the circuit
master from the circuit slave will indicate to the circuit master that the
identified circuits are unavailable for reselection. If a call is in progress
on any of the identified terrestrial circuits then it will be unaffected by
this procedure unless explicitly requested, the circuits will however be
\"camp on blocked\". Such circuits shall be remotely blocked as soon as that
call is no longer in progress, or active.
On receipt of a BLOCK message asking for the release of the connection(s)
using the circuit if any, and if the BSS detects that there exists a
connection using the indicated circuit, the BSS shall attempt to release the
connection(s), e.g., by sending a CLEAR REQUEST message on each of the
corresponding SCCP connections. As specified in sub-clause 3.1.17, if the SCCP
connection has been lost, the BSS will detect it when attempting to release
the connection and the whole connection is released as a consequence.
An appropriate blocking acknowledge message (BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE or CIRCUIT
GROUP BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE) will be returned to the circuit slave by the
circuit master to acknowledge receipt of the block message and to indicate
that any necessary action has been taken.
The CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message is accepted as the
appropriate acknowledgement only if the indicated Circuit Identity Code and
the returned Range field of the Circuit Identity Code List match the
corresponding parameter values of the respective initiating message. Otherwise
the message is considered as not expected.
On receipt of the blocking acknowledge the circuit slave shall stop timer T1
(T20, T21, T22).
The resource involved will be assumed to be remotely blocked by the circuit
master until either an unblock (UNBLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCK) or RESET
message is received relevant to that resource.
If the circuit slave wishes to unblock a blocked circuit and return it to
service then it shall immediately mark the circuit as \"locally unblocked\"
and then send an unblock message, and start timer T1 (T20, T21, T22).
If an unblock message (UNBLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCK) is received at the
circuit master for a blocked resource then the resource will be marked as not
remotely blocked and an unblocking acknowledge message (UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE
or CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE) will be returned to the circuit
slave. The circuit slave shall stop timer T1 (T20, T21, T22) on receipt of
this unblocking acknowledge.
The CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message is accepted as the
appropriate acknowledgement only if the indicated Circuit Identity Code and
the returned Range field of the Circuit Identity Code List match the
corresponding parameter values of the respective initiating message. Otherwise
the message is considered as not expected.
Figure 10 shows an overview of the blocking procedure in the case the circuit
slave is the BSS.
NOTE: Timer T1 is used to supervise a single circuit block/unblock procedure
on the BSS side, whilst T20 is used to supervise the circuit group
block/unblock procedure on the BSS side, timer T21 is used to supervise a
single circuit block/unblock procedure on the MSC side, and T22 is used to
supervise the circuit group block/unblock procedure on the MSC side.
#### 3.1.2.2 Abnormal Conditions
If a blocking acknowledge message is not received for a block message within
T1 (T20, T21, T22) seconds then the block message will be repeated. If this
occurs a second time the circuits will be kept marked as locally blocked, and
the situation must then be resolved internally within the circuit slave or by
O&M procedures.
If an unblocking acknowledge message is not received for an unblock message
before expiry of timer T1(T20, T21, T22) then the unblock message will be
repeated. If this occurs a second time, this situation may be reflected to the
O&M, which shall resolve the possible conflict. The unblock message is
repeated at most one time. Whatever the outcome of possible repetitions, the
concerned circuits remain locally \"unblocked\".
If the MSC allocates the circuits, and an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST or HANDOVER
REQUEST message is received by the BSS allocating a circuit which is marked at
the BSS as blocked then an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message or a HANDOVER FAILURE
message (respectively) followed by a BLOCK message shall be sent to the MSC.
If the BSS allocates the circuits, and an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE, HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE or CHANGE CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE message is received by the
MSC allocating a circuit which is marked at the MSC as blocked, it is up to
the MSC how to correct the situation, e.g., by performing a circuit re-
selection procedure and sending a BLOCK message.
##### 3.1.2.2.1 Applying to the Single Circuit Block Procedure
i) If a BLOCK message is received for a circuit already remotely blocked, a
BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message will be sent.
ii) If an UNBLOCK message is received for a remotely unblocked circuit, an
UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message will be sent.
iii) If a BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message, which is not expected as an
acknowledgement for a BLOCK message, is received:
a) Relating to a circuit which is locally blocked, the BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE
message is discarded.
b) Relating to a circuit, which is not locally blocked, then an UNBLOCK
message will be sent.
iv) If an UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message, which is not expected as an
acknowledgement for an UNBLOCK message, is received:
a) Relating to a circuit which is not locally blocked, the received UNBLOCKING
ACKNOWLEDGE message is discarded.
b) Relating to a circuit, which is locally blocked, then a BLOCK message will
be sent.
##### 3.1.2.2.2 Applying to the Circuit Group Block Procedure
v) If a CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK message is received relating to remotely blocked
circuits then blocking acknowledgement indications for those circuits are
given in the status field of the corresponding CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCKING
ACKNOWLEDGE message which will be sent in response.
vi) If a CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCK message is received relating to circuits which
are not remotely blocked then unblocking acknowledgement indications for those
circuits are given in the status field of the corresponding CIRCUIT GROUP
UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message which will be sent in response.
vii) When the circuit master upon receipt of a CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK (UNBLOCK)
message is not able to give an appropriate blocking (unblocking)
acknowledgement indication for each Circuit Identification Code (e.g. because
that/those Circuit Identification Code(s) is (are) not allocated to any
circuit at the receiving entity) for which a block (unblock) indication is
given in the status field of the received CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK (UNBLOCK)
message, then no blocking (unblocking) acknowledgement relating to that/those
Circuit Identification Code(s) will be given in the status field of the
corresponding CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCKING (UNBLOCKING) ACKNOWLEDGE message which
will be sent in response.
viii) If a CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message in response to a CIRCUIT
GROUP BLOCK message is received by the circuit slave containing in the status
field no blocking acknowledgement for circuits which are to be blocked due to
the previously sent CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK message, then the CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK
message will be repeated for the circuit(s) concerned.
If this occurs a second time the concerned circuit(s) will be kept marked as
locally blocked, and the situation must then be resolved internally within the
circuit slave or by O&M procedures.
ix) The same rule applies to the Circuit Group Unblocking procedure with the
only difference that the involved terrestrial circuits are kept marked as
locally \"not blocked\".
x) If a CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message in response to a CIRCUIT
GROUP BLOCK message is received by the circuit slave containing in the status
field blocking acknowledgement indications for circuits which are not to be
blocked, then an appropriate unblock message will be sent for the circuit(s)
concerned.
xi) If a CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message in response to a CIRCUIT
GROUP UNBLOCK message is received by the circuit slave containing in the
status field unblocking acknowledgement indications for circuits which have to
remain marked as locally blocked then an appropriate block message will be
sent for the circuit(s) concerned.
xii) If a CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message which is not expected and
not accepted as an acknowledgement for a CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK message is
received:
a) relating to circuits which all are in the status locally blocked, then the
received CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message will be discarded;
b) related to circuits part or all of which are not in the status locally
blocked then an appropriate unblock message will be sent for the relevant
circuit(s).
xiii) If a CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message which is not expected
and not accepted as an acknowledgement for a CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCK message is
received:
a) relating to circuits none of which is in the status locally blocked, then
the received CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message will be discarded;
b) related to circuits part or all of which are locally blocked then an
appropriate block message will be sent for the relevant circuit(s).
### 3.1.3 Resource Indication
The purpose of the resource indication procedure is:
\- To inform the MSC of the amount:
\- of radio resource that is spare at the BSS and available for traffic
carrying purposes; and
\- of the total amount of the accessible radio resource (i.e. available for
service or currently assigned).
This cannot easily be derived from the traffic that the MSC is carrying. The
MSC may take these pieces of information into account for the external
handover decision.
#### 3.1.3.1 Successful Operation
The procedure relates to a single cell.
The MSC determines the resource information (i.e. the resource available
information and optionally the total resource accessible information) and the
manner in which the BSS transfers this resource information to the MSC by
sending a RESOURCE REQUEST message to the BSS. This message shall contain a
Resource Indication Method Information Element which can be set to one of the
following values:
i) (Spontaneous resource information expected): The BSS shall send the first
RESOURCE INDICATION message without any resource information to the MSC
immediately as an acknowledgement to the RESOURCE REQUEST message and then any
further RESOURCE INDICATION messages spontaneously every time conditions,
defined by O&M, are met in the BSS for the considered cell (e.g. traffic
thresholds, or time interval between two messages). If the O&M conditions for
sending RESOURCE INDICATION messages are met, the BSS may use the Periodicity
IE received in the RESOURCE REQUEST message to determine the time interval
between indications, except that, if the MSC sets the Periodicity IE to zero
then the BSS shall ignore the Periodicity IE. The BSS stays in this mode until
the receipt of a new RESOURCE REQUEST message for the same cell, or a reset
occurs.
ii) (One single resource information expected): The BSS shall return a single
RESOURCE INDICATION message with some resource information immediately. If the
RESOURCE REQUEST message does not contain an Extended Resource indicator IE
the BSS shall then cease any resource information transfer related to the cell
until the receipt of either a new RESOURCE REQUEST message or a reset. If the
RESOURCE REQUEST message contains an Extended Resource Indicator IE the BSS
shall obey the \'Subsequent Mode\' field.
iii) (Periodic resource information expected): The BSS shall return a RESOURCE
INDICATION message with some resource information immediately, and then
periodically, with a period set by MSC (note), until the receipt of either a
new RESOURCE REQUEST message for the same cell or a reset.
NOTE: (The period shall equal the value of the periodicity parameter times 100
ms. If the value of the periodicity parameter is zero, then the message should
be treated as one containing an incorrect value according to sub-clause
3.1.19.4, case 2.)
iv) (No resource information expected): The BSS shall immediately return a
single RESOURCE INDICATION message without any resource information as an
acknowledgement to the RESOURCE REQUEST message and then the BSS to MSC
transfer of resource information related to the cell is disabled until the
receipt of either a new RESOURCE REQUEST message for the same cell or a reset.
The default mode is iv); after a reset, this mode is set for all the cells of
a BSS.
The transfer of resource information related to a given cell from the BSS to
the MSC occurs when the Resource Indication Method Information Element is set
to one of the values i) to iii) in the BSS. The BSS sends RESOURCE INDICATION
messages to the MSC, under the conditions explained above. The RESOURCE
INDICATION message shall contain the Resource Indication Method Information
Element with the same value as it was requested by the MSC, i.e. the BSS is
not allowed to select a method different from the one requested by the MSC.
Furthermore, the RESOURCE INDICATION message may contain the Resource
Available IE and the Total Resource Accessible IE dependent on the selected
method and, in case of the Total Resource Accessible IE, also dependent on the
request from the MSC. If the RESOURCE INDICATION message is just taken as a
simple acknowledgement as stated in method i) and iv), the Total Resource
Accessible IE shall not be returned independent of whether it was requested by
the MSC or not.
For each idle channel the level of interference will be averaged over a period
of Intave. (Intave is a parameter set by O&M command on a per cell basis).
This averaging will be performed immediately before the transmission of the
RESOURCE INDICATION message. The result of this averaging will be used to
classify the average interference level on the idle channels into five
interference bands.
The Resource Available Information Element contains two pieces of information
for each of the five interference bands:
\- The number of half rate TCHs available in that band.
\- The number of full rate TCHs available in that band.
The levels of the five bands are defined by O&M.
### 3.1.4 Reset
#### 3.1.4.1 Global Reset Procedure
The purpose of the reset procedure is to initialise the BSS and MSC in the
event of a failure. The procedure is a global procedure applying to a whole
BSS, and therefore all messages relating to the reset procedure are sent as
global messages using the connectionless mode of the SCCP.
If only a limited part of the MSC or BSS has suffered a failure then clearing
procedures can be used to clear only those affected calls.
##### 3.1.4.1.1 Reset at the BSS
In the event of a failure at the BSS which has resulted in the loss of
transaction reference information, a RESET message is sent to the MSC or, if
the network supports \"Intra domain connection of RAN nodes to multiple CN
nodes\" (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [48]) to all the MSCs towards which the BSS has
signalling connections established. This message is used by the MSC to release
affected calls and erase all affected references, and to put all circuits into
the idle state.
After a guard period of T2 seconds a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message is returned by
the MSC(s) to the BSS indicating that all references have been cleared.
After the sending of the RESET to the MSC(s) a BSS that does not allocate the
circuits shall initiate blocking procedures (Block or Circuit group block
procedures) for all circuits that are locally blocked on the BSS side, the
MSC(s) shall respond as specified in sub-clause 3.1.2. The sending of block
messages shall be done without waiting for the acknowledgement to the RESET
message.
Upon receipt of a RESET message from the BSS an MSC that does not allocate the
circuits shall send block messages (BLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK) for all
circuits that are locally blocked on the MSC side, the BSS shall respond to
these with blocking acknowledge messages as described in sub-clause 3.1.2.
If a RESET message is received with the information element \"A-Interface
Selector for RESET\" indicating both TDM and IP or if the \"A-Interface
Selector for RESET\" is not present in the RESET message, then the RESET
message shall have precedence over all other procedures.
##### 3.1.4.1.2 Reset at the MSC
In the event of a failure at the MSC which has resulted in the loss of
transaction reference information, a RESET message is sent to the BSS. This
message is used by the BSS to release affected calls and erase all affected
references and to put all circuits into the idle state.
After the sending of the RESET to the BSS, an MSC that does not allocate the
circuits shall initiate blocking procedures (Block or Circuit group block
procedures) for all circuits that are locally blocked on the MSC side, the BSS
shall respond as specified in sub-clause 3.1.2. The sending of block messages
shall be done without waiting for the acknowledgement to the RESET message.
Upon receipt of a RESET message from the MSC a BSS that does not allocate the
circuits shall send block messages (BLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK) for all
circuits that were previously locally blocked on the BSS side, the MSC shall
respond to these with blocking acknowledge messages as described in sub-clause
3.1.2.
After a guard period of T13 seconds a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message is returned to
the MSC, indicating that all MSs which were involved in a call are no longer
transmitting and that all references at the BSS have been cleared.
If a RESET message is received with the information element \"A-Interface
Selector for RESET\" indicating both TDM and IP or if the \"A-Interface
Selector for RESET\" is not present in the RESET message, then the RESET
message shall have precedence over all other procedures.
##### 3.1.4.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
###### 3.1.4.1.3.1 Abnormal Condition at the BSS
If the BSS sends a RESET message to the MSC and receives no RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
message within a period T4 then it shall repeat the entire reset procedure.
The sending of the RESET message is repeated a maximum of \"n\" times where n
is an operator matter. After the n-th unsuccessful repetition the procedure is
stopped and the maintenance system is informed.
###### 3.1.4.1.3.2 Abnormal Condition at the MSC
If the MSC sends a RESET message to the BSS and receives no RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
message within a period T16 then it shall repeat the entire reset procedure.
The sending of the RESET message is repeated a maximum of \"n\" times where n
is an operator matter. After the n^th^ unsuccessful repetition the procedure
is stopped and the maintenance system is informed.
#### 3.1.4.2 Reset Circuit
The purpose of the reset circuit procedure is to restore the information in
MSC/BSS in the case of a failure which has affected only a small part of the
equipment (e.g. abnormal SCCP connection release).
##### 3.1.4.2.1 Reset Circuit at the BSS
If a circuit has to be put to idle at the BSS due to either an abnormal
release of the SCCP-connection for a resource that is not configured for
A-interface circuit sharing, or an abnormal release of an SCCP connection for
a terrestrial resource that is configured for A-interface circuit sharing for
which there are no remaining SCCP connections on the resource, a RESET CIRCUIT
message will be sent to the MSC. When the MSC receives this message, it clears
the possible call and puts the circuit, if known, to the idle state. If the
circuit is known, a RESET CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE message is returned to the BSS.
If circuit allocation is done by the BSS and if the circuit is locally blocked
at the MSC a BLOCK message shall be returned to the BSS. The BSS shall then
respond with a BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message, as described in sub-clause 3.1.2.
If the circuit is unknown in the MSC, an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT message is
returned to the BSS.
Timer T19 is used at the BSS to supervise the reset circuit procedure. If the
timer elapses before a response (RESET, RESET CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE or
UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT) is returned to the BSS, the procedure is repeated.
##### 3.1.4.2.2 Reset Circuit at the MSC
If a circuit has to be put to idle at the MSC due to either an abnormal
release of the SCCP-connection for a resource that is not configured as a
shared resource, or an abnormal release of an SCCP connection for a
terrestrial resource that is configured for A-interface circuit sharing for
which there are no remaining SCCP connections for the resource, a RESET
CIRCUIT message will be sent to the BSS. When the BSS receives a RESET CIRCUIT
message, it shall respond with a RESET CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE message in case the
circuit can be put to idle. If circuit allocation is done by the MSC and if
the circuit is locally blocked at the BSS a BLOCK message shall be returned to
the MSC. The MSC shall then respond with a BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE message, as
described in sub-clause 3.1.2. If the circuit is unknown at the BSS, the BSS
shall return an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT message to the MSC.
Timer T12 is used at the MSC to supervise the reset circuit procedure. If the
Timer elapses before a response (RESET, RESET CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE, UNEQUIPPED
CIRCUIT or BLOCK) the reset circuit procedure is repeated.
##### 3.1.4.2.3 Abnormal conditions
If a RESET message is received with the information element \"A-Interface
Selector for RESET\" indicating TDM or if the \"A-Interface Selector for
RESET\" is not present in the RESET message, after sending of a RESET CIRCUIT
message and before receipt of the corresponding response the respective reset
circuit procedure is stopped, i.e. reception of the corresponding RESET
CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE message is not required and no repetition is necessary.
If a RESET CIRCUIT message is received immediately after a RESET CIRCUIT
message has been sent for the same circuit, the corresponding acknowledgement
messages are returned.
The sending of the RESET CIRCUIT message is repeated a maximum of \"n\" times
where n is an operator matter. After the n-th unsuccessful repetition the
procedure is stopped and the maintenance system is informed.
#### 3.1.4.3 Reset IP Resource
This procedure is relevant when a Call Identifier has been previously
sent/received for the concerned connection, i.e. when an IP bearer has been
selected for this call.
The purpose of the Reset IP Resource procedure is to initialise part of the
resources in the BSS in the event of an abnormal failure in the MSC or vice
versa (e.g. Signalling Transport processor reset). The procedure uses
connectionless signalling.
##### 3.1.4.3.1 Reset IP Resource procedure initiated by the BSS
The BSS initiates the procedure by sending a RESET IP RESOURCE message to the
MSC.
The RESET IP RESOURCE message shall include the Call Identifier List and the
Cause with the appropriate cause value (e.g. \"abnormal SCCP connection
release\").
On reception of this message the MSC shall release locally the resources and
references associated to the Call Identifiers indicated in the received
message. The MSC shall always return the RESET IP RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message
to the BSS after all Call Identifier related resources and references have
been released and the MSC shall include the list of Call Identifiers. The list
of Call Identifiers within the RESET IP RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be
in the same order as received in the RESET IP RESOURCE message. Unknown Call
Identifiers shall be reported as released.
The MSC shall provide means to prevent the immediate re-assignment of released
Call Identifiers to minimise the risk that the Reset IP Resource procedure
releases the same Call Identifiers re-assigned to new calls.
Timer Trbss is used at the BSS to supervise the Reset IP Resource procedure.
If the timer elapses before a response message (RESET, RESET IP RESOURCE
ACKNOWLEDGE) is returned to the BSS, then the RESET IP RESOURCE message may be
repeated by the BSS.
##### 3.1.4.3.2 Reset IP Resource procedure initiated by the MSC
The MSC initiates the procedure by sending a RESET IP RESOURCE message to the
BSS.
The RESET IP RESOURCE message shall include the Call Identifier List and the
Cause with the appropriate cause value (e.g. \"abnormal SCCP connection
release\").
On reception of this message the BSS shall release locally the resources and
references associated to the specific Call Identifiers indicated in the
received message. The BSS shall always return the RESET IP RESOURCE
ACKNOWLEDGE message to the MSC after all Call Identifier related resources and
references have been released and the BSS shall include the list of Call
Identifiers. The list of Call Identifiers within the RESET IP RESOURCE
ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be in the same order as received in the RESET IP
RESOURCE message. Unknown Call Identifiers shall be reported as released.
The MSC shall provide means to prevent the immediate re-assignment of released
Call Identifiers to minimise the risk that the Reset IP Resource procedure
releases the same Call Identifiers re-assigned to new calls.
Timer Trmsc is used at the MSC to supervise the Reset IP Resource procedure.
If the Timer elapse before a response message (RESET, RESET IP RESOURCE
ACKNOWLEDGE) is returned to the MSC, then the RESET IP RESOURCE message may be
repeated by the MSC.
##### 3.1.4.3.3 Abnormal conditions
If a RESET message is received with the information element \"A-Interface
Selector for RESET\" indicating IP or if the \"A-Interface Selector for
RESET\" is not present in the RESET message, after sending of a RESET IP
RESOURCE message and before receipt of the corresponding RESET IP RESOURCE
ACKNOWLEDGE message, then the respective Reset IP Resource procedure is
stopped, i.e. the reception of the corresponding RESET IP RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE
message is not required and no repetition is necessary.
If a RESET IP RESOURCE message is received immediately after a RESET IP
RESOURCE message has been sent for the same Call Identifier, then the
corresponding RESET IP RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message is returned after the
resources has been released.
The sending of the RESET IP RESOURCE message is repeated a maximum of n times,
where n is an operator defined value. After the n-th unsuccessful repetition
the procedure is stopped and local resources associated to the specified Call
Identifiers shall be considered as released.
If a RESET IP RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message does not contain exactly the same
Call Identifiers in the Call Identifier List as sent in the related RESET IP
RESOURCE message, the RESET IP RESOURCE message may be repeated.
### 3.1.5 External Handover
The details of the radio information as far as handover is concerned are given
in 3GPP TS 24.008. The relevant network information is given in 3GPP TS
23.009.
Using this protocol the BSS should support handover transitions to and from
any combinations of the following:
\- Channel.
\- SDCCH.
\- Full Rate TCH.
\- Half Rate TCH.
\- Multiple Full Rate TCHs.
In this specification three procedures are defined which can be used for
handover. They are:
\- Handover Required Indication.
\- Handover Resource Allocation.
\- Handover Execution.
(Figure 16 shows an example of a complete handover procedure.)
For any HANDOVER REQUIRED message at most one HANDOVER COMMAND message may be
sent.
In the case of inter-MSC handover the term \"the MSC\" in this sub-clause is
taken to mean the relevant MSC in the handover operation.
The handover procedures are specified in the following sub-clauses.
All messages concerned with handover, with the exception of HANDOVER CANDIDATE
ENQUIRE and HANDOVER CANDIDATE RESPONSE messages, are sent using the
connection oriented mode of the SCCP.
#### 3.1.5.1 Handover Required Indication
If an IP based user plane interface is supported, this procedure shall not be
used when the target BSS and serving BSS are the same.
The handover required indication procedure allows a BSS to request the
handover for a particular MS if it is currently allocated one or more
dedicated resources or currently allocated one dedicated resource and one or
more packet resources (in which case DTM handover is indicated). This is done
by generating a HANDOVER REQUIRED message and sending it from the BSS to the
MSC. If so required by the BSS, the MSC informs the BSS if the handover cannot
be carried out. This is done by a HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message. The
HANDOVER REQUIRED message is sent using the BSSAP SCCP connection already set
up for that transaction. As part of the BSS\'s functions, the BSS continually
monitors all radio information and compares it with parameters such that if
the transmission quality of a given parameter (or set of parameters) passes a
predetermined threshold (set by O&M) then a HANDOVER REQUIRED message is
generated and sent to the MSC.
The BSS shall not initiate the handover required indication procedure in the
case of an MOCN configuration if the Rerouting procedure is ongoing.
##### 3.1.5.1.1 Generation of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message
Generation of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message can be for the following reasons:
\- The BSS has detected that a radio reason exists for a handover to occur.
\- The MSC has initiated a handover candidate enquiry procedure, and this MS
is currently a candidate.
\- A cell change is required at call setup due to congestion, e.g. directed
retry.
\- A cell change is required at call setup if the indication of Service
Handover to another RAT has been received from the MSC (directed retry
initiation).
The HANDOVER REQUIRED message contains the following information elements:
\- Message Type.
\- Cause.
\- Cell Identifier List (preferred).
It should also contain the information elements: \"Current channel type 1\",
\"Old BSS to New BSS information\" and, in case the current channel mode is
speech, \"Speech version (used)\". If an IP based user plane interface is
supported, the information element \"Speech Codec (used)\" is included.
The \"Old BSS to New BSS information\" is used to pass Field Elements from the
old BSS to the new BSS. The information in the \"Old BSS to New BSS
information\" is transparent for the MSC. When the \"Old BSS to New BSS
information\" is present in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message the MSC shall pass
it unchanged to any BSS associated to \"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\"
when initiating the Handover resource allocation procedure. The old BSS must
ensure that the information contained in the \"Old BSS to New BSS
information\" information element is valid for all cells in the \"Cell
Identifier List (preferred)\".
Sub-clause 3.2.1.9 gives coding details of the above message.
The \"Cause\" field indicates the reason for the HANDOVER REQUIRED message
e.g. \"uplink quality poor\" or \"response to MSC invocation\" in the case of
traffic reasons indicated by the MSC.
The Cause value sent should be an indication which can be taken into account
at the target BSS in future handover decision processes, e.g. to reduce
oscillations between BSSs due to the fact that some information (on which the
old BSS decided to initiate the handover) is not available at the target BSS
(e.g. distance, traffic...).
If present the \"Response Request\" Information Element indicates, that the
BSS requires an indication if the HANDOVER REQUIRED message does not result in
a HANDOVER COMMAND message.
If the BSS wants to change the CIC due to a channel change, the BSS sends a
HANDOVER REQUIRED message with the cause \"switch circuit pool\" and the
\"circuit pool list\" information element. The \"circuit pool list\"
information element will allow the BSS to indicate to the MSC from which
circuit pool or pools the new CIC should be chosen.
Except in the case of DTM Handover, the \"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\"
shall identify \"n\" preferred cells. The identified cells are given in order
of preference. The algorithm by which the BSS produces this list is Operator
dependent and is not addressed in the present document. The \"n\" number of
preferred cells is a parameter set by O&M and shall range from 1 to 16. If
\"n\" number of cells cannot be identified, then only as many as are available
shall be encoded and sent (as specified in sub-clause 3.2.2.27). If a LSA
information element has been received for a mobile subscriber indicating LSA
only access, the \"Cell Identifier List\" shall contain only cells that are
allowed for the subscriber. Exclusive access cells are included into the
\"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\" only if they are allowed for the
subscriber or if the connection is an emergency call.
It is mandatory for the BSS to be able to produce this \"Cell Identifier List
(preferred)\". The sending of this list is controlled by the O&M parameter
\"n\". It is mandatory for the MSC to be able to receive and interpret this
Information Element.
For the case of DTM Handover (i.e. where both dedicated and packet resources
are required in the target cell), the \"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\"
shall identify a single cell, which is the same as the cell identified in the
corresponding PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU (see 3GPP TS 48.018).
The BSS may recommend to the MSC to allow queuing or not in the handover
resource allocation procedure by indication in the \"Queuing indicator\"
information element within the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
The old BSS may inform the new BSS of the presently configured channel in the
Current Channel Type 1 information element and in the Current Channel type 2
Field Element. The information contained may be used by the new BSS (e.g. when
building the radio interface HANDOVER COMMAND message). Where discrepancies
occur between the Current Channel Type 1 and the Current Channel Type 2 then
the information in the Current Channel Type 2 shall take precedence if
understood by the new BSS.
If, for this mobile station, the old BSS has received a Gb interface SUSPEND
ACK PDU, then the old BSS shall include the GPRS Suspend information field in
the Old BSS to New BSS IE in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
If the old BSS received a GPRS Suspend information field in the Old BSS to New
BSS IE in any preceding HANDOVER REQUEST message received by the old BSS,
then, the old BSS shall include the GPRS Suspend information field in the Old
BSS to New BSS IE in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
The old BSS may recommend to the new BSS to allow pre-emption or not allow
pre-emption by sending the \"prec\" bit. The new BSS may take this information
into account when performing the Handover resource allocation procedure.
The old BSS may inform the new BSS of radio information pertaining to the
target cell in the \"Target cell radio information\" field element. The old
BSS shall only send the \"Target cell radio information\" field element when
it sends a single cell in the \"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\". This field
element may be used by the new BSS (e.g. for radio channel selection).
NOTE 1: It is not recommended that this information element is included if
more than one cell is sent in the \"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\".
The old BSS may inform the new BSS of the presently configured channel in the
Current Channel Type 1 information element and in the Current Channel type 2
Field Element. The information contained may be used by the new BSS (e.g. when
building the radio interface HANDOVER COMMAND message). Where discrepancies
occur between the Current Channel Type 1 and the Current Channel Type 2 then
the information in the Current Channel Type 2 shall take precedence if
understood by the new BSS.
If the present speech codec is a multi-rate speech codec, the old BSS may
inform the new BSS of the current multi-rate codec configuration by including
the MultiRate configuration information Field Element in the \"Old BSS to New
BSS information\" information element. If the new BSS assigns a multi-rate
speech codec this information may be used by the new BSS, to determine whether
or not to include a MultiRate Configuration IE when building the radio
interface HANDOVER COMMAND message. If an IP based user plane interface is
supported in BSS, the \"Speech Codec (used)\" shall be included in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message. The MSC determines the speech Codec Type and Codec
Configuration and informs the target BSS by the \"Codec List (MSC
Preferred)\".
The old BSS shall inform the new BSS of the MS's last used E-UTRAN PLMN in the
_"Last used E-UTRAN PLMN ID"_ information element included in the _"Old BSS to
New BSS information"_ Information Element if this information is present.
If the old BSS supports dual transfer mode and the mobile station is in dual
transfer mode in the old cell, the old BSS may provide information about the
current resources by including the _Dual Transfer Mode information_ field
element in the \"_Old BSS to New BSS information_ \" Information Element. The
new BSS may use this information to determine the resources for the mobile
station in the new cell (e.g. half rate traffic channel, adjacent resources
available, EGPRS‑capable resource).
For the DTM Handover procedure, the old BSS shall include the _PS Indication_
information element within the \"_Old BSS to New BSS Information\"_
Information Element. The contents of the _PS Indication IE_ shall uniquely
identify, for this MS, the handover attempt, and shall be identical to the
contents of the _CS Indication IE_ included in the PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED PDU
(see 3GPP TS 48.018).
The old BSS may provide information about the traffic load of the old cell by
including the _Downlink Cell Load Information_ and/or the _Uplink Cell Load
Information_ field elements in the \"_Old BSS to New BSS information\"_
Information Element. This information shall represent the current traffic load
in the cell, that is, prior to the handover procedure. The new BSS may use the
information:
\- prior to a cell load based handover procedure, to determine whether or not
to initiate the handover procedure; and
\- in any handover procedure, to update in the new BSS the information about
the load on the old cell, which may be used in the initiation of future
handover procedures.
NOTE 2: The old BSS should not initiate a cell load based handover procedure
if it has knowledge of the load in the target cell and, after a successful
completion of the handover procedure, this load would be higher than in the
old cell.
In case of handover of a VGCS talking subscriber, the BSS may provide
information about the current VGCS talker mode (ie dedicated or group
transmit) if the group call is ciphered.
The old BSS may recommend the new BSS not to attempt handovers of this mobile
station to UMTS by sending the \"UE-prob\" bit. The new BSS may take this
information into account before starting an Inter-System Handover Required
Indication procedure towards UMTS.
Except when sent as part of a DTM Handover procedure, the HANDOVER REQUIRED
message shall be updated and repeated by the BSS with a periodicity of T7
until:
\- A HANDOVER COMMAND message is received from the MSC; or
\- A RESET message is received; or
\- The reason for the original HANDOVER REQUIRED message disappears e.g. the
MS transmission improves; or
\- All communication is lost with the MS as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008, and the
transaction is abandoned; or
\- The transaction ends, e.g. call clearing.
On sending the HANDOVER REQUIRED message as part of a DTM Handover procedure,
the old BSS shall start timer T23.
The old BSS shall stop timer T23 when it has received responses from both the
MSC and the SGSN:
\- from the MSC, a response consisting of either a HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT or
a BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message; and,
\- from the SGSN, a response consisting of either a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK
PDU or a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU.
The old BSS shall stop timer T23 if it receives from the MSC a BSSMAP HANDOVER
COMMAND message containing a (RR) HANDOVER COMMAND message and chooses to
proceed with the handover of the dedicated resource only or if it receives
from the MSC a BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message containing an (RLC/MAC) DTM
HANDOVER COMMAND message and chooses to begin transmission of the radio
interface message to the MS without first waiting for the PS-HANDOVER-
REQUIRED-ACK PDU (see sub-clause 3.1.5.3.1).
##### 3.1.5.1.2 Abnormal conditions for DTM Handover
If timer T23 expires, no message shall be sent to the MS. The subsequent
action by the old BSS depends on the messages received prior to the expiry of
T23 relating to this handover attempt:
\- If the old BSS has received a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU, it shall
initiate a PS Handover Cancel procedure (see 3GPP TS 48.018).
\- If the old BSS has received a BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message it shall send
a HANDOVER FAILURE message to the MSC with cause \"DTM Handover - Timer
Expired\".
\- If the old BSS has received neither a BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message nor a
PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU, then the handover procedure is terminated and no
message is sent to either the MSC or the SGSN.
\- Any message or PDU relating to this handover attempt which is received from
the MSC or the SGSN after the expiry of timer T23 is discarded.
If the old BSS receives a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU and a HANDOVER
REQUIRED REJECT message then the DTM Handover procedure is terminated and no
message shall be sent to either the MSC or the SGSN or the MS.
If the old BSS receives a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU (with cause e.g.
\"Equipment Failure\") and a BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message which contains a
_DTM Handover Command Indication_ field element within the _New BSS to Old BSS
Information_ IE then the old BSS shall send a HANDOVER FAILURE message to the
MSC with cause \"DTM Handover - SGSN failure\". No message shall be sent to
the MS.
If the old BSS receives a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU (with cause e.g. \"DTM
Handover - PS Allocation Failure\") and a BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message
which does not contain a _DTM Handover Command Indication_ field element
within the _New BSS to Old BSS Information_ IE and the old BSS has chosen not
to proceed with Handover Execution, then the BSS shall send a HANDOVER FAILURE
message to the MSC with cause \"DTM Handover - PS Allocation Failure\". No
message shall be sent to the MS.
If the old BSS receives a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU and a HANDOVER REQUIRED
REJECT message then the BSS shall initiate a PS Handover Cancel procedure (see
3GPP TS 48.018). No message shall be sent to the MS.
#### 3.1.5.2 Handover Resource allocation
This procedure has been defined to allow the MSC to request resources from a
BSS in a manner similar to that used for the assignment case. However it does
not result in the transmission of any messages over the radio interface, only
in the reservation of the resource(s) identified at the BSS, which awaits
access of a MS on the reserved channel(s). These reserved resources are then
indicated back to the MSC.
In order to support this procedure the MSC sets up a BSSAP SCCP connection to
the BSS. This connection is then used to support all BSSAP messages related to
the dedicated resource(s).
In case of Voice Group Call, the MSC may reuse the existing Resource
Controlling SCCP connection which has been previously set-up with the new BSS.
##### 3.1.5.2.1 Operation of the procedure
The correct operation of the handover resource allocation procedure is as
follows:
The MSC sends a HANDOVER REQUEST message to the new BSS (note) from which it
requires radio resources. This message contains details of the resource(s)
required. If the MSC allocates the A interface circuits, and if the requested
resource(s) is/are for speech or data the message also indicates the
terrestrial resource that shall be used between the MSC and the BSS. The MSC
should only ever ask for resources from the BSS that it knows are not totally
incompatible with the nominated circuit. The type of channel(s) required can
be different from the type of channel(s) in use, e.g. in the case of directed
retry. The description of the resource(s) can either be a complete
specification, or give the BSS some freedom in the selection (for instance
channel rate selection, speech version selection etc.). The message may also
specify the channel(s) in use, and, in case current channel mode is speech,
the speech version used. If an IP based user plane interface is supported, the
\"Codec List (MSC Preferred)\" shall be included in the message.
In case of Voice Group Call, the MSC need not allocate a new A interface
circuit. In such a case, the terrestrial resource which has been allocated
during the VBS/VGCS assignment procedure is used as the new terrestrial
resource. The MSC shall not send a HANDOVER REQUEST message to the BSS to
handover a VGCS talker to a cell that has been reported as released through
the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message for that group call.
On receipt of this message the new BSS shall choose suitable idle radio
resources and, if the BSS allocates the A interface circuits and if needed, a
terrestrial resource.
In case of Voice Group Call, the new BSS need not allocate new radio
resources. In such a case, the radio resource which has been allocated during
the VBS/VGCS assignment procedure is used as the new radio resource.
The management of priority levels - relating to the Information Element
\"Priority\" within the HANDOVER REQUEST message - is implementation
dependent, under operator control.
If queuing is managed, new requests which cannot be served immediately are put
in the queuing file according to the indicated priority levels.
(Refer to sub-clause 3.1.17 for Queuing Procedure.)
As a further operator option, the pre-emption indicators may (alone or along
with the priority levels) be used to manage the pre-emption process, which may
lead to the forced release or forced handover of lower priority connections.
However, the pre-emption indicators (refer to sub-clause 3.2.2.18), if given
in the HANDOVER REQUEST, shall be treated on a per connection basis as
follows:
\- The last received \"Pre-emption Vulnerability\" indicator and priority
levels shall prevail.
\- If the \"Pre-emption Capability\" bit is set to 1, then this allocation
request can trigger the running of the pre-emption procedure.
\- If the \"Pre-emption Recommendation\" bit indicates that pre-emption is
recommended by the old BSS, then the new BSS may obey the recommendation and
act appropriately based on \"Pre-emption Capability Indication\" bit.
\- If the \"Pre-emption Recommendation\" bit indicates that pre-emption is not
recommended by the old BSS, then the new BSS may obey this recommendation and
ignore the \"Pre-emption Capability\" bit if it is set to 1.
\- If the \"Pre-emption Recommendation\" bit is not present then the pre-
emption procedure can be run.
\- If the \"Pre-emption Capability\" bit is set to 0, then this allocation
request cannot trigger the pre-emption procedure.
\- If the \"Pre-emption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 1, then this connection
is vulnerable and shall be included in the pre-emption process or procedure
and as such may be subject to forced release or forced handover.
\- If the \"Pre-emption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 0, then this connection
is not vulnerable to pre-emption and shall not be included in the pre-emption
process and as such may not be subject to forced release or forced handover.
\- If no Priority Information Element has been received, both \"Pre-emption
Capability\" and \"Pre-emption Vulnerability\" bits shall be regarded as set
to 0.
In the case where localised service area is supported, the MSC may inform the
BSS as to which LSA identities that the mobile has preferences by sending the
LSA INFORMATION message. The BSS stores this information and uses it when
determining the target cell list for handover. The algorithm for determining
the target cell list for handover is not defined further in the present
document.
In the case where Intersystem handover to other RATs is supported, the MSC may
inform the target BSS, if preference for other radio access technologies
(Service based handover) shall be applied to the MS connection. In such cases
the MSC sets the Service Handover Information Element accordingly in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message. The Service Handover information is stored in the
BSS throughout the connection and is used in Handover evaluation process.
If the MSC determines that CS to PS SRVCC is allowed for this particular
connection, the MSC includes the CS to PS SRVCC IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message.
Upon reception of a HANDOVER REQUEST message including the CS to PS SRVCC IE,
the BSS may trigger the CS to PS SRVCC procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018)
according to the reported capabilities of the MS.
Upon reception of a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing a _PS Indication_ IE
within the _Old BSS to New BSS Information_ information element (i.e. a DTM
Handover procedure is ongoing), then the new BSS shall proceed as follows:
\- If timer T24 is not running, then the new BSS shall start timer T24.
\- When a HANDOVER REQUEST message and PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST PDU have been
received and the contents of the _PS Indication_ and _CS Indication_ IEs are
identical, the new BSS shall stop timer T24 and attempt to allocate a
dedicated resource and, conditional on the allocation of a the dedicated
resource, packet resources (see 3GPP TS 48.018) in accordance with the
capabilities of the MS.
If a dedicated radio resource is available then this will be reflected back to
the MSC in a HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. If the MSC gave the BSS
some freedom in resource type selection, the choices made by the BSS are
indicated in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. If the BSS allocates
the A interface circuits and such a circuit is needed, the circuit allocated
by the BSS is indicated in the HANDOVER ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If only dedicated resources are allocated, the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message sent by the new BSS shall contain the radio interface message HANDOVER
COMMAND within its \"Layer 3 Information\" Information Element.
If, in the case of DTM Handover, both dedicated and packet resources are
allocated, the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message sent by the new BSS shall
contain the radio interface message DTM HANDOVER COMMAND within its \"Layer 3
Information\" Information Element.
The \"Layer 3 Information\" (which is in fact either a RR-Layer 3 HANDOVER
COMMAND or a RLC/MAC-Layer 2 DTM HANDOVER COMMAND) is transferred by the
controlling MSC to the old BSS using the BSSMAP message HANDOVER COMMAND also
within the Information Element \"Layer 3 Information\" of that BSSMAP message.
The new BSS shall indicate that the _Layer 3 Information_ IE contains an
RLC/MAC DTM HANDOVER COMMAND by including the _DTM Handover Command
Indication_ field element within the _New BSS to Old BSS Information_ IE.
Information about the appropriate new channels and a handover reference number
chosen by the new BSS are contained in the HANDOVER COMMAND or DTM HANDOVER
COMMAND. Knowledge of the channel in use at the old BSS allows the new BSS to
minimize the size of the HANDOVER COMMAND or DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message
(i.e. to decide whether the mode of the first channel IE need not be included
in the HANDOVER COMMAND). Furthermore, in the case of handover of a VGCS
talking subscriber, knowledge of the VGCS talker mode at the old BSS also
allows the new BSS to optimise the size of the HANDOVER COMMAND message.
NOTE 1: The new BSS and the old BSS may be the same. If an IP based user plane
interface is supported, this procedure can not be used when the target BSS and
serving BSS are the same.
In the case of external handover the BSS, when localised service area is
supported, will indicate the LSA identity of the target cell in the HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message if it corresponds to one of the LSA identities
received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message.
When several circuit pools are present on the BSS MSC interface, and a circuit
has been allocated by the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the \"circuit pool\"
information field shall be included in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE. The
\"circuit pool\" field will indicate to the MSC the circuit pool of the CIC
given in the HANDOVER REQUEST message.
In the case of a handover from _A/Gb mode_ to _A/Gb mode_ , the _New BSS to
Old BSS Information_ information element is used to pass Field Elements from
the new BSS to the old BSS. The information in the _New BSS to Old BSS
information_ information element is transparent for the MSC. When the _New BSS
to Old BSS information_ information element is present in the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message, the MSC may pass it to the old BSS when initiating the
Handover Execution procedure.
In the case of a handover from _Iu mode_ (GERAN or UTRAN) to _A/Gb mode_ , the
_Inter-System Information_ information element is used to pass Field Elements
from the new BSS to the old system. The information in the _Inter-System
Information_ information element is transparent for the MSC. When the _Inter-
System Information_ information element is present in the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message, the MSC may pass it to the old system.
The new BSS may provide information about the traffic load of the target cell
by including the _Downlink Cell Load Information_ and/or the _Uplink Cell Load
Information_ field elements in the _New BSS to Old BSS information_ or in the
_Inter-System Information_ information elements. This information shall
represent the traffic load in the cell assuming a successful completion of the
handover procedure in progress. The old BSS may use the information to update
the information about the load on the new cell, which may be used in the
initiation of future cell load based handover procedures.
If local switching is requested by the core network, the MSC includes the
Global Call Reference IE, LCLS-Configuration IE and the LCLS-Connection-
Status-Control IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message.
If the BSS supports Local Call Local Switch (LCLS) and receives the HANDOVER
REQUEST message containing the Global Call Reference IE, the LCLS-
Configuration IE and the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE, then the BSS shall
store the Global Call Reference (GCR) value and check if the requested LCLS
configuration included in the LCLS-Configuration IE is supported.
\- If the requested LCLS configuration is not supported, then the BSS shall
indicate this to the MSC in the LCLS-BSS-Status IE included in the HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, see sub-clause 3.1.33.2.3.
\- If the BSS supports the requested LCLS configuration, then the BSS shall
perform call leg correlation as described in sub-clause 3.1.33.2.1 and report
the outcome to the MSC in LCLS-BSS-Status IE included in the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the call becomes local, then the BSS shall notify the MSC serving the
other call leg, see sub-clause 3.1.33.5.
NOTE 2: The BSS shall during the handover procedure indicate the final **LCLS
connection status** value within the HANDOVER COMPLETE message, see sub-clause
3.1.5.3.1.
NOTE 3: If the BSS does not support LCLS then the Global Call Reference IE,
the LCLS-Configuration IE and the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message will be ignored by the BSS and no LCLS-BSS-Status IE
will be returned in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message and in the
HANDOVER COMPLETE message.
If the target BSS supports DTM and network sharing and the Classmark Type 3 IE
received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message indicates a MS supporting network
sharing and DTM, then the new BSS shall include the PLMN Index (see 3GPP TS
44.018) corresponding to the PLMN received in the Cell Identifier (Target) IE
in the HANDOVER REQUEST message either in the HANDOVER COMMAND or DTM HANDOVER
COMMAND message if DTM handover procedure is used (see 3GPP TS 44.018).
The sending of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE by the new BSS to the MSC ends
the Handover Resource Allocation procedure. The Handover Execution procedure
can now proceed and this is given in sub-clause 3.1.5.3.
The new BSS shall then take all necessary action to allow the MS to access the
radio resource(s) that the new BSS has chosen, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS
45 series of Technical Specifications. If the radio resource(s) is a traffic
channel or a group of traffic channels, then the new BSS shall at this point
switch it through to the terrestrial resource indicated in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, and the necessary transcoding/rate adaption/encryption
equipment enabled as detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008.
The optimum procedure for switching through to the target cell at the MSC is
not defined in these Technical Specifications.
If either:
\- a CLEAR COMMAND is received from the MSC; or
\- a reset is received from the MSC,
then the Handover Resource Allocation procedure shall be cancelled and the
possibly already allocated radio resources shall be released and the
terrestrial resources marked as idle.
##### 3.1.5.2.2 Handover Resource Allocation Failure
The following failure conditions of this procedure may occur:
The BSS may not be able to use the terrestrial resource (that is, a
terrestrial circuit or an IP based user plane interface) that the MSC has
indicated in which case a HANDOVER FAILURE message will be returned with the
Cause value set to: \"requested terrestrial resource unavailable\".
The BSS may not be able to support the requested ciphering algorithm and in
this case a HANDOVER FAILURE message shall be returned to the MSC with the
Cause value \"Ciphering algorithm not supported\".
If the requested channel type or resource (e.g. channel rate, speech version,
Codec Type, Codec Configuration, Interface Type, etc.) indicated in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message is temporarily not available (e.g. due to overload)
or not supported in the BSS, then a HANDOVER FAILURE message shall be returned
to the MSC. The appropriate failure cause will be included in the message
(Cause value: \"requested transcoding/rate adaptation unavailable\" or
\"requested speech version unavailable\" or \"Requested Codec Type or Codec
Configuration unavailable\" or \"Requested Codec Type or Codec Configuration
not supported\" or \"Requested A-Interface Type unavailable\" or \"Requested
A-Interface Type not supported\").
If the MSC requested an IP-bearer for the A-Interface by providing the AoIP
Transport Layer Address and not providing a Circuit Identity Code, but the BSS
is not able to use an IP-bearer, then the BSS shall not allocate a Circuit
Identity Code on its own, even if the Codec List (MSC Preferred) included a
Codec Type with the PT bit set to \"1\", but shall return a HANDOVER FAILURE
message to the MSC with the Cause value \"Requested A-Interface Type
unavailable\".
If, on reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST by the BSS, the circuit pool implied
by the CIC information element is incompatible with the channel type indicated
(that is, the pool does not support any of the radio resources indicated by
the channel type) a HANDOVER FAILURE shall be returned to the MSC with the
failure cause set to \"circuit pool mismatch\".
If, on reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST by the BSS, the circuit pool implied
by the CIC is compatible with the channel type indicated (that is, the pool
supports at least one of the radio resource types indicated by the channel
type), but the BSS still wishes to change the circuit pool, it sends a
HANDOVER FAILURE with the cause \"switch circuit pool\" and the \"circuit pool
list\" information element.
The \"circuit pool\" information element, when present in the HANDOVER
FAILURE, indicates to the MSC which circuit pool the CIC indicated in the
HANDOVER REQUEST belongs to. This can be used by the MSC to correct its tables
(CIC/circuit pool). The \"circuit pool list\" information element, when
present in the HANDOVER FAILURE, is used when the BSS wishes to indicate to
the MSC its preferred circuit pools. The circuit pools in the \"circuit pool
list\" information element shall be given in order of preference. In the case
of a HANDOVER FAILURE with the cause \"circuit pool mismatch\", the MSC may
decide to block the circuit and to send an O & M notification.
Other possible cause values which may be returned with the HANDOVER FAILURE
message are: \"equipment failure\", \"no radio resource available\", \"O&M
intervention\".
The MSC may not be able to use the terrestrial resource that the BSS has
indicated. In this case, the procedure is nevertheless considered terminated
successfully, and it is up to the MSC to correct the situation, e.g. by a
circuit re‑selection procedure.
If a DTM Handover is ongoing and the allocation of the packet resources fails
(i.e. the PS Handover Request procedure (see 3GPP TS 48.018) fails at the new
BSS), then the new BSS shall send a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU with cause
\"DTM Handover - PS Allocation failure\" to the SGSN (see 3GPP TS 48.018) and
either terminate the Handover Resource Allocation procedure and send a
HANDOVER FAILURE message with cause \"DTM Handover \- PS Allocation failure\"
to the MSC, or proceed with the Handover Resource Allocation procedure
allocating only a dedicated resource (see sub-clause 3.1.5.2.3).
If a DTM Handover is ongoing, then a failure in the allocation of the
dedicated resource for any of the reasons described above shall implicitly
cause the allocation of PS resources as part of the corresponding PS Handover
Request procedure to fail in the new BSS (see 3GPP TS 48.018). In this case
the new BSS shall terminate the Handover Resource Allocation procedure by
sending a HANDOVER FAILURE message (with appropriate cause e.g. \"No radio
resource available\") to the MSC and a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU with cause
\"DTM Handover - No CS Resource\" to the SGSN (see 3GPP TS 48.018).
The _New BSS to Old BSS information_ information element is used to pass Field
Elements from the new BSS to the old BSS. The information in the _New BSS to
Old BSS information_ information element is transparent for the MSC. When the
_New BSS to Old BSS information_ information element is present in the
HANDOVER FAILURE message, the MSC may pass it to the old BSS in the HANDOVER
REQUIRED REJECT message.
The new BSS may provide information about the traffic load of the target cell
by including the _Downlink Cell Load Information_ and/or the _Uplink Cell Load
Information_ field elements in the _New BSS to Old BSS information_
information element. This information shall represent the current traffic load
in the cell. The old BSS may use the information to update the information
about the load on the new cell, which may be used in the initiation of future
cell load based handover procedures.
NOTE: The new BSS may reject the attempt of a cell load based handover
procedure if the load in the target cell after a successful completion of the
handover procedure would be higher than in the old cell.
The generation of the HANDOVER FAILURE message terminates the procedure and
allows all references in the new BSS to be released.
Further actions in the MSC concerning handover depend upon the handover
algorithm which is operator dependent. If an unrecognised Handover Failure
cause value is received, the Class of the cause value should be used to
determine the MSC\'s action.
##### 3.1.5.2.3 Abnormal conditions
If after receipt of a HANDOVER REQUEST message, the new BSS receives another
HANDOVER REQUEST message on the same SCCP connection, then the later message
will be discarded.
If the BSS receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message allocating a terrestrial
circuit which the BSS has marked as blocked by a previous blocking procedure,
then a HANDOVER FAILURE message shall be returned to the MSC with the Cause
set to \"requested terrestrial resource unavailable\". A single global BLOCK
message (not repeated and not guarded by timer T1) shall be sent for that
concerned terrestrial circuit.
If the BSS receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message indicating a target cell which
is not controlled by the BSS, then a HANDOVER FAILURE message shall be
returned to the MSC with the cause set to \"invalid cell\".
If timer T24 expires and the new BSS has received a HANDOVER REQUEST message
(i.e. no corresponding PS HANDOVER REQUEST PDU has been received), the new BSS
may either abort the Handover Resource Allocation procedure by sending a
HANDOVER FAILURE message to the MSC with cause \"DTM Handover - Timer
Expiry\", or continue with the Handover Resource Allocation procedure,
allocating only a dedicated resource. In the latter case, the new BSS sends a
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the MSC with the _Layer 3 Information_
IE containing an RR HANDOVER COMMAND message, does not include the _DTM
Handover Command Indication_ field element within the _New BSS to Old BSS
Information_ IE and no longer considers the DTM Handover procedure to be
ongoing. In either case, the new BSS shall store the contents of the _PS
Indication_ IE and the identity of the MS.
If timer T24 expires and the new BSS has received a PS HANDOVER REQUEST PDU
(i.e. no corresponding HANDOVER REQUEST message has been received), the
ongoing PS Handover Request procedure implicitly fails and the new BSS shall
send a PS-HANDOVER-REQUEST-NACK PDU to the SGSN with cause \"DTM Handover -
Timer expiry\" (see 3GPP TS 48.018).If the new BSS receives a HANDOVER REQUEST
containing a _PS Indication_ IE which corresponds to a handover procedure
which has previously been terminated due to the expiry of timer T24, then it
shall send a HANDOVER FAILURE message to the MSC with cause \"DTM Handover -
Invalid PS Indication\". Any ongoing Handover Resource Allocation procedure
corresponding to the same mobile station (i.e. one identified by a different
PS Indication Contents in the _PS Indication_ IE) should continue.
#### 3.1.5.3 Handover execution
If a DTM Handover procedure is not ongoing, handover execution in the context
of the BSS/MSC interface is the process whereby an MSC instructs an MS to tune
to a new dedicated radio resource or to a group of radio resources, which may
be on a different cell.
If a DTM Handover procedure is ongoing, then Handover Execution is the process
whereby the radio interface DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message is transmitted to the
MS by the old BSS.
##### 3.1.5.3.1 Operation of the procedure
The correct operation of the procedure is as follows:
The BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message is generated by the MSC and transmitted
over the BSSAP connection to the old BSS which is currently supporting the
concerned MS.
Except in the case of DTM Handover, the radio interface HANDOVER COMMAND
message is sent by the old BSS, to the concerned MS once the old BSS has
received the BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message.
If, in the case of DTM Handover, the old BSS receives from the MSC a BSSMAP
HANDOVER COMMAND message and the _DTM Handover Command Indication_ field
element is included within the _New BSS to Old BSS Information_ IE, the old
BSS should wait until it receives a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU (if it has
not already), then stop timer T23 and transmit the (RLC/MAC) DTM HANDOVER
COMMAND radio interface message to the MS (see 3GPP TS 44.060). Alternatively,
the old BSS may transmit the (RLC/MAC) DTM HANDOVER COMMAND and stop timer T23
without waiting for a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-ACK PDU. If, in this case, the old
BSS subsequently receives a PS-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-NACK PDU before it has
completed transmission of the (RLC/MAC) DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message it should
abort the transmission of the message and proceed as described in sub-clause
3.1.5.1.2.
If, in the case of DTM Handover, the old BSS receives from the MSC a BSSMAP
HANDOVER COMMAND message and the _DTM Handover Command Indication_ field
element is not included within the _New BSS to Old BSS Information_ IE and the
old BSS chooses to proceed with the Handover Execution procedure, it shall
stop T23 and send the RR HANDOVER COMMAND message to the MS.
NOTE: If the old BSS chooses not to proceed with the Handover Execution in
this case, then it shall proceed as specified in sub-clause 3.1.5.1.2.
In the case of DTM Handover, the old BSS shall start timer T8 when it sends
the DTM HANDOVER COMMAND (or RR HANDOVER COMMAND message, if it proceeds with
the Handover Execution procedure when only a dedicated resource was allocated)
to the mobile. Otherwise, the old BSS shall start timer T8 on receipt of the
BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message.
The air interface message (either DTM HANDOVER COMMAND or RR HANDOVER COMMAND)
contains a handover reference number, previously allocated by the new BSS.
The BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message generated by the MSC may contain a _Cell
Identifier_ IE which indicates to the old BSS the target cell identity to
which the handover is to be performed. In case of failure, this information
allows the old BSS to know on which cell the handover failed.
The BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message may contain information about the traffic
load of the new cell by including the _Downlink Cell Load Information_ and/or
the _Uplink Cell Load Information_ field elements in the _New BSS to Old BSS
information_ information element. The old BSS may use the information to
update the information about the load on the new cell, which may be used in
the initiation of future cell load based handover procedures.
When the MS accesses the radio resource(s) of the new BSS with a HANDOVER
ACCESS burst which contains the received handover reference number then:
\- The new BSS checks the handover reference number to ensure that it is the
same as expected, and hence that there is a high probability that the correct
MS has been captured (if the handover reference is not as expected then the
new BSS shall wait for an access by the correct MS).
\- If the handover reference number is as expected, the new BSS shall send a
HANDOVER DETECT message to the MSC.
\- When the MS is successfully in communication with the network, i.e. the RR
message HANDOVER COMPLETE has been received from the MS, then the new BSS will
immediately send a BSSMAP message HANDOVER COMPLETE to the MSC and, in the
case of DTM Handover, a PS-HANDOVER-COMPLETE PDU to the SGSN (see 3GPP TS
48.018), and terminate the procedure.
If LCLS is supported in the BSS and the BSS determines that the call is an
intra-BSS call which can be locally switched it shall not through-connect the
two parties unless explicitly indicated to do so in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message by receiving the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to \"Connect\"
and the other call leg has previously received LCLS-Connection-Status-Control
IE set to \"Connect\".
If local switching is requested by the core network and LCLS is supported in
the BSS, the BSS shall inform the MSC of the local switch establishment
outcome by including the LCLS-BSS-Status IE with the correct **LCLS connection
status** value according to sub-clause 3.2.2.119 within the BSSMAP HANDOVER
COMPLETE message. The BSS shall also notify the MSC serving the other call leg
if the LCLS connection status is changed for this call leg, see sub-clause
3.1.33.5.
In the case where the new BSS hands the MS to a Group call channel, the BSS
shall send a CLEAR REQUEST with cause \"Joined group call channel\" directly
after having sent the HANDOVER COMPLETE message.
In the case of point to point calls the MSC shall terminate the procedure with
the old BSS by sending a CLEAR COMMAND with cause \"Handover successful\".
In the case of a handover from a Group call channel the MSC shall terminate
the procedure by sending a HANDOVER SUCCEEDED message. On receipt of a
HANDOVER SUCCEEDED from the MSC, the old BSS shall stop timer T8.
The old dedicated radio resource(s) and connected terrestrial resource shall
remain assigned until either the MSC instructs the old BSS to release the
resource(s) by a CLEAR COMMAND or a reset occurs.
After the completion of the handover procedure, until the connection is
released or the MSC performs an assignment, any dedicated resource assigned to
the mobile station, e.g. at internal handover, must be in accordance with the
description in the HANDOVER REQUEST message.
If either:
\- a CLEAR COMMAND is received from the MSC; or
\- a reset is received from the MSC,
before an MS with the correct handover reference accesses the new BSS then the
radio resources shall be released and the terrestrial resources marked as idle
The relevant radio interface layer 3 procedures are described in 3GPP TS
24.008.
The MSC always terminates this procedure by use of a clear sequence as
follows:
\- The MSC sends a CLEAR COMMAND to the old BSS. On receipt of a CLEAR COMMAND
from the MSC the old BSS shall stop timer T8 and release all involved
resources that were allocated to the MS that had been handed over and returns
a CLEAR COMPLETE message to the MSC.
\- On receipt of the CLEAR COMPLETE, the MSC shall initiate the release of the
SCCP connection to the old BSS and thereby terminate association with the old
BSS for this process.
##### 3.1.5.3.2 Handover Failure
If a HANDOVER FAILURE message radio interface message is received from the MS
on the old (main) channel by the old BSS, the old BSS shall then send to the
MSC the BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE message and, in the case of DTM Handover, the
old BSS shall also start the PS Handover Cancel procedure (see 3GPP TS
48.018). If the radio interface HANDOVER FAILURE message is the result of the
MS returning to the old BSS after failing to establish on the new BSS, then
the cause value \"radio interface failure, reversion to old channel\" shall be
included in the BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE message. Furthermore, it is
recommended that the air interface RR cause be included as well in this
message.
If the MSC receives the BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE message from the old BSS (with
any cause value) and if the target channel is not a Group Call Channel, the
handover procedure at the target new BSS is then terminated by the MSC using a
clear sequence as follows:
\- The MSC sends a CLEAR COMMAND message with the cause \"Radio interface
failure, reversion to old channel\" to the new BSS. On receipt of a CLEAR
COMMAND message from the MSC, the new BSS shall release all involved resources
that were allocated during the handover resource allocation procedure and
return a CLEAR COMPLETE message to the MSC.
\- On receipt of the CLEAR COMPLETE message, the MSC shall initiate the
release of the SCCP connection to the new BSS and thereby terminate the
association with the new BSS for this process.
The call between the MS and the old BSS and between the old BSS and the MSC
shall continue as if there had been no handover attempt.
Further actions in the MSC concerning handover depends on the handover
algorithm which is operator dependent.
In the case of a talker on a group call channel the MS may release the uplink
whilst the handover is being performed, in this case the old BSS shall cancel
the handover internally, the MSC should cancel the handover and initiate the
release of the A interface resources allocated in the new BSS.
##### 3.1.5.3.3 Abnormal Conditions
Whilst the handover execution procedure is in operation, any other messages
received at the old BSS relating to this connection and concerning assignment,
handover, or cipher mode control should be discarded.
Whilst the handover execution procedure is in operation the old BSS should not
attempt to invoke any other procedure related to this call e.g. handover
required indication.
If at the old BSS a CLEAR COMMAND message from the MSC or a HANDOVER FAILURE
message from the MS is not received before the expiry of timer T8 then the old
BSS shall release the dedicated radio resources. A BSSMAP message CLEAR
REQUEST is also sent to the MSC with a cause \"Radio Interface Message
Failure\". The terrestrial resource in the old BSS shall remain assigned until
a CLEAR COMMAND message is received from the MSC, at which point the old BSS
shall mark the terrestrial resources as IDLE and return a CLEAR COMPLETE
message to the MSC. The MSC shall subsequently release the SCCP connection to
the old BSS and thereby terminate association with the old BSS for this
process.
In case DTM Handover is ongoing, if T8 expires, the old BSS shall also release
the allocated PS resources and initiate a PS Handover Cancel procedure. The
cause value in the PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU shall be set to \"Radio contact lost
with MS\" (see 3GPP TS 48.018).
In the case of a handover from a Group call channel, if at the old BSS a CLEAR
COMMAND or HANDOVER SUCCEEDED message from the MSC or a HANDOVER FAILURE
message from the MS is not received before the expiry of timer T8 then the old
BSS shall release the uplink and send a UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION to the MSC.
The MSC shall also initiate release of the resources allocated by the new BSS
during the handover resource allocation procedure by sending a CLEAR COMMAND
message to the new BSS. The new BSS shall release all the resources that were
assigned for that aborted handover and return a CLEAR COMPLETE message to the
MSC. The MSC shall subsequently release the SCCP connection to the new BSS and
thereby terminate association with the new BSS for this process.
### 3.1.5a Handover from GSM to another System
Using this protocol the BSS should support handover transitions to other
systems from an SDCCH, a Full Rate TCH a Half Rate TCH and Multiple Full Rate
TCHs.
There are three procedures which are used for inter-system handover. They are:
\- Inter-System Handover Required Indication.
\- Inter-System Handover Resource Allocation.
\- Inter-System Handover Execution.
The first and part of the third of these procedures are specified in this
specification. The second and other part of the third procedures are specified
in the relevant specification of the target system.
For any HANDOVER REQUIRED message at most one HANDOVER COMMAND message may be
sent.
If so required by the BSS, the MSC shall inform the BSS if the handover cannot
be carried out. This is done by a HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message.
In the case of inter-MSC handover the term \"the MSC\" in this sub-clause is
taken to mean the relevant MSC in the handover operation.
The inter-system handover procedures are specified in the following sub-
clauses. All messages concerned with inter-system handover are sent using the
connection oriented mode of the SCCP.
#### 3.1.5a.1 Generation of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message for intersystem
handover
The HANDOVER REQUIRED message contains the following information elements:
\- Message Type.
\- Cause.
\- Cell Identifier List.
In case of Inter System Handover to UTRAN or CS to PS SRVCC to UTRAN (HSPA) it
contains the information element: \"Source RNC to target RNC transparent
information\".
The \"Source RNC to target RNC transparent information\" is used to pass
information from the old BSS to the target RNC. The information in the
\"Source RNC to target RNC transparent information\" is transparent for the
MSC. At presence of the \"Source RNC to target RNC transparent information\"
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message the MSC shall pass it unchanged to the Target
RNC when initiating the Handover resource allocation procedure. The Target RNC
is identified by the Target ID information contained in the Cell Identifier
List IE. The Target ID information is structured routing information as
required by the core network (see 3GPP TS 25.413). The information contained
in the \"Source RNC to target RNC transparent information\" information
element is coded as required by the target system.
In case of CS to PS SRVCC to E-UTRAN it contains the information element
\"Source eNB to target eNB transparent information (E-UTRAN)\"
The \"Source eNB to target eNB transparent information (E-UTRAN)\" is used to
pass information from the old BSS to the target eNB. The information in the
\"Source eNB to target eNB transparent information (E-UTRAN)\" is transparent
for the MSC. When the \"Source eNB to target eNB transparent information
(E-UTRAN)\" is present in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message the MSC shall pass it
unchanged to the Target eNB when initiating the Handover resource allocation
procedure. The Target eNB is identified by the Corresponding RNC-ID
information contained in the Cell Identifier List IE. The Corresponding RNC-ID
information is structured routing information as required by the core network
(see 3GPP TS 36.413). The information contained in the \"Source eNB to target
eNB transparent information (E-UTRAN)\" information element is coded as
required by the target system.
In case of CS to PS SRVCC to UTRAN (HSPA) or to E-UTRAN, the BSS shall include
the _CS to PS SRVCC Indication_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
Sub-clause 3.2.1.9 gives coding details of the above message.
The \"Cause\" field indicates the reason for the HANDOVER REQUIRED message
e.g. \"downlink quality\".
The Cell Identification Discriminator field within the Cell Identifier List IE
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message can be used to deduce that this is an
intersystem handover.
If present the \"Response Request\" Information Element indicates, that the
BSS requires an indication if the HANDOVER REQUIRED message does not result in
a HANDOVER COMMAND message.
The Cell Identifier List IE contains the RNC-ID (or the Extended RNC-ID or the
Corresponding RNC-ID) (and additionally the LAC (or TAC) or LAC and PLMN-ID
(or TAC and PLMN-ID) depending on the configuration of the network) of the
target for intersystem handover. In case of DTM Handover to UTRAN, the RNC-ID
(or the Extended RNC-ID) shall be as same as the RNC Identifier specified in
the corresponding PS HANDOVER REQUIRED PDU (see 3GPP TS 48.018).
It is mandatory for BSS to produce the RNC-ID (or the Extended RNC-ID or the
Corresponding RNC-ID). It is mandatory for the MSC to be able to receive and
interpret this Information Element for routeing purpose.
The BSS may recommend to the target RNC to allow pre-emption or not allow pre-
emption by sending the \"prec\" bit. The target RNC may take this information
into account when performing the Handover resource allocation procedure.
In case of handover to a UTRAN CSG cell or a hybrid cell, the source BSS shall
include the _CSG Identifier_ information element in the HANDOVER REQUIRED
message. The source BSS shall set the value of the _Cell Access Mode_ field in
the _CSG Identifier_ information element according to the information received
from the MS through measurement reporting as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.
In case of handover to GERAN _Iu mode_ the BSS may include the \"GERAN
Classmark\" Information Element, indicating the supported CS services of the
target cell in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message (see 3GPP TS 43.051). In case the
serving and the target cells provide the same capabilities with regard to CS
services the exchange of the \"GERAN Classmark\" between RAN and CN is not
required during the handover procedure. In case the serving and the target
cells do not provide the same capabilities with regard to CS services, the
exchange of the \"GERAN Classmark\" between RAN and CN is required during the
handover procedure to avoid that the CN has to store cell related information
and to be able to reuse the existing handover procedure inside the CN.
In case of DTM Handover to UTRAN, the old BSS shall set the _Number of Iu
Instances_ IE equal to 2 in the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container_ IE (see 3GPP TS 25.413)
The old BSS may provide information about the traffic load of the old cell by
including the _Cell Load Information Group_ field elements in the _Source RNC
to Target RNC Transparent Information_ information element. This information
shall represent the current traffic load in the cell, that is, prior to the
handover procedure. This information shall also include the source cell
identifier to which the included traffic load values corresponds. The target
RNC may use the information to update the information about the load on the
old cell, which may be used in the initiation of future cell load based
handover procedures.
NOTE: The old BSS should not initiate a cell load based handover procedure if
it has knowledge of the load in the target cell and, after a successful
completion of the handover procedure, this load would be higher than in the
old cell.
Except when sent as part of an intersystem DTM Handover procedure, the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message shall be updated and repeated by the BSS with a
periodicity of T7 until:
\- A HANDOVER COMMAND message is received from the MSC; or
\- A RESET message is received; or
\- The reason for the original HANDOVER REQUIRED message disappears e.g. the
MS transmission improves; or
\- All communication is lost with the MS as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018, and the
transaction is abandoned; or
\- The transaction ends, e.g. call clearing.
On sending the HANDOVER REQUIRED message as part of a DTM Handover to UTRAN
procedure, the old BSS shall start timer T23. The old BSS shall stop timer T23
as described in sub-clauses 3.1.5.1.1. In case of T23 expiry or the failure of
resource allocation, the old BSS shall behave as described in sub-clause
3.1.5.1.2.
In case of handover to a UTRAN CSG cell, if the MSC receives in the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message the _CSG Identifier_ IE with the _Cell Access Mode_ field set
to "CSG cell", it shall perform access control. If the result indicates that
the MS is allowed to access the target cell the MSC shall continue the
handover to the target side.
In case of handover to a UTRAN Hybrid cell, if the MSC receives in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message the _CSG Identifier_ IE with the _Cell Access Mode_
field set to "Hybrid cell", it shall provide the CSG membership status of the
MS and the _CSG Id_ to the target side.
#### 3.1.5a.2 Inter-System Handover Resource Allocation Failure
If the MSC receives a HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicating an unknown target
RNC or unknown target eNB then, if so required by the BSS, the MSC shall send
a HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message to the old BSS with a cause value
indicating \'invalid cell\'.
If the MSC receives a HANDOVER REQUIRED message with the _CSG Identifier_
information element with the _Cell Access Mode_ field set to "CSG cell", and
the access control indicates that the MS is not allowed to access the target
cell, the MSC shall send a HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message to the old BSS
with a cause value indicating "Invalid CSG cell".
If the MSC receives a HANDOVER REQUIRED message with the _CS to PS SRVCC
Indication_ information element present, and the MSC determines that CS to PS
SRVCC to E-UTRAN or to UTRAN (HSPA) is not possible, the MSC shall send a
HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message to the old BSS with an appropriate cause
value.
If the MSC or the target system is unable to allocate resources for the
handover attempt then, if so required by the BSS, the MSC shall send a
HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message to the old BSS with an appropriate cause
value.
If the target system establishes that the mobile station being handed over
does not support the inter-system procedure correctly and if so required by
the BSC, then the MSC shall send a HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message to the old
BSS with a cause value indicating \'Incoming Relocation Not Supported Due To
PUESBINE Feature\'. The old BSS should not attempt further inter-system
handovers for this mobile station.
The _New BSS to Old BSS information_ information element is used to pass Field
Elements from the new system to the old BSS. The information in the _New BSS
to Old BSS information_ information element is transparent for the MSC. When
the _New BSS to Old BSS information_ information element is present in the
message received from target RNC, the MSC may pass it to the old BSS in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message.
The new BSS may provide information about the traffic load of the target cell
by including the _Downlink Cell Load Information_ and/or the _Uplink Cell Load
Information_ field elements in the _New BSS to Old BSS information_
information element. This information shall represent the current traffic load
in the cell. The old BSS may use the information to update the information
about the load on the new cell, which may be used in the initiation of future
cell load based handover procedures.
#### 3.1.5a.3 Intersystem handover Execution
The correct operation of the procedure is as follows:
The BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message is generated by the MSC and transmitted
over the BSSAP connection to the old BSS which is currently supporting the
concerned MS.
If DTM Handover to UTRAN is not ongoing, then the old BSS shall start timer T8
on the receipt of the BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message which contains the Layer
3 Information IE including radio interface handover command message. An
intersystem handover command radio interface message (e.g. INTER SYSTEM TO
UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND) is then sent by the old BSS, to the concerned MS.
In case of DTM Handover to UTRAN, the old BSS shall start timer T8 when it
sends the (RLC/MAC) DTM HANDOVER COMMAND message containing a (RRC) HANDOVER
TO UTRAN COMMAND message to the concerned MS.
The BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message may contain information about the traffic
load of the new cell by including the _Downlink Cell Load Information_ and/or
the _Uplink Cell Load Information_ field elements in the _New BSS to Old BSS
information_ information element. The old BSS may use the information to
update the information about the load on the new cell, which may be used in
the initiation of future cell load based handover procedures.
In case of CS to PS SRVCC to E-UTRAN or to UTRAN (HSPA), the old BSS shall
start timer T8 on the receipt of the BSSMAP HANDOVER COMMAND message
containing the CN to MS transparent information IE. An intersystem handover
command radio interface message (e.g. INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND
or INTER SYSTEM TO E-UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND) is then sent by the old BSS, to
the concerned MS.
When the MS accesses the radio resource(s) of the new RNC or the new eNB then:
\- the new RNC or the new eNB shall cause a Handover Detect indication to be
sent to the MSC;
\- when the MS is successfully in communication with the network, then the new
RNC or the new eNB shall cause a Handover Complete indication to be sent to
the MSC and terminate the procedure.
The relevant radio interface layer 3 procedures are described in 3GPP TS
25.331, 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 36.331.
The MSC always terminates this procedure by use of a clear sequence as
follows:
\- The MSC sends a CLEAR COMMAND to the old BSS. On receipt of a CLEAR COMMAND
from the MSC the old BSS shall stop timer T8 and release all involved
resources that were allocated to the MS that had been handed over and returns
a CLEAR COMPLETE message to the MSC.
\- On receipt of the CLEAR COMPLETE, the MSC shall initiate the release of the
SCCP connection to the old BSS and thereby terminate association with the old
BSS for this process.
#### 3.1.5a.4 Inter System Handover Failure
If a HANDOVER FAILURE radio interface message is received from the MS on the
old (main) channel by the old BSS, the old BSS shall then send to the MSC the
BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE message and in the case of DTM Handover to UTRAN, the
old BSS shall also start the PS Handover Cancel procedure (see 3GPP TS
48.018).
If the radio interface HANDOVER FAILURE message is the result of the MS
returning to the old BSS after failing to establish on the new channel in the
new RNC or in the new eNB, then the cause value \"radio interface failure,
reversion to old channel\" shall be included in the BSSMAP message HANDOVER
FAILURE. Furthermore, it is recommended that the air interface RR cause be
included as well in this message.
If the MSC receives the BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE message from the old BSS (with
any cause value, the handover procedure at the target is then terminated by
the MSC.
The call between the MS and the old BSS and between the old BSS and the MSC
shall continue as if there had been no handover attempt.
#### 3.1.5a.5 Abnormal Conditions
Whilst the handover execution procedure is in operation, any other messages
received at the old BSS relating to this connection and concerning assignment,
handover, or cipher mode control should be discarded.
Whilst the handover execution procedure is in operation the old BSS should not
attempt to invoke any other procedure related to this call e.g. handover
required indication.
If at the old BSS a CLEAR COMMAND message from the MSC or a HANDOVER FAILURE
message from the MS is not received before the expiry of timer T8 then the old
BSS shall release the dedicated radio resources. A BSSMAP message CLEAR
REQUEST is also sent to the MSC with a cause \"Radio Interface Message
Failure\". The terrestrial resource in the old BSS shall remain assigned until
a CLEAR COMMAND is received from the MSC, at which point the old BSS shall
mark the terrestrial resources as IDLE and return a CLEAR COMPLETE message to
the MSC. The MSC shall subsequently release the SCCP connection to the old BSS
and thereby terminate association with the old BSS for this process.
In case of DTM Handover to UTRAN is ongoing, if T8 expires, the old BSS shall
also release the allocated PS resources and initiate a PS Handover Cancel
procedure. The cause value in the PS-HANDOVER-CANCEL PDU shall be set to
\"Radio contact lost with MS\" (see 3GPP TS 48.018).
In the case of a handover from a Group call channel, if at the old BSS a CLEAR
COMMAND or HANDOVER SUCCEEDED message from the MSC or a HANDOVER FAILURE
message from the MS is not received before the expiry of timer T8 then the old
BSS shall release the uplink and send a UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION to the MSC.
The MSC shall also initiate release of the resources allocated by the new BSS
during the handover resource allocation procedure by sending a CLEAR COMMAND
to the new BSS. The new BSS shall release all the resources that were assigned
for that aborted handover and return a CLEAR COMPLETE to the MSC. The MSC
shall subsequently release the SCCP connection to the new BSS and thereby
terminate association with the new BSS for this process.
In case of CS to PS SRVCC, the MSC shall also initiate release of the
resources allocated by the new RNC or by the new eNB during the handover
resource allocation procedure by sending a release message to the target
system. The new RNC or eNB shall release all the resources that were assigned
for that aborted handover and indicate this to the MSC. The MSC shall
subsequently release the dedicated connection to the new RNC or the new eNB
and thereby terminate the association with the new RNC or eNB for this
process.
### 3.1.5b Handover from another system to GSM
#### 3.1.5b.1 General
Using this protocol the BSS should support handover transitions from other
systems to an SDCCH, a Full Rate TCH a Half Rate TCH and Multiple Full Rate
TCHs.
There are three procedures which are used for handover from another system to
GSM. They are:
\- Inter-System Handover Required Indication.
\- Inter-System Handover Resource Allocation.
\- Inter-System Handover Execution.
The second part of these procedures is specified in this specification. The
first and third parts procedures are specified in the relevant specification
of the source system.
In the case of inter-MSC handover the term \"the MSC\" in this sub-clause is
taken to mean the relevant MSC in the handover operation.
The inter-system handover procedures are specified in the following sub-
clause. All messages concerned with inter-system handover are sent using the
connection oriented mode of the SCCP.
#### 3.1.5b.2 Inter-System Handover Resource Allocation
In the case of a handover from _Iu mode_ (GERAN or UTRAN) to _A/Gb mode_ , the
_Inter-System Information_ information element is used to pass Field Elements
from the new BSS to the old system. The information in the _Inter-System
Information_ information element is transparent for the MSC. When the _Inter-
System Information_ information element is present in the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message or the HANDOVER FAILURE message, the MSC may pass it to
the old system.
The new BSS may provide information about the traffic load of the target cell
by including the _Downlink Cell Load Information_ and/or the _Uplink Cell Load
Information_ field elements in the _Inter-System Information_ information
element. The old system may use the information to update the information
about the load on the new cell, which may be used in the initiation of future
cell load based handover procedures. This information shall represent the
traffic load in the cell assuming a successful completion of the handover
procedure in progress.
### 3.1.5c BSS Internal Handover with MSC support
This section is relevant only if an IP based user plane interface is
supported. The three internal handover procedures (Internal Handover
Preparation, Internal Handover Execution and Internal Handover Enquiry),
described in the following sections, use the existing SCCP connection.
#### 3.1.5c.1 Internal Handover Preparation
The details of the radio information as far as handover is concerned are given
in 3GPP TS 24.008.
When the BSS detects that e.g. a radio reason exists for an internal handover,
but a compatible Codec Type or Codec Configuration (see 3GPP TS 28.062) can
not be allocated in the target cell or the A-Interface Type has to be changed,
or the Redundancy Level on the A-Interface of an ongoing data or fax call has
to be changed or the Transport Layer Address has to be changed, then an
Internal Handover Preparation procedure is initiated by BSS.
This Internal Handover Preparation is initiated by generating an INTERNAL
HANDOVER REQUIRED message and sending it from the BSS to the MSC.
The INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED message contains the following information
elements:
\- Message Type.
\- Cause.
\- Cell Identifier (target cell)
\- Codec List (BSS Supported) (in target cell)
\- AoIP Transport Layer Address (target cell), if the BSS prefers an IP-based
target A-Interface Type
The \"Cause\" field indicates the reason for the INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED
message e.g. \"uplink quality poor\", \"Redundancy Level not adequate\"
indicated by BSS.
The \"Cell Identifier\" indicates a target cell controlled by the same BSS.
The target cell can be the same as the source cell.
The \"Codec List (BSS Supported)\" contains the up-to-date codec capabilities
in the target cell.
The \"AoIP Transport Layer Address\" contains the UDP/IP termination at the
BSS corresponding to the radio channel in the target cell. It is only
included, if the BSS prefers an IP-based target A-Interface Type. The new AoIP
Transport Layer Address may be identical to the old AoIP Transport Layer
Address.
The Internal Handover Preparation procedure terminates, if one of the
following conditions is met:
\- An INTERNAL HANDOVER COMMAND message is received from the MSC; or
\- A RESET message (or RESET CIRCUIT message or RESET IP RESOURCE message) is
received; or
\- An INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT is received; or
\- An ASSIGNMENT REQUEST is received; or
\- The Timer T25 expires without any answer from the MSC, or
\- All communication is lost with the MS as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018, and the
transaction is abandoned; or
\- The transaction ends, e.g. due to call clearing.
If the Internal Handover Execution procedure cannot be carried out, then the
MSC shall inform the BSS by sending an INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT
message.
To continue with the Internal Handover Execution procedure, the MSC generates
the INTERNAL HANDOVER COMMAND message as a response to the INTERNAL HANDOVER
REQUIRED message.
The Internal Handover Execution procedure can now proceed and this is given in
sub-clause 3.1.5c.2.
##### 3.1.5c.1.1 Internal Handover Required Reject
If the requested resource (e.g. Codec Type or Codec Configuration, A-Interface
Type, etc.) indicated in the INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED message is not
available, then an INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT message shall be returned
to the BSS. The appropriate failure cause will be included in the message
(Cause value: \"Requested Codec Type or Codec Configuration unavailable\",
\"Requested A-Interface Type unavailable\", \"Requested Codec Type or Codec
Configuration not supported\" or \"Requested A-Interface Type not supported\",
\"Requested Redundancy Level not supported\" or "Requested Redundancy Level
not available").
#### 3.1.5c.2 Internal Handover Execution
The Internal Handover Execution procedure in the context of the BSS/MSC
interface is the procedure whereby an MSC instructs an MS to tune to a new
dedicated radio resource or to a group of radio resources, which may be on a
different cell.
The MSC generates the INTERNAL HANDOVER COMMAND message as a response to the
INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED message. The INTERNAL HANDOVER COMMAND message
generated by the MSC shall contain the \"Speech Codec (MSC Chosen)\" and if an
IP based user plane A-Interface is chosen, also the \"AoIP Transport Layer
Address (MGW)\". The \"Speech Codec (MSC Chosen)\" shall contain one Codec
Type (or, in case of AMR-NB or AMR-WB, possibly more compatible Codec Types)
included in the \"Speech Codec List (BSS Supported)\" received in the INTERNAL
HANDOVER REQUIRED message, with one Codec Configuration (or the same or
compatible Codec Configuration(s) in case of more compatible Codec Types) and
with one A-Interface Type, that exactly correspond to the indication in the
\"Speech Codec List (BSS Supported)\".
If Local Call Local Switch (LCLS) is supported by the core network, the MSC
may include the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE in the INTERNAL HANDOVER
COMMAND message.
Upon reception of the INTERNAL HANDOVER COMMAND message, the BSS shall only
through-connect the two parties if either:
\- indicated to do so in the INTERNAL HANDOVER COMMAND message by receiving
the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to \"Connect\" and the other call
leg has previously received LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to
\"Connect\".
\- or the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE is not present in the INTERNAL
HANDOVER COMMAND message and the BSS previously in another BSSAP message
received the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to \"Connect\" for this
call leg and the other call leg has previously received LCLS-Connection-
Status-Control IE set to \"Connect\".
The BSS will construct and send the appropriate radio assignment or handover
messages, if required (i.e. if the radio resource(s) has/have to be changed),
as described in 3GPP TS 44.018. The INTERNAL HANDOVER COMMAND message includes
sufficient information to allow the BSS to construct the necessary layer 3
radio messages.
The radio interface HANDOVER COMMAND or ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is sent by
the BSS to the concerned MS, once the BSS has received the INTERNAL HANDOVER
COMMAND message and the remaining resources are allocated in the BSS.
When the MS accesses the radio resource(s) of the new channel with a HANDOVER
ACCESS burst, or anyway as soon as the main signalling link is established
then the BSS may send a HANDOVER DETECT message to the MSC.
When the MS is successfully in communication with the network, i.e. the RR
message HANDOVER COMPLETE or ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE has been received from the
MS, the BSS shall immediately send a HANDOVER COMPLETE message to the MSC and
terminate the procedure. Changes of the chosen encryption algorithm shall be
indicated in the HANDOVER COMPLETE message in case of an \"Internal Handover
Execution\" procedure, if the encryption algorithm has been changed by the
BSS. The Information Elements \"Speech Codec (Chosen)\" shall be included in
case of an \"Internal Handover Execution\" procedure. The Information Element
\"Codec List (BSS Supported)\" may be included in case of an \"Internal
Handover Execution\" procedure to indicate up-to-date BSS capabilities after
the handover.
If local switching is requested by the MSC, then the BSS shall inform the MSC
of the local switch establishment outcome by including the LCLS-BSS-Status IE
with the correct **LCLS connection status** value according to sub-clause
3.2.2.119 within the HANDOVER COMPLETE message. The BSS shall also notify the
MSC serving the other call leg if the LCLS connection status is changed for
this call leg, see sub-clause 3.1.33.5.
The sending of the HANDOVER COMPLETE message will implicitly release the old
dedicated resource(s) at the BSS and old resources in the MSC.
The Internal Handover Execution procedure shall not be interrupted by a
Handover Required message.
The relevant radio interface layer 3 procedures are described in 3GPP TS
24.008.
##### 3.1.5c.2.1 Internal Handover failure
The BSS may not be able to use the terrestrial resource (that is either a
terrestrial circuit or an IP based user plane interface) that the MSC has
indicated in the Internal Handover Command. In this case a BSSAP HANDOVER
FAILURE message will be returned with the Cause value set to: \"requested
terrestrial resource unavailable\".
If a radio interface HANDOVER FAILURE message is received from the MS on the
old channel, the BSS shall then send to the MSC the BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE
message. If the radio interface HANDOVER FAILURE message is the result of the
MS returning to the old channel after failing to establish on the new channel,
then the cause value \"radio interface failure, reversion to old channel\"
shall be included in the BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE message. Furthermore, it is
recommended that the air interface RR cause be included as well in this
message.
The BSSMAP HANDOVER FAILURE message from the BSS (with any cause value)
terminates the Internal Handover Execution procedure. The call between the MS
and the BSS and between the BSS and the MSC shall continue as if there had
been no handover attempt.
Further actions in the MSC or in the BSS concerning handover depend on the
handover algorithms which is operator dependent.
##### 3.1.5c.2.2 Abnormal Conditions
Whilst the Internal Handover Execution procedure is in operation, any other
messages received at the BSS relating to this connection and concerning
assignment, handover, or cipher mode control should be discarded.
Whilst the Internal Handover execution procedure is in operation the BSS
should not attempt to invoke any other procedure related to this call, e.g.
not send HANDOVER REQUIRED or INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED.
#### 3.1.5c.3 Internal Handover Enquiry
The MSC may trigger the \"Internal Handover Execution\" procedure to ensure
that the best fit of dedicated resource(s) (Codec Type, Codec Configuration,
Redundancy Level and A-Interface Type) are allocated to the ongoing call (e.g.
to re-establish TrFO). The decision in the MSC to trigger this procedure is
linked to implementation dependent strategies, based on the information
received from the MS and from the network.
The Internal Handover Preparation procedure is triggered by the MSC with the
transmission of an INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY message to the BSS.
The INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY message shall contain in the \"Speech Codec (MSC
Chosen)\" Information Element the details of the resource(s) (Codec Type,
Codec Configuration and Interface Type) preferred by the MSC. The BSS shall
use the information provided in the \"Speech Codec (MSC Chosen)\" Information
Element to decide a possible target cell that meets such indications.
NOTE: The target cell can be the cell where the voice call is ongoing.
Upon reception of the INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY message, if the BSS finds an
appropriate target cell that meets the needed radio requirements and is
compatible with the preferences in the \"Speech Codec (MSC Chosen)\"
Information Element, the BSS shall initiate the Internal Handover Preparation
procedure by sending the INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED message as described in
sub-clause 3.1.5c.1, with Cause \"Response to an INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY
message\".
The BSS may respond to an INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY message with an HANDOVER
FAILURE message with cause value \"INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY reject\". For
example the BSS cannot find an appropriate target cell that meets the needed
radio requirements and is compatible with the preferences in the \"Speech
Codec (MSC Chosen)\" Information Element contained in the INTERNAL HANDOVER
ENQUIRY message.
### 3.1.6 Internal Intra-Cell Handover Procedure
The definition of internal intra cell handover is given in sub-clause 5.
It is optional that a BSS support internal intra-cell handover. However if it
is supported, it should be as follows:
It should be possible to inhibit internal intra-cell handover at an BSS that
supports it by operation and maintenance command.
Internal intra-cell handover occurs between channels on the same cell. It is
decided and executed autonomously by the BSS, so that no message is generated
at the BSS-MSC interface, until the completion of the handover execution, when
the BSS sends a HANDOVER PERFORMED message over the SCCP and terrestrial
resources that are presently assigned to that call. Changes in type of
resources (for instance channel rate change, speech version change, ciphering
algorithm change) are indicated in the HANDOVER PERFORMED message.
If an IP based user plane A-interface is supported and compressed speech over
IP is in use, then the BSS shall not perform any autonomous \"internal intra-
cell handover\" procedure with a change of Codec Type or Codec Configuration
or Redundancy Level to an incompatible one. When the speech transcoder
resources are not allocated within the BSS or the Redundancy Level or the
A-Interface Type has to be changed, then the BSS shall use the \"BSS Internal
Handover\" Procedure. The decision process in the BSS is based on the
internally available radio and resource parameters taking into account the
previously received information from the MSC in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST or
HANDOVER REQUEST.
The relevant radio interface layer 3 procedures (dedicated channel assignment)
are described in 3GPP TS 24.008.
In the case of group calls the BSS may perform an intra-cell handover for a
talker from a dedicated channel to a group call channel, in this case the
HANDOVER PERFORMED message is sent by the BSS over the SCCP connection that
was previously assigned to the talker, followed by a CLEAR REQUEST with the
cause \"Joined group call channel\", the MSC shall release the dedicated A
interface resources.
In the case of group calls the BSS may perform an Intra-cell handover for a
talker from a Group call channel to a dedicated channel, in this case the BSS
performs external handover.
If local switching was requested by the MSC before the initiation of the
internal intra-cell handover procedure, then the BSS shall maintain local
switching on the new channel according to the most recently received LCLS-
Configuration IE and (if received) LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE and
inform the MSC of the local switch outcome by including the LCLS-BSS-Status IE
with the correct **LCLS connection status** value according to sub-clause
3.2.2.119 within the HANDOVER PERFORMED message. The BSS shall also notify the
MSC serving the other call leg if the LCLS connection status is changed for
this call leg, see sub-clause 3.1.33.5.
### 3.1.7 Internal Inter-Cell Handover Procedure
The definition of internal inter-cell handover is given in sub-clause 5.
It should be possible to inhibit internal inter-cell handover at a BSS that
supports it by operation and maintenance command.
Multi cell BSSs would normally be expected to support internal inter-cell
handover, however it is optional that they do so. However if it is supported,
it should be as follows:
Internal inter-cell handover occurs between channels pertaining to different
cells of the same BSS. It is decided and executed autonomously by the BSS, so
that no message is generated at the BSS-MSC interface, until the completion of
the handover execution, when the BSS sends a HANDOVER PERFORMED message over
the SCCP and terrestrial resources that are presently assigned to that call.
Changes in type of resources (for instance channel rate change, speech version
change, ciphering algorithm change) are indicated in the HANDOVER PERFORMED
message.
If an IP based user plane A-interface is supported and compressed speech over
IP is in use, then the BSS shall not perform any autonomous \"Internal inter-
cell handover\" procedure with a change of Codec Type or Codec Configuration
or Redundancy Level to an incompatible one. When the speech transcoder
resources are not allocated within the BSS or the Interface Type has to be
changed, then the BSS shall use the \"BSS Internal Handover\" procedure.
A special case of internal handover occurs when the handover is triggered by
the assignment procedure, e.g. directed retry. In this case the HANDOVER
PERFORMED message need not be sent as the equivalent response is provided by
the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message.
The decision process in the BSS is based on the internally available radio and
resource parameters taking into account the previously received information
from the MSC in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST or HANDOVER REQUEST.
The relevant radio interface layer 3 procedures (for handover) are described
in 3GPP TS 24.008.
Internal inter-cell handover for group calls may be performed from either
dedicated to dedicated channels, or dedicated to group call channels, or group
call to group call channels.
In the case of group calls, the BSS may perform an internal inter-cell
handover for a talker from a dedicated channel to a Group call channel, in
this case the HANDOVER PERFORMED message is sent by the BSS over the SCCP
connection that was previously assigned to the talker. The BSS will send a
CLEAR REQUEST with the cause \"Joined group call channel\".
In the case of group calls, the BSS may perform an internal inter-cell
handover for a talker from a group call channel to a Group call channel, in
this case the HANDOVER PERFORMED message is sent by the BSS over the SCCP
connection that was previously assigned to the talker.
In the case of internal inter-cell handover the BSS, when localised service
area is supported, will indicate the LSA identity of the target cell in the
HANDOVER PERFORMED message if it corresponds to one of the LSA identities
received in the latest LSA INFORMATION or the HANDOVER REQUEST messages.
If local switching was requested by the MSC before the initiation of the
internal inter-cell handover procedure, then the BSS shall maintain local
switching on the new channel according to the most recently received LCLS-
Configuration IE and (if received) LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE and
inform the MSC of the local switch outcome by including the LCLS-BSS-Status IE
with the correct **LCLS connection status** value according to sub-clause
3.2.2.119 within the HANDOVER PERFORMED message. The BSS shall also notify the
MSC serving the other call leg if the LCLS connection status is changed for
this call leg, see sub-clause 3.1.33.5.
### 3.1.8 Handover Candidate Enquiry
The purpose of this procedure is to allow the MSC to ascertain if it is
possible to handover any MSs that are currently being served by a particular
cell to another nominated cell. The procedure uses both global and dedicated
resource messages, and is relevant to an individual cell.
The algorithm in which a MSC decides on starting a handover enquiry procedure
is operator dependent.
#### 3.1.8.1 Successful Operation
The procedure operates as follows:
The MSC sends a HANDOVER CANDIDATE ENQUIRE message to a BSS. The message
indicates that the MSC wishes the BSS to identify handover candidates in a
particular cell, that can be handed over to other nominated cells. The maximum
number of candidates is also indicated to the BSS.
For each selected MS candidate the BSS will send to MSC a single, once only,
HANDOVER REQUIRED message (not guarded by timer T7), over each of the
appropriate SCCP connections. If the BSS was already generating HANDOVER
REQUIRED messages for a selected MS then the BSS will continue to do so.
However the Cause IE of the next HANDOVER REQUIRED message (at the expiry of
timer T7) will be set to \"Response to MSC invocation\" to indicate that the
message is generated in response to a HANDOVER CANDIDATE ENQUIRE message. But
as this HANDOVER REQUIRED was already being generated before the handover
enquiry procedure was started, that HANDOVER REQUIRED would be guarded by
timer T7. So in the instance of next expiry of timer T7, the BSS shall
continue sending HANDOVER REQUIRED message but the Cause IE value shall revert
back to the original Cause IE value.
When the last HANDOVER REQUIRED message has been sent for all the selected MS
candidates, the BSS returns to the MSC a HANDOVER CANDIDATE RESPONSE message
giving the number of candidates identified, and terminating the handover
enquiry procedure.
Only one handover enquiry procedure may be invoked on any given cell at any
one time.
#### 3.1.8.2 Abnormal conditions
If at the BSS a HANDOVER CANDIDATE ENQUIRE message is received when a handover
enquiry procedure has already been invoked then the new HANDOVER CANDIDATE
ENQUIRE message shall be discarded.
### 3.1.9 Release of Radio Resource And Terrestrial Resource
#### 3.1.9.1 Release Due To Transaction Completion
NOTE: This sub-clause does not apply to group call channels and their related
terrestrial resources. For the release of these resources due to the
completion of a VGCS/VBS call, see sub-clause 3.1.9.1a.
For a dedicated connection, the release of assigned radio resources at the end
of a transaction will take place as follows:
Release negotiation will take place directly between the MS and MSC using
transparent messages via the DTAP in the BSS (see 3GPP TS 24.008). The MSC
will then send a BSSMAP CLEAR COMMAND, indicating that the radio resource(s)
should be released. After the BSSMAP CLEAR COMMAND has been sent, the MSC
shall not send further BSSAP connection oriented messages on this particular
connection, except CLEAR COMMAND.
When BSC receives a BSSMAP CLEAR COMMAND message at the reroute procedure, see
sub-clause 3.1.32, following the reception of the REROUTE COMMAND message from
the MSC which is not the last attempted, no radio resources are released.
If the BSS allocates the A interface circuits, the MSC shall release the
circuit allocated to the connection, if any, before sending the CLEAR COMMAND.
When the BSS receives the CLEAR COMMAND:
\- the guard timer defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 is started and clearing on the
radio interface initiated.
\- the BSS marks any assigned terrestrial resources as idle and returns a
CLEAR COMPLETE message to the MSC. (The BSS need not wait for the radio
channel release to be completed or for the guard timer to expire before
returning the CLEAR COMPLETE message.)
\- the BSS marks any assigned terrestrial resources as idle and returns a
CLEAR COMPLETE message to the MSC. (The BSS need not wait for the radio
channel release to be completed or for the guard timer to expire before
returning the CLEAR COMPLETE message.)
During the release of an RR connection the MSC should indicate to the BSS
whether the RR connection was established as a result of CS fallback if such
knowledge is available in the MSC.
If the MSC allocates A interface circuits, on receipt of CLEAR COMPLETE, the
MSC releases any assigned terrestrial resources.
#### 3.1.9.1a Release of radio resources and the terrestrial resources for
VGCS/VBS calls:
When a VGCS/VBS call is to be released, the MSC shall send a BSSMAP CLEAR
COMMAND message via each VGCS/VBS Resource Controlling SCCP connection to the
BSS.
When the BSS receives the CLEAR COMMAND on a VGCS/VBS resource controlling
SCCP connection, the guard timer defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 is started and
clearing on the radio interface initiated. The BSS returns a CLEAR COMPLETE
message to the MSC. (The BSS need not wait for the radio channel release to be
completed or for the guard timer to expire before returning the CLEAR COMPLETE
message.) If A-interface circuit sharing is used, the BSS marks the assigned
terrestrial resources as idle only after it has sent a CLEAR COMPLETE message
on each resource controlling SCCP connection associated with the call.
When all terrestrial resources associated with the VGCS/VBS resource
controlling SCCP connections towards a particular BSS have been released, the
MSC shall send the BSSMAP CLEAR COMMAND message via the VGCS/VBS Call
Controlling SCCP connection to the BSS to release the associated call
controlling resources. When the BSS receives the CLEAR COMMAND it shall
releases the associated resources, it shall mark them as idle and return a
CLEAR COMPLETE message to the MSC.
After sending a BSSMAP CLEAR COMMAND on an SCCP connection, the MSC shall not
send further BSSAP connection oriented messages on that connection except
CLEAR COMMAND messages.
If the BSS allocates the A interface circuits, the MSC shall release the
circuit allocation to the connection, if any, before sending the CLEAR
COMMAND.
If the MSC allocates A-interface circuits, the MSC releases the circuit
allocation to the connection on receipt of a CLEAR COMPLETE message.
#### 3.1.9.2 Release due to BSS generated reason
If a radio channel release for a radio resource that is not related to a voice
group or broadcast call is required because of a BSS generated reason (e.g.
\"O and M intervention\", \"equipment failure\"), then the BSS shall generate
a CLEAR REQUEST message towards the MSC. This message shall include a Cause
Information Element, indicating the reason for the failure.
If transmission from the non VGCS/VBS MS is lost then a CLEAR REQUEST message
shall be sent to the MSC.
On receipt of a CLEAR REQUEST for a dedicated resource the MSC shall initiate
the release, as defined above, by sending a CLEAR COMMAND message. On receipt
of the CLEAR COMMAND the related radio resources shall be released by the BSC.
The procedure is always terminated with a CLEAR COMPLETE to the MSC.
If the release of a radio resource that is associated with a voice group or
broadcast call is required due to a BSS generated reason other than due to
loss of contact of the VGCS talker or VBS originator, and the network does not
support either group call re-establishment by the BSS or A-interface link
sharing, then
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the group channel in a cell
other then that of the current VCGS talker or that of the VBS originator, the
BSS shall send a CLEAR REQUEST message to the MSC indicating the reason for
the failure.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the group channel in the
cell of the VGCS talker which is on a dedicated channel or in the cell of the
VBS originator, the BSS shall send a CLEAR REQUEST message to the MSC
indicating the reason for the failure.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the current VCGS talker
which is on a dedicated channel, BSS shall send an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION
message to the MSC indicating the reason for the failure. On receipt of an
UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION message with a cause value other than \"Call
control\" or \"Radio interface failure\", the MSC shall initiate the release
of the radio and terrestrial resources by sending a CLEAR COMMAND message on
the dedicated SCCP connection.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the current VCGS talker
which is on a group channel, the BSS shall send an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION
message to the MSC indicating the reason for the failure. On receipt of an
UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION message with a cause value other than \"Call
control\" or \"Radio interface failure\", the MSC shall initiate the release
of the radio and terrestrial resources by sending a CLEAR COMMAND message on
the VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP connection.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the VBS originator, the BSS
shall send a CLEAR REQUEST message to the MSC indicating the reason for the
failure. On receipt of a CLEAR REQUEST message the MSC shall initiate clearing
of the broadcast call.
If a radio channel release of the radio resource that is associated to a voice
group or broadcast call is required due to a BSS generated reason other than
due to loss of contact of the VGCS talker or VBS originator, and the network
supports group call re-establishment by the BSS or A-interface link sharing,
then:
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the group channel in a cell
other then that of the current VCGS talker or that of the VBS originator, the
BSS shall send a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message to the MSC indicating cell
released for the group call, and then releases the radio resource. If
A-interface link sharing is being used the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message
is sent after expiry of timer Tast.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the group channel in the
cell of the VGCS talker which is on a dedicated channel or in the cell of the
VBS originator, the BSS shall send a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message to the
MSC indicating cell released for the group call, and then releases the radio
resource. If A-interface link sharing is being used the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
STATUS message is sent after expiry of timer Tast.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the current VCGS talker
which is on a dedicated channel, the BSS shall send an UPLINK RELEASE
INDICATION message to the MSC indicating the reason for the failure. On
receipt of an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION message with a cause value other than
\"Call control\" or \"Radio interface failure\", the MSC shall initiate the
release of the radio and terrestrial resources by sending a CLEAR COMMAND
message on the dedicated SCCP connection.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the current VCGS talker
which is on a group channel, the BSS shall send an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION
message with an appropriate cause value. The BSS shall also send a VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT STATUS message to the MSC indicating cell released for the voice
group or broadcast call, and then release the radio resource for the group
channel. When A-interface link sharing is being used the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
STATUS message is sent after expiry of timer Tast.
\- if the radio resource to be released is that of the VBS originator, the BSS
shall send a CLEAR REQUEST message to the MSC indicating the reason for the
failure. On receipt of a CLEAR REQUEST message the MSC shall initiate clearing
of the broadcast call.
On receipt of a CLEAR REQUEST on the VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP
connection, the MSC shall initiate the release, as defined above, by sending a
CLEAR COMMAND message. On receipt of the CLEAR COMMAND the radio resources
related to this cell shall be released by the BSS. If the terrestrial resource
is not configured for A-interface circuit sharing then the resource shall be
released by the MSC or marked as idle by the BSS. For the case that the
terrestrial resource is configured for A-interface circuit sharing then it
will only be released by the MSC or marked as idle by the BSS if there are no
other VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP connections that are sharing this
resource. The resource controlling SCCP connection for the cell shall be
released. The procedure is always terminated with a CLEAR COMPLETE to the MSC.
If transmission from a VGCS talker that was on the group call channel is lost
then the BSS shall indicate the uplink being released by sending an UPLINK
RELEASE INDICATION message with cause value \"Radio interface failure\". the
MSC shall not start the clearing sequence, and the resources at the BSS are
not released.
If transmission from a VGCS talker that was on a dedicated channel is lost,
then the BSS shall indicate the uplink being released by sending an UPLINK
RELEASE INDICATION message with cause value \"Radio interface failure\". The
MSC shall initiate the release of the resources associated with the talker by
sending a CLEAR COMMAND message, as described above.
If transmission from a VBS originator is lost then the BSS shall send a CLEAR
REQUEST message with cause value \"Radio interface failure\". On receipt of a
CLEAR REQUEST message the MSC shall initiate clearing of the broadcast call.
In the case of a group call talker the BSS may move the mobile on to a group
call channel, in this case the BSS shall initiate a release of A interface
resources by sending a CLEAR REQUEST with the cause \"Joined group call
channel\". The MSC in its turn shall release the dedicated resources
associated with the talker.
If the BSS sends a CLEAR REQUEST with the cause different than \"Joined group
call channel\" for resources associated with the uplink, then the MSC shall
assume uplink indicated as released.
#### 3.1.9.3 Release due to successful handover
If a radio channel release is required because of a handover being
successfully completed on another BSS, then the resources at the old BSS are
released by the MSC using the clearing sequence with cause value \"handover
successful\".
In the case of handover of a group call talker from a group call channel the
MSC shall send a HANDOVER SUCCEEDED message to the old BSS.
#### 3.1.9.4 Release due to uplink release
If a talker on dedicated connection releases its uplink the BSS shall inform
the MSC by an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION message with cause value \"Call
control\". Then the resources at the BSS are released by the MSC using the
clearing sequence. The BSS is allowed to release the radio resources before
the MSC initiates the clearing procedure.
If a talker on group call channel releases its uplink, the BSS shall inform
the MSC by an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION message with cause value \"Call
control\". In this case the MSC shall not start the clearing sequence, and the
resources at the BSS are not released. The BSS shall initiate the radio
interface uplink free procedure.
### 3.1.10 Paging
PAGING messages for all MSs shall be sent via the BSSMAP as a connectionless
message. These will include the IMSI of the MS to allow derivation of the
paging population number; they may also include an indication of which
combination of channels will be needed for the subsequent transaction related
to the paging. This type of PAGING message will then be stored and a
corresponding radio interface paging message transmitted over the radio
interface at the appropriate time.
It should be noted that each PAGING message on the MSC-BSS interface relates
to only one MS and therefore the BSS has to pack the pages into the relevant
3GPP TS 24.008 radio interface paging message.
If a radio interface PAGING RESPONSE message is received then the relevant
connection is set up towards the MSC as described in 3GPP TS 48.002 and the
radio interface PAGING RESPONSE message is passed to the MSC in a COMPLETE
LAYER 3 INFORMATION message.
If an IP based user plane interface is supported the COMPLETE LAYER 3
INFORMATION message shall contain the Information Element \"Codec List (BSS
Supported)\".
A single PAGING message across the MSC to BSS interface contains information
on the cells in which the page shall be broadcast.
If the VGCS/VBS flag is set to zero, this indicates that the mobile station to
be paged is not a member of any VGCS/VBS group and it is thus not necessary to
perform in band paging for this mobile station over the FACCH channel for any
VGCS/VBS group.
If the mobile station is a member of at least one VBS/VGCS group, then the MSC
shall indicate the paging cause in the Paging Information IE and shall include
this IE in the PAGING message.
### 3.1.11 Trace Invocation
The purpose of the trace invocation procedure is to inform the receiving
entity that it should begin producing a trace record on this particular
transaction.
The trace is invoked either by the MSC sending a MSC INVOKE TRACE message to
the BSS or by the BSS sending a BSS INVOKE TRACE message.
The events and parameters to be recorded are indicated in the \"Trace type\"
information element.
A \"Forwarding indicator\" element may be used in the BSS INVOKE TRACE to
indicate if the trace is to be continued after handover to another BSS. If
thus indicated, The MSC should forward the BSS INVOKE TRACE to the BSS-B and
also store it to send to any subsequent BSS during the lifetime of the call.
The remaining elements, when received, are to be passed transparently to the
OMC receiving the trace record.
The element \"OMCId\", if present, indicates the OMC to which the record is
destined.
In sending the BSS INVOKE TRACE message, the BSS may allocate and include a
\"BSS transaction reference\". Similarly in the MSC INVOKE TRACE message, the
MSC may allocate and include an \"MSC transaction reference\" (typically a
call reference). The transaction reference is contained in the information
element \"TransactionId\".
The message includes a trace reference which is allocated by the entity which
triggered the trace.
The element \"TriggerId\", if present, indicates the entity which triggered
the trace.
The trace reference, triggerId and transactionId Information Elements are used
to tag the trace record to allow simpler construction of the total record by
the entity which combines trace records.
The messages are not acknowledged and are sent as a connection oriented
message on the connection on which a trace is required.
### 3.1.12 Flow Control
These procedures are defined to give some degree of flow control. At the BSS
processor overload and CCCH scheduler overload are catered for, and at the MSC
processor overload is catered for.
#### 3.1.12.1 Philosophy
The philosophy used is to stem the traffic at source with known effect on the
service. The algorithm used is:
\- On receipt of the first OVERLOAD message or signalling point congested
information, the traffic is reduced by one step. At the same time, timers T5
(T17) and T6 (T18) are started. During T5 (T17) all received overload messages
or signalling point congested information are ignored in order not to reduce
the traffic too rapidly. Reception of an OVERLOAD message or signalling point
congested information after expiry of T5 (T17) but still during T6 (T18) ,
will decrease the traffic load by one more step, and restart T5 (T17) and T6
(T18).
\- This step by step reduction of traffic is continued until maximum reduction
is obtained by arriving at the last step. If T6 (T18) expires (i.e. no
OVERLOAD message or signalling point congested information is received during
T6 (T18)) the traffic will be increased by one step and T6 (T18) will be
started, unless full load has been resumed.
NOTE: Timers T5 and T6 are running in the MSC whilst Timers T17 and T18 are
running in the BSS.
\- The number of steps and the method of reducing the load is considered to be
an implementation specific function.
There may be other traffic control mechanisms from O and M activities
occurring simultaneously.
#### 3.1.12.2 Processor Overload at the MSC
The MSC can indicate to the BSS that it is in a congested state by sending an
OVERLOAD message. This is sent as a connectionless global message.
At the BSS receipt of this message causes the reduction of random access
traffic using the method described in sub-clause 3.1.12.1.
For example, the amount of random access traffic could be reduced by using the
access control class in the system information message of 3GPP TS 24.008.
#### 3.1.12.3 Processor/CCCH overload at the BSS
If the CCCH scheduler at the BSS is overloaded (queue passed a predefined
threshold) then the BSS sends an OVERLOAD message to the MSC (or, if the
network supports \"Intra domain connection of RAN nodes to multiple CN nodes\"
(see 3GPP TS 23.236 [48]) to the appropriate MSCs) with the appropriate cause
(Cause value: \"CCCH overload\") and indicating the cell in question.
If the BSS processing is overloaded then the BSS sends an OVERLOAD message
with the Cause value: \"processor overload\".
The MSC originated traffic is reduced in accordance with the method described
in sub-clause 3.1.12.1.
#### 3.1.12.4 Message throughput congestion
If the lower layers of the protocol become congested then it is assumed that
the MTP congestion indication will take place (see 3GPP TS 48.002) and the
source of the traffic will receive primitives from the transport protocols
resulting in it reducing the generated load.
A suitable method to achieve this reduction could be based on that given in
sub-clause 3.1.12.1.
### 3.1.13 Classmark Handling Procedures
#### 3.1.13.1 Classmark request procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to allow the MSC to trigger a classmark
updating procedure. This is done by sending a CLASSMARK REQUEST message to the
BSS on the appropriate SCCP connection. When receiving this message the BSS
shall initiate the appropriate actions on the radio path.
#### 3.1.13.2 Classmark updating procedure
The purpose of the classmark updating procedure is to inform the receiving
entity about classmark information received from the MS.
At any point when an SCCP connection has been established for BSSAP messages,
the BSS must be able to send to the MSC a CLASSMARK UPDATE message if a
classmark update is received from the MS. This message contains information on
several transmission parameters relevant to the MS in communication with the
network.
If the MSC has already initiated a handover for the concerned MS by sending a
HANDOVER REQUEST message when the CLASSMARK UPDATE message is received, the
MSC shall send a CLASSMARK UPDATE message to the target BSS when the MS is
successfully in communication with the network on the new (main) channel. If
this CLASSMARK UPDATE message is received in the target BSS after a new
classmark has been received from the Mobile Station the CLASSMARK UPDATE
message from the MSC shall be ignored.
This message is sent as a BSSAP message over the appropriate SCCP connection.
This procedure will be used where the power class of the MS changes or if the
network requests the MS to send the classmark information whilst the MS has
one or more dedicated resources.
The procedure will also be used to send classmark information to the MSC if
the MS immediately after initial L3 message sends additional classmark
information. In this case the BSS may as an option suppress or delay the
sending of the CLASSMARK UPDATE message to the MSC.
### 3.1.14 Cipher Mode Control
#### 3.1.14.1 Successful Operation
The cipher mode control procedure allows the MSC to pass cipher mode
information to the BSS to select and load the user data and signalling
encryption device with the appropriate key.
This is achieved by sending the BSS a CIPHER MODE COMMAND message. Receipt of
the message at the BSS will cause the generation of a radio interface
CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message and, if applicable, invoke the encryption
device and start stream ciphering as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 and 3GPP TS
43.020.
If within the CIPHER MODE COMMAND, the signalling element \"Cipher response
mode\" is present and indicates \"IMEI must be included by the Mobile
Station\", then the BSS shall request in the radio interface message CIPHERING
MODE COMMAND the Mobile Station to include its IMEI in the radio interface
CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message (see 3GPP TS 24.008).
In the CIPHER MODE COMMAND the MSC specifies which of the ciphering algorithms
may be used by the BSS. The BSS then selects an appropriate algorithm, taking
into account the MS ciphering capabilities. The CIPHER MODE COMPLETE message
returned to the MSC indicates the chosen ciphering algorithm. The set of
permitted ciphering algorithms specified in the CIPHER MODE COMMAND shall
remain applicable for subsequent Assignments and Intra-BSS Handovers.
The CIPHER MODE COMMAND and CIPHER MODE COMPLETE messages are sent as
connection oriented messages via the appropriate SCCP connection.
Receipt of the radio interface CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message (or other
correctly deciphered layer 2 frame) from the radio interface is used
internally within the BSS to achieve radio interface ciphering synchronisation
(see 3GPP TS 24.008). When the BSS receives the radio interface CIPHERING MODE
COMPLETE from the MS a CIPHER MODE COMPLETE message is returned to the MSC. If
the CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message received on the radio interface contained
more than two octets, then the BSS shall include in the BSSMAP CIPHER MODE
COMPLETE message a \"Layer 3 message contents\" signalling element containing
octets 3 up to n (where n is the length of that CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE radio
interface message) of that radio interface CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message.
#### 3.1.14.2 Abnormal Conditions
If the BSS is unable to support the ciphering algorithm specified in the
CIPHER MODE COMMAND message then it shall return a CIPHER MODE REJECT message
with Cause value \"Ciphering algorithm not supported\". A CIPHER MODE REJECT
message shall also be returned if the MSC requests a change of ciphering
algorithm when ciphering is already active.
### 3.1.15 General SCCP Abnormal Conditions
If a user-out-of-service information or signalling-point-inaccessible
information is received by the BSSAP or BSSOMAP no new attempt to establish
SCCP connections towards the affected point code will be started until the
corresponding user-in-service information or signalling-point-accessible
information is received.
When a user-out-of-service information or signalling-point-inaccessible is
received by the BSS an optional timer may be started. When the timer expires
all the SCCP connections towards the affected point code will be released.
When the user-in-service or signalling-point-accessible is received, the timer
is stopped.
If for any reason an SCCP connection is released, the optional timer expires
or a connection refusal is received while any of the BSSAP procedures are
being performed or while a dedicated resource is still allocated the following
actions are taken:
**At BSS:**
The radio resources associated with the SCCP connection are cleared by an
appropriate radio procedure.
Any BSS procedure relating to that connection is abandoned.
The resources allocated to the call associated to the connection are released.
**At MSC:**
The call associated with the SCCP connection is cleared as soon as possible.
At the BSS, communication over assigned radio channels shall be assumed to be
continuing until either the SCCP connection is lost, a clearing sequence is
received, or no signal is received from an MS for longer than the guard time
defined in 3GPP TS 24.008. If the BSS recognises that a call has terminated
then a CLEAR REQUEST message should be generated.
If a 2Mbit/s system fails and one of the standard alarms is received, no
action is taken at the BSS on the calls associated with the traffic channels
involved.
At the MSC, calls or VGCS talker dedicated connection and associated uplink or
ressource controlling connection should be cleared if either subscriber
clears, or if the BSS sends a CLEAR REQUEST message. Clearing of affected
calls by the MSC may take place after loss of the traffic channels for a
period defined by the operator.
For the procedures controlled by the MSC, and in particular procedures where
the MSC sends a request for resources at the BSS and waits for an acknowledge,
the implementation in the MSC must provide means for avoiding deadlock
situations at the BSS as e.g. hanging resources.
### 3.1.16 Initial MS message
When the SCCP connection establishment is performed by the BSS, the radio
interface initial L3 message received from the MS (piggybacked on the SABM
frame) is processed as follows:
The BSS shall analyse the protocol discriminator of the message.
If the BSS does not support the protocol, reactions of the BSS are specified
in 3GPP TS 44.018. If the BSS supports the protocol, it shall analyse the
message to a level which allows the extraction by the BSS of the Classmark
information and, if the network supports \"Intra domain connection of RAN
nodes to multiple CN nodes\", the Mobile Identity (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [48]).
However, except for the NOTIFICATION RESPONSE, the entire radio interface
initial L3 message (e.g. CM SERVICE REQUEST, PAGING RESPONSE, CM
REESTABLISHMENT REQUEST, LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, IMSI DETACH, IMMEDIATE
SETUP) is also passed to the MSC, using a COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION
message. The BSS does not analyse the contents of the initial layer 3 message,
other than the Classmark information and, if the network supports \"Intra
domain connection of RAN nodes to multiple CN nodes\", the Mobile Identity. If
an IP based user plane interface is supported, the COMPLETE LAYER 3
INFORMATION message shall include the Information Element \"Codec List (BSS
Supported)\".
If an IP based user plane interface is supported, the BSS shall predict to its
best possible knowledge, which Codec Types, Codec Configurations, A-Interface
Types and transcoder resources in the BSS could be used at this point in time.
The BSS shall only include elements within the Codec List (BSS Supported) that
are currently available.
The BSS may also give the MSC a description of the channel on which the
initial layer 3 message was received.
When network sharing is in use in a cell, the initial Layer 3 message has to
be managed as follows:
\- In the case of LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST and for a PLMN index indicator
equal to zero (which corresponds to a mobile station non supporting network
sharing): the rerouting procedure shall be applied, as described in sub-clause
3.1.32.
\- In the case of LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, CM SERVICE REQUEST, PAGING
RESPONSE and for a PLMN index indicator different from zero (which corresponds
to a mobile station supporting network sharing): the BSS shall include the
selected PLMN ID within the COMPLETE LAYER3 INFORMATION message, as described
within sub-clause 3.2.1.32. In such a case the selected PLMN ID shall be
derived by the BSS from the PLMN index indicator provided within the initial
Layer3 message as described within 3GPP TS 24.008 [6].
### 3.1.17 Queuing Indication
The purpose of the QUEUING INDICATION message is t inform the MSC about a
delay in the allocation of the necessary dedicated radio resources. The
procedure is only relevant if the system is using a queuing procedure for
traffic channels in the BSS, (sub-clause 3.1.17.1) and/or for handover of
traffic channels (sub-clause 3.1.17.2).
#### 3.1.17.1 Operation of the procedure in case of assignment procedure
After the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message without having the necessary TCH
available the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message shall be put into a queue; the
QUEUING INDICATION message shall be returned to the MSC and the timer T11
shall be started. The timer value T11 specifies the maximum queuing delay and
is determined by the operator.
The procedure shall be terminated with a successful or unsuccessful assignment
of the required traffic channel(s) by sending an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE or an
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message, respectively, to the MSC.
If the timer T11 expires the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message shall be removed from
the queue and a CLEAR REQUEST message shall be sent to the MSC, with the Cause
\"no radio resource available\".
#### 3.1.17.2 Operation of the procedure in case of hand-over resource
allocation procedure
After the HANDOVER REQUEST message without having the necessary TCH available
the HANDOVER REQUEST shall be put into a queue; the QUEUING INDICATION message
shall be returned to the MSC and the timer Tqho shall be started. The timer
value Tqho specifies the maximum queuing delay and is determined by the
operator.
The procedure shall be terminated with a successful or unsuccessful
reservation of the required traffic channel(s) by sending a HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE or a HANDOVER FAILURE message, respectively, to the MSC.
If the timer Tqho expires the HANDOVER REQUEST shall be removed from the queue
and a HANDOVER FAILURE message shall be sent to the MSC with the Cause value
\"no radio resource available\".
### 3.1.18 Data Link Control SAPI not Equal to \"0\"
The radio interface can support data links with the SAPI not equal to \"0\".
#### 3.1.18.1 Data link set up across the radio interface
This sub-clause deals with the impact of data link establishment (SAPI not
equal to \"0\") on the MSC to BSS interface.
##### 3.1.18.1.1 MS to MSC direction
In the MS to MSC direction the receipt of a layer 3 message via a data link
where SAPI does not equal \"0\" at the BSS will be transferred to the MSC as a
DTAP message with the DLCI (Data Link Connection Identification) octet set
appropriately.
##### 3.1.18.1.2 MSC to MS Direction
Receipt of a layer 3 (DTAP) message from the MSC with the SAPI (indicated in
the DLCI) not equal to \"0\" will cause one of the following actions:
\- the triggering of a data link set up to support the message transfer across
the radio interface if no suitable link exists;
\- the transmission of the message to the MS if a suitable link has already
been established;
\- the sending of a BSSMAP SAPI \"N\" REJECT message to the MSC if for any
reason the data link cannot be established, A Cause Information Element is
included; typical Cause values are: \"O&M intervention\", \"processor
overload\", \"BSS not equipped\", \"MS not equipped\".
#### 3.1.18.2 Choice of the signalling link
When the BSS relays a message of the PDSS1 protocol received on the air
interface to the MSC, it shall indicate in the DLCI (see 3GPP TS 48.002) on
which control channel and SAPI the message was received.
When the MSC sends a DTAP message to the BSS, it shall:
\- if the protocol of the corresponding air interface layer 3 message is
PDSS1, specify on which control channel and SAPI of the air interface the L3
message shall be sent;
\- otherwise not further specify the control channel on the air interface.
When the BSS relays an air interface L3 message received in a DTAP message on
the A interface to the MS, it shall:
\- if the DLCI does not further specify the signalling channel of the air
interface, send it on the appropriate signalling link;
\- if the BSS supports PDSS1 and the DLCI specifies which control channel is
to be used for transmission on the air interface, the BSS shall transfer the
air interface L3 message on the specified control channel.
NOTE: If the BSS does not support PDSS1, it considers the part of the DLCI
possibly indicating the control channel to be used on the air interface as
spare bits, see 3GPP TS 48.002.
### 3.1.19 BSSMAP Error Handling
To allow for the introduction of new functions the following rules shall be
used to determine the actions of a receiving entity when it receives a
message, part or all of which it is unable to understand. As the recipient is
unable to tell the difference between a new, previously unspecified coding and
an erroneous coding, the recipient also uses the same rules for error
handling.
The robustness of a recipient in handling erroneous messages does not relax
the requirement that the transmitter shall obey the present document. However,
it is intended that functionality can be gradually added to an entity, and no
obstacle to intermediate phase equipment is intended.
With the exception of sub-clause 3.1.19.6, the specific \'abnormal case\'
handling in other sub-clauses of the present document take precedence over
this sub-clause.
#### 3.1.19.1 Definitions of Types of Information Elements
The following definitions shall be used in sub-clause 3.1.19 and only in this
sub-clause.
**Essential Elements**
These are the conditional elements when the condition for their reception is
fulfilled, plus the Mandatory elements excluding the Cause value information
element (sub-clause 3.2.2.5).
**Mandatory Elements**
These are the Information Elements marked as \'M\' in sub-clause 3.2.1.
**Non-Essential Elements**
Non-essential elements are all the information elements that are not defined
as essential.
**Conditional Elements**
In the indicated messages the following elements are conditional:
\- Circuit identity code in sub-clauses 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.8.
\- Circuit pool list in sub-clauses 3.2.1.3, 3.2.1.9, 3.2.1.16 and 3.2.1.55.
NOTE: A conditional IE is an IE whose presence or absence in a message can be
determined by information contained in the rest of the message.
**Transparent Elements**
The following elements are defined as transparent:
\- for the BSS: TMSI;\ \- RR cause;\ \- Layer 3 information in the BSSMAP
HANDOVER COMMAND message; and\ \- Layer 3 message contents; and for the MSC:
Resource situation.\ \- Layer 3 information in the BSSMAP HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message; and
\- \"Old BSS to new BSS information\" in the BSSMAP HANDOVER REQUIRED message;
\- \"Source RNC to target RNC transparent information (UMTS)\" in the BSSMAP
HANDOVER REQUIRED message;
\- \"Source RNC to target RNC transparent information (cdma2000)\" in the
BSSMAP HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
**Non-Transparent Elements**
Non-transparent elements are all the information elements that are not defined
as transparent.
#### 3.1.19.2 Erroneous Events
The following events shall be regarded as errors by the recipient:
\- a message whose type is non-existent, unrecognisable, not consistent with
the recipient\'s state, or, that is sent in the wrong direction. This includes
messages that should use the SCCP connectionless service but that are received
on an SCCP connection, and vice versa;
\- a missing essential information element;
\- use of a reserved codepoint in an information element that is both
essential and non-transparent; and
\- an essential and non-transparent information element which is too short
(the contents of any \'Length\' octet shall be used to determine the boundary
of the element).
When a recipient detects one or more of these events it shall return the
appropriate error message with a suitable Cause value and the message shall be
discarded.
#### 3.1.19.3 Non-erroneous Events
The following events shall not be regarded as errors by the recipient:
\- spare bits with an unexpected value in any information element;
\- the use of additional octets in any information element with a length
octet;
\- a missing non-essential information element;
\- use of reserved codepoints in any non-essential information element or in
any transparent information element; and
\- a non-essential information element or a transparent information element
whose length is too short.
When the recipient detects one or more of these events the receiving entity
shall ignore the information that it is unable to understand and treat the
message on the basis of the information that remains.
Additionally:
\- all information in a message that is received after the start of an
information element with an unrecognisable identifier shall be ignored. The
message shall be accepted or rejected solely on the basis of the information
received before the start of the unrecognisable element; and
\- when more information elements of a particular type are received than are
expected, the last one(s) shall be ignored.
#### 3.1.19.4 Other Events
The following events should be treated on a case by case basis and the outcome
may depend upon the capabilities of the recipient.
1 The recipient may accept messages that contain information elements that do
not appear to be in the correct sequence. Elements that occur more than once
in a message shall be assumed to have been transmitted in the correct order.
Recipients that do not accept out of sequence information elements shall
regard the message as containing unexpected and/or missing information
elements and follow the procedures of sub-clauses 3.1.19.1 and/or 3.1.19.2.
2 Where a field in an information element contains a value, which the
recipient knows to be incorrect, the recipient shall either reject the message
or it shall ignore that field, and treat the information that remains in the
message.
(e.g. if the \'Number of MSs\' in a Handover Candidate Response message is
greater than the number of Handover Required messages received).
#### 3.1.19.5 Appropriate Error Message and Cause Value
The choice of error message depends upon the received message type:
* * *
Received message type Error Message ASSIGNMENT REQUEST ASSIGNMENT FAILURE
HANDOVER REQUEST HANDOVER FAILURE HANDOVER REQUIRED:  
\- if \"Response Request\" i.e. is present HANDOVER REQUIRED REJECT \- if
\"Response Request\" i.e. is not present CONFUSION CIPHER MODE COMMAND CIPHER
MODE REJECT VGCS/VBS SETUP VGCS/VBS SETUP REFUSE VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE CONFUSION an error message shall not be used all
other message types CONFUSION
* * *
When a problem is experienced with a message sent over an SCCP connection, the
error message is returned over that connection. When a problem occurs in a
message sent using the SCCP connectionless service, the error message is
returned using the SCCP connectionless service.
To avoid overload of the A-interface, transmission of error messages may be
inhibited. (However, the transmission of Assignment Failure, Handover Failure,
Handover Required Reject and Cipher Mode Reject messages in the cases required
by sub-clauses 3.1.1, 3.1.5, 3.1.5a and 3.1.14 shall not be inhibited.) When
the transmission of error messages is inhibited, they shall be replaced by
some kind of notification to O&M. Several settings may be used to allow
various subsets of \'error events\' to trigger error messages while the
remaining events only lead to O&M notification.
The Error pointer in the Diagnostics information element should be used to
indicate the position of a detected error in the received message. Typical
Causes are:
* * *
Cause Usage
Invalid cell Indicated cell not controlled by the BSS or not reachable through
the MSC.\ May also be used for handover outside group call area.
Invalid message contents May be used in any error message.
Protocol error between BSS and MSC The received message is not consistent with
the receiver\'s state, or the message has been sent in the wrong direction, or
the message uses the wrong SCCP service (connection oriented instead of
connectionless or vice versa).
Information element or field missing Data missing from the area indicated by
the error pointer.
Incorrect value A field (that should be indicated by the error pointer)
contains an incorrect or incompatible value, or uses a reserved codepoint.
Unknown message type The received message was of an unknown type.
Unknown information element An information element identifier (that should be
indicated by the error pointer) contains an unknown value.
* * *
#### 3.1.19.6 Unequipped Circuit Identification Code
If a MSC or BSS receives a message indicating one or more circuit which are
unknown the following actions shall be taken:
\- If an ASSIGNMENT REQUEST, a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST or a HANDOVER
REQUEST message is received containing a circuit identity code which is
unknown to the BSS the appropriate failure message is returned to the MSC. In
addition the UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT message is sent to the MSC for the circuit
concerned.
\- If an ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE, a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT, a HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE or a CHANGE CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE Message is received containing a
circuit identity code which is unknown to the MSC, it is up to the MSC to
correct the situation, e.g. by performing a circuit re-selection procedure and
sending an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT Message to the BSS.
\- If a circuit supervision message (BLOCK, UNBLOCK or RESET CIRCUIT) is
received containing a circuit identity code which is not known no respective
acknowledgement is returned. Instead an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT Message is sent to
the peer entity for the circuit concerned.
\- If a circuit supervision acknowledgement message (BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE,
UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE or RESET CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE) is received containing a
circuit identity code which is not known, an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT message is
sent to the peer entity for the circuit concerned.
\- If a circuit group supervision message (GROUP BLOCK, GROUP UNBLOCK) is
received which affects one or more circuits which are unknown to the own
entity the returned acknowledgement message shall not contain any information
about these circuit(s), i.e. the respective status bit(s) in the status field
shall not be set. Instead an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT Message is sent to the peer
entity for the circuit(s) concerned.
\- If a circuit group supervision acknowledgement message (CIRCUIT GROUP
BLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE or CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING ACKNOWLEDGE) is received
which affects one or more circuits which are unknown to the own entity an
UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT message is sent to the peer entity for the circuit(s)
concerned.
\- If an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT Message is received indicating a circuit which is
unknown in the own entity no UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT Message will be returned.
If an UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT Message is received indicating a circuit(s) that is
known to the recipient, the indicated circuit(s) should be removed from
service and the situation should be reported to the maintenance system for
further intervention. The UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT message is not to be acknowledged
by the recipient.
#### 3.1.19.7 Field Elements
This sub-clause defines the generic error handling to be applied to the field
elements found in the _Old BSS to New BSS Information_ , _New BSS to Old BSS
Information_ and _Inter-System Information_ information elements.
All field elements shall be treated as non-essential.
The following events shall not be regarded as errors by the recipient:
\- spare bits with an unexpected value in any field element;
\- the use of additional octets in any field element;
\- a missing field element;
\- a field element whose length is either too short or too long.
When the recipient detects one or more of these events the receiving entity
shall ignore the information that it is unable to understand and treat the
message on the basis of the information that remains:
\- when an unknown field element identifier is encountered, the unknown field
element shall be skipped and the receiver shall continue processing any
remaining field elements;
\- when more field elements of a particular type are received than are
expected, the last one(s) shall be ignored;
\- when a sub-field in a field element contains a value, which the recipient
knows to be incorrect, the recipient shall either ignore that sub-field or
ignore the entire field (treating it as if the field element had not been
received); and
\- when a sub-field in a field element contains a reserved value, the
recipient shall ignore the entire field element (treating it as if the field
element had not been received).
### 3.1.20 Load Indication Procedure
The purpose of the load indication procedure is to inform all neighbour BSS\'s
about the traffic situation of a cell.
The philosophy is to control the incoming handover traffic at the source, i.e.
the BSS of the concerned cell informs all of its neighbour BSS\'s about the
load situation. This is achieved by sending a LOAD INDICATION message to the
neighbour BSS\'s. On receipt of the LOAD INDICATION message the BSS may
analyse the load information and take the traffic load into consideration when
deciding a handover.
The algorithm in which the BSS decides on starting a Load Indication procedure
is operator dependent.
The implementation of the Load Indication procedure shall be regarded as
optional, that means, if this procedure is not used, the Load Indication
message may be ignored by these network elements.
#### 3.1.20.1 Operation of the procedure
The procedure operates as follows:
The BSS shall send the LOAD INDICATION message to the MSC with the following
information:
\- Cell Identifier of the cell where the traffic load situation takes place
(Cell Identifier information element).
\- The Time indication information element contains the time where the traffic
load information shall be valid on the receiving side.
\- The Cell identifier list information element contains the cell identifier
of the affected neighbour cells.
\- The information about the total number of channels accessible or in use,
and the information about the current number of channels available for each
reported channel type on the indicated cell (Resource situation information
element).
\- The reason for sending this message (Cause information element).
On receipt of the LOAD INDICATION message, the MSC transmits this message to
all BSS\'s as derived from the Cell identifier list Information Element.
NOTE: In the case where more than one indicated cells in the cell identifier
list IE belong to the same BSS, the MSC should try to send the LOAD INDICATION
message only once to this BSS.
With each reception of a LOAD INDICATION message from the MSC the target BSS
shall analyse the resource information and adapt the handover traffic either
from all cells of the BSS-area or only from the cells contained in the Cell
identifier list Information Element to the cell indicated in the Cell
identifier Information Element. The BSS shall ignore all Cell identifiers for
cells which do not belong to its area.
In the case where the BSS receives a LOAD INDICATION message without the
Resource situation information element, that means the indicated cell is not
able to perform incoming handover requests and the receiving BSS may stop the
whole handover traffic to this cell.
The traffic load information shall only be valid the time as indicated in the
Time indication Information Element. The control timer shall be stopped with
the receipt of a new LOAD INDICATION message and restarted with the new value.
If the Time field contains the value 0, the load information is no longer
valid.
### 3.1.21 Voice group call service and voice broadcast service call set-up
and resource assignment
To set-up a VGCS/VBS call the MSC initiates the VGCS/VBS set-up procedure to
the BSS. The MSC can then allocate resources to the VGCS/VBS call by
initiating the VGCS/VBS Assignment procedure. If a priority IE is included in
the VGS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message then the priority level in this
Priority IE takes precedence over any priority level that may have been
included in the VGCS/VBS SETUP message.
The BSS and MSC may indicate the support of some optional features through the
VGCS/VBS SETUP and VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK messages. To support an optional feature
both the VGCS/VBS SETUP and VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK messages must indicate that the
feature is supported. The BSS shall only indicate the support of a given
optional feature in the VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK message if the MSC had indicated
its support of this feature in the VGCS/VBS SETUP message. Support of the
following features may be indicated through these messages:
\- A-interface circuit sharing;
\- A-interface link sharing;
\- Talker priority;
\- Group call re-establishment by the BSS;
\- Talker channel parameter.
#### 3.1.21.1 Successful operation
To initiate a VGCS/VBS call set-up procedures the MSC sends to the BSS a
VGCS/VBS SETUP message across VGCS/VBS call controlling SCCP connection. This
connection is established for the life time of the VGCS/VBS call.
The BSS allocates resources to the call and returns VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK message
to the MSC.
When the MSC supports talker priority it shall indicate its support in each
VGCS/VBS SETUP message. If the VGCS/VBS SETUP message indicates support of
talker priority and the BSS supports talker priority, then the VGCS/VBS SETUP
ACK message shall indicate support of talker priority. The network supports
talker priority if both the MSC and BSS indicate their support in the VGCS/VBS
SETUP and VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK messages, respectively.
If the BSS supports one of the requested types of A-interface resource sharing
(that are indicated by the MSC in the VGCS/VBS SETUP message) it includes the
supported type (i.e. either A-interface circuit sharing or A-interface link
sharing) in the VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK.
An MSC or BSS supporting A-interface link sharing shall also support the
procedures for group call re-establishment by the BSS. The network supports
Group call re-establishment by the BSS if both the MSC and BSS indicate their
support of this feature in the VGCS/VBS SETUP and VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK messages
respectively, or if both the MSC and BSS indicate that they support
A-interface link sharing in the VGCS/VBS SETUP or VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK messages,
respectively. An MSC or BSS shall explicitly indicate support of the feature
\"group call re-establishment by the BSS\" in the VGCS Feature Flags IE only,
if the feature is supported in a configuration without A-interface link
sharing.
When the MSC supports talker channel parameter and requires a dedicated
channel to be established for any talker in the cell for a specific group call
it shall explicitly indicate its configuration in each VGCS/VBS SETUP message.
If the VGCS/VBS SETUP message indicates configuration of talker channel
parameter and the BSS supports talker channel parameter, then the VGCS/VBS
SETUP ACK message shall indicate its support and the BSS shall establish and
maintain a dedicated traffic channel for any talker in that group call in the
cell.
#### 3.1.21.2 VGCS/VBS call set-up abnormal cases
If the BSS detects that the VGCS/VBS call is already set-up it will clear all
resources associated with the previous call and proceed with the new call.
If the VGCS Feature Flags IE in the VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK message indicates the
support of an optional feature that was not indicated as supported in the VGCS
Feature Flags IE in the VGCS/VBS SETUP message, then the MSC shall send a
CLEAR COMMAND via the VGCS/VBS call controlling SCCP connection to the BSS and
release the call control SCCP connection.
#### 3.1.21.3 VGCS/VBS call set-up failure
If the BSS can not set-up the VGCS/VBS call then it will send a VGCS/VBS SETUP
REFUSE message to the MSC.
### 3.1.22 Voice group call service and voice broadcast service Assignment
procedure
The purpose of the VGCS/VBS Assignment procedure is to ensure that the correct
dedicated radio resources are allocated to the VGCS/VBS call on a per cell
basis. In case of A-interface link sharing the procedure has to ensure that
the correct dedicated resources are allocated to the VGCS/VBS call on a per
BSS basis. In order to support this procedure the MSC sets up a VGCS/VBS
resource controlling SCCP connection to the BSS. This connection is then used
to support all BSSAP messages related to the dedicated resource(s).
The MSC can command that the radio resources are either allocated immediately
or delayed.
#### 3.1.22.1 Successful operation
The VGCS/VBS call controlling SCCP connection shall be established before the
VGCS/VBS Assignment procedure takes place.
The MSC initiates the VGCS/VBS Assignment procedure to the BSS by sending a
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST on a VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP
connection. If an IP based user plane interface is supported, the Codec List
(MSC Preferred), shall be included in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
If the MSC requests an IP based user plane connection, the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message shall include the \"AoIP Transport Layer Address" allocated by
the MGW and a Call Identifier. In the case of a ciphered group call the MSC
shall provide the BSS with the VSTK and VSTK_RAND. These parameters are used
to derive the voice group or broadcast group ciphering key as described in
3GPP TS 43.020.
If the MSC and BSS have indicated the support of a A-interface circuit sharing
in the VGCS/VBS SETUP and VGCS/VBS SETUP ACK messages respectively, the MSC
shall include the same CIC or the same Call Identifier, AoIP Transport Layer
Address and Codec List (MSC Preferred) in case of AoIP, Channel type and
Downlink DTX flag in all of the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST messages that are
sent to the BSS for a given group call.
The management of priority levels is implementation dependent and under
operator control. Priority rules to handle VBS and VGCS calls are defined in
TS 23.067 and 24.067.
If queuing applies and neither A-interface link sharing nor group call re-
establishment are being used, new requests which cannot be assigned
immediately are put in the queue according to the indicated priority levels
(see sub-clause 3.1.22.4).
The priority levels and the preemption indicators may (singularly or in
combination) be used to determine whether the assignment has to be performed
unconditionally and immediately. This may lead to triggering of the preemption
procedure which may then cause the forced release or forced handover of a
lower priority connection if no free resource is immediately available.
The process and the extent of the preemption procedure is operator dependent,
however, the preemption indicators (refer to sub-clause 3.2.2.18.), if given
in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST shall be treated on a per connection basis
as follows:
\- if the \"Preemption Capability indicator\" bit is set to 1, then this
allocation request can trigger the running of the preemption procedure.
\- if the \"Preemption Capability indicator\" bit is set to 0, then this
allocation request cannot trigger the preemption procedure.
\- if the \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 1, then this connection
is vulnerable and shall be included in the preemption process or procedure and
as such may be subject to forced release or forced handover of a talker in
group transmit mode.
\- if the \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 0, then this connection
is not vulnerable to preemption and shall not be included in the preemption
process and as such may not be subject to forced release or forced handover of
a talker in group transmit mode.
\- if no Priority Information Element has been received, both \"Preemption
Capability\" and \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bits shall be regarded as set to
0.
The MSC shall control VGCS/VBS radio resource allocation on demand to be
enabled or disabled by including \"Assignment Requirement\" IE in VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST and optionally in VGCS/VBS AREA CELL INFO. The MSC uses the
\"Assignment Requirement\" IE to control whether the BSS is allowed to de-
allocate the VGCS/VBS radio resources before the end of the call. If the
_Assignment Requirement_ IE is not included in the VGCS/VBS AREA CELL INFO
message, the method of radio resource allocation for the cells in the _Cell
Identifier List Segment_ IE shall be the same as the one last indicated in
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST or VGCS/VBS AREA CELL INFO.
When the MSC and BSS have indicated the support of a A-interface circuit
sharing, the BSS shall select one channel rate and one speech version for use
in all cells for the group call that are using the same shared circuit or
shared IP address and UDP port value in case of AoIP, based on the first
accepted VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message that is using this circuit or IP
address and UDP port value in case of AoIP.
The BSS will return VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT to the MSC to inform the MSC of
the resources allocated by the BSS for the concerned cell. The BSS shall
include a Circuit Identity Code information element in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
RESULT message indicating the terrestrial circuit which is used for the
VGCS/VBS call, if the BSS allocates the circuit. If the circuit was allocated
by the MSC, the BSS may include the Circuit Identity Code information element
(containing the same value as sent by the MSC) in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
RESULT message. If AoIP is used, the BSS shall include AoIP Transport Layer
Address, Call Identifier (containing the same value as sent by the MSC in the
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message) and Speech Codec (BSC-Chosen) information
elements.
In case of A-interface circuit sharing and AoIP is used, AoIP Transport Layer
Address, Call Identifier and Speech Codec (BSC-Chosen) information elements
shall have the same value for all VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT messages.
If the MSC and BSS have indicated the support of a A-interface circuit
sharing, the BSS shall return a VGCS/VBS Assignment Result message for each
received VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message that indicates the use of the
same CIC or AoIP Transport Layer Address and Call Identifier in case of AoIP,
Channel Type and Downlink DTX flag. The SCCP connections shall be handled in
the same manner irrespective of whether A-interface circuit sharing is used.
In case of A-interface link sharing a list of the cells belonging to the group
call area is included in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST. If the list does not
completely fit into the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message or if different
methods of radio resource allocation are to be used for different cells
controlled by the BSS or the list is segmented because the cell identities
could not be contained in one message for the chosen cell discriminator, the
remaining part of the list is sent in VGCS/VBS AREA CELL INFO messages. The
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is sent first followed by one or more
VGCS/VBS AREA CELL INFO messages until the complete list of cells has been
transferred to the BSS. The Cell Identifier IE of the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message shall indicate the cell of origin, if controlled by that BSS.
In the other case no further information shall be included in this IE. The
Cell identification discriminator shall be set to indicate that no cell is
associated with the transaction. See subclause 3.2.2.17. The _Cell Identifier
List Segment_ IE shall be included in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message
if one or more cells have to be identified by this IE or one or more VGCS/VBS
AREA CELL INFO messages is to follow. The BSS is responsible for the
establishment and re-establishment of the radio resources for the different
cells.
In case of A-interface link sharing, if the originating cell is served by the
BSS, the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message shall be returned once the
resource for this cell is established.
In the case of A-interface link sharing, if the originating cell is not served
by the BSS the, the BSS shall return the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message
even if no resource can be established. If resources could not be established
in any cell, the Channel field in the _Chosen Channel_ IE shall be set to
\"none\" and a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message shall be sent to the MSC as
soon as the first cell is established.
Timer Tast is (re-)started after sending either a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT
or a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message to the MSC. The timer is stopped when
the associated A-interface link is released. The A-interface link established
by this procedure is not pre-emptable and will only be released if the call is
released. This A-interface link is shared by the control and user plane of all
group call channels involved in the VGCS/VBS call at the given BSS.
In case of A-interface link sharing and when the network supports uplink
access option (i) as defined in 3GPP TS 43.068 (i.e. an indication in the
uplink busy instructs the MS to use the group call channel to send the uplink
access message if the talker on the group call channel is not in the same cell
as the MS) the BSS and MSC shall include talker priority information in
A-interface messages on the resource controlling SCCP connection as specified
in subclause 3.2.1. The Talker Priority information may be used to distinguish
between messages related to the current talker and messages related to another
subscriber requesting the uplink.
The BSS shall initiate the radio interface notification procedure on the NCH
of the cell in which the call is to take place, this may continue at regular
intervals until the call is released or the cell has been reported as released
for the voice group or broadcast call. The BSS may on SACCH indicate that a
change of notification has occurred and/or initiate notification on FACCH.
In the case where the BSS deallocates/allocates resources to the cell and
neither A-interface link sharing or group call re-establishment by the network
are supported, the BSS sends an VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message on the
VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP connection associated to the cell.
In the case where the BSS deallocates resources to the cell and group call re-
establishment by the BSS is supported by the network and A-interface link
sharing is not being used, then the BSS sends an VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS
message on the VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP connection associated to the
cell indicating the reason for the release.
In case of A-interface link sharing the BSS waits for timer Tast to expire
before it sends to the MSC a report of the cells whose status has changed
since the most recently sent VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message (or group of
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS messages) or VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message was
generated. This report is sent using one or, if needed, more VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT STATUS messages. If no change occurred the message shall not be
sent. Timer Tast shall be re-started each time it expires. A report
(comprising one or, if needed, more VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS messages) shall
be sent immediately and timer Tast shall be re-started when the group call is
established in all cells served by this A-Interface link for the first time.
The VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message shall indicate to the MSC cells where
\- the call is established; or
\- the BSS will attempt to establish the call; or
\- the call is released because there is no user present in that cell; or
\- the BSS will not attempt to establish the call.
NOTE: These lists may not be applicable in all cases. The usage of the lists
varies according to the features supported by the network.
A cell shall appear in at most one list within a given VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
STATUS message and shall appear at most once within a report comprising a
group of VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS messages.
In the case of voice group calls, if the MSC has informed the BSS to which
voice group call the originator MS belongs to, the BSS may decide to modify
the originator dedicated channel into a voice group call channel relating to
the group call reference. If the BSS modifies the channel it will send the
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message on the resource controlling SCCP connection
and then immediately afterwards send a CLEAR REQUEST cause \"Joined group call
channel\" on the originator dedicated connection.
#### 3.1.22.2 VGCS/VBS Assignment abnormal cases
In the abnormal case, where a BSS detects that a voice broadcast or voice
group call already exists with the same group call reference in a cell (this
may occur due to SCCP problems), the BSS shall release the radio resources
associated with the cell for the present existing voice broadcast or voice
group call and shall allocate resources to the new call.
If the requested channel type indicated in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message is not available in the BSS, then an VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE
message shall be returned to the MSC. The appropriate failure cause will be
included in the message (Cause value: \"requested transcoding/rate adaptation
unavailable\" or \"requested speech version unavailable\" or \"Requested Codec
Type or Codec Configuration unavailable\" or \"Requested Codec Type or Codec
Configuration not supported\" or \"Requested A-Interface Type unavailable\" or
\"Requested A-Interface Type not supported\").
If the MSC requested an IP-bearer for the A-Interface by providing the AoIP
Transport Layer Address and not providing a Circuit Identity Code, but the BSS
is not able to use an IP-bearer, then the BSS shall not allocate a Circuit
Identity Code on its own, even if the Codec List (MSC Preferred) included a
Codec Type with the PT bit set to \"1\", but shall return an VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message to the MSC with the Cause value \"Requested
A-Interface Type unavailable\".
If the BSS receives a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message calling up a
terrestrial circuit that is already assigned to another call then a VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message will be returned with a Cause value of:
\"terrestrial circuit already allocated\" and no action will be taken on the
radio interface.
If the BSS receives a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message allocating a
terrestrial circuit which has been blocked by a previous blocking procedure,
then an VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message shall be sent (Cause value:
\"requested terrestrial resource unavailable\"). A BLOCK message (not repeated
and not guarded by timer T1) shall be sent for that concerned terrestrial
circuit.
If the BSS receives a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message that contains an
Encryption Information IE that indicates that the radio resource is to be
ciphered, but the message does not contain both the VSTK_RAND and VSTK
information elements, then a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message shall be sent
(Cause value of: \"invalid message contents\").
When the voice group call has been configured to use A-interface circuit
sharing and either the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message does not contain a
CIC or AoIP Transport Layer Address, Call Identifier and Codec List (MSC
preferred) in case of AoIP, or the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST messages
contains a different CIC or different AoIP Transport Layer Address, Call
Identifier and Codec List (MSC preferred) in case of AoIP, Channel Type or
Downlink DTX flag from that sent in a previous VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message for a given group call within a given BSS, then the BSS shall reply
with VGCS Assignment Failure message (Cause value: \"invalid message
contents\"). Also, if the cell identified in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT message
does not support the selected channel rate and speech version, then the BSS
shall reply with VGCS Assignment Failure message (Cause value: \"requested
transcoding/rate adaptation unavailable\" or \"requested speech version
unavailable\" or \"Requested Codec Type or Codec Configuration unavailable\"
or \"Requested Codec Type or Codec Configuration not supported\" or
\"Requested A-Interface Type unavailable\" or \"Requested A-Interface Type not
supported\").
If the BSS receives, in the case of A-interface link sharing, more than one
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message with the same group call reference, the
BSS shall release the radio resources and terrestrial resources associated
with the present existing voice broadcast or voice group call and shall
allocate resources to the new call and the BSS shall stop timer Tast. (The
timer will be started again after the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message is
sent.)
If, in the case of A-interface link sharing, the BSS receives in the Cell
Identifier List Segment IEs (contained within VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST or
VGCS/VBS AREA CELL INFO messages) multiple references to the same cell (either
within a single IE or within multiple IEs), the BSS shall send either a CLEAR
REQUEST (if a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message has already been sent) or a
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message (if no VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message
has been sent) with cause value \"Invalid Message Contents\" to the MSC.
If, in the case of A-interface link sharing, the BSS receives a VGCS/VBS AREA
CELL INFO message with a sequence number higher than the sequence length (as
indicated in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message), the BSS shall send
either a CLEAR REQUEST (if a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT RESULT message has already
been sent) or a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message (if no VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
RESULT message has been sent) with cause value \"Invalid Message Contents\" to
the MSC. If, in case of A-interface circuit sharing and AoIP, the MSC receives
different Speech Codec information element value within VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
RESULT messages, the MSC shall send CLEAR COMMAND message with cause value
"Requested Codec Type or Codec Configuration not supported" to the BSC.
#### 3.1.22.3 VGCS/VBS Assignment failure
In the case where the VGCS/VBS call is unknown by the BSS, the BSS shall
return the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message (cause \"VGCS/VBS call non
existent\").
In the case where no radio resource can be allocated to the VGCS/VBS call, the
BSS shall return the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message (cause \"No radio
resource available\").
In case of A-interface link sharing, the BSS shall return the VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message (cause \"No radio resource available\") if the
originating service subscriber is served by the BSS and resources for the cell
of origin cannot be allocated.
In the case where no radio resource can be allocated to the VGCS/VBS call for
channel establishment on demand and A-interface link sharing is not being
used, the BSS shall return the CLEAR REQUEST message (cause \"No radio
resource available\").
NOTE: In the case of A-interface link sharing, the BSS is responsible for the
re-establishment and does not send the CLEAR REQUEST message.
In the case where the MSC has attempted to assign a terrestrial circuit and an
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message has been returned then both the MSC and
the BSS shall consider that the terrestrial circuit is idle (except already
allocated to another call or to another connection in the same VGCS/VBS call
if A-interface circuit sharing has been configured or blocked terrestrial
circuit) and therefore no explicit clearing sequence is needed.
If the BSS is unable to allocate any resources for a cell not serving the
originating subscriber when it receives a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message
and group call re-establishment by the BSS is supported by the network but
A-interface link sharing is not being used, then the BSS shall send a VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT RESULT message with a _Chosen Channel_ IE in which the channel
field is set to \"none\". Additionally the BSS shall send a VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT STATUS message to the MSC.
NOTE: In case of A-interface link sharing the procedure in case the call
cannot be established in any cell and the cell serving the originating
subscriber is not parented by the BSS is described in sub-clause 3.1.22.1.
In the case that group call re-establishment by the BSS is supported by the
network but A-interface link sharing is not being used and the BSS receives a
VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message for the cell serving the originating
subscriber that requires resources that use failed equipment or resources that
cannot be allocated because of congestion, then the BSS shall send to the MSC
a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message.
#### 3.1.22.4 VGCS/VBS Queuing Indication
This subclause is not applicable if A-Interface link sharing or group call re-
establishment by BSS is used.
In a BSS supporting the VGCS/VBS message queuing, the purpose of the VGCS/VBS
QUEUING INDICATION message is to inform the MSC about a delay in the
allocation of the necessary dedicated radio resources.
When a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is received which cannot be served
immediately due to lack of available resources and if the \"Queuing Allowed\"
bit in the Priority Information Element indicates that queuing is allowed,
then the request shall be put into a queue and timer T14 shall be started. The
timer value T14 specifies the maximum queuing delay and is determined by the
operator. The VGCS/VBS QUEUING INDICATION message shall be returned to the
MSC.
The queuing procedure shall be terminated with a successful or unsuccessful
assignment of the required traffic channel(s) by sending a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT
RESULT or a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message, respectively, to the MSC.
If the timer T14 expires the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message shall be
removed from the queue and a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message shall be sent
to the MSC, with the Cause \"no radio resource available\" (refer to sub-
clause 3.1.22.3).
If a resource in a queue could be successfully established, the timer T14 is
stopped.
### 3.1.23 (void)
### 3.1.24 Voice group call uplink control procedure - talker priority not
supported by the network
In the case of voice group calls the uplink resource allocated to the call is
controlled by the uplink control procedure. The uplink control procedure uses
messages sent on the VGCS/VBS controlling SCCP connection set-up by the
VGCS/VBS call set-up procedure.
The procedure is split into three procedures: uplink allocation; uplink
release; & uplink seize.
The uplink allocation is controlled by the BSSs and group call anchor MSC. The
BSS controls the uplink access for the cells in the group call area which are
under its control. The group call anchor MSC controls the uplink access for
the complete service area. Any allocation of the uplink access by a BSS may be
refused later by the group call anchor MSC (due to the allocation of the
uplink by other BSSs involved in the same voice group call).
The uplink release & uplink seize procedure is controlled and initiated by the
MSC, the BSS obeys the MSC\'s requests.
When the voice group call is initially set-up the state of the uplink in each
BSS is such that the uplink is seized. The MSC will control the state of the
uplink in each BSS by use of the uplink release and uplink seize procedures.
Before an uplink may be allocated by the BSS, the MSC must have released the
uplink by initiating the uplink release procedure.
#### 3.1.24.1 Uplink allocation procedure
The uplink allocation procedure allows a listening user in a voice group call
to talk on the uplink of the TCH dedicated to the voice group call in the
cell.
The uplink allocation procedure can only occur once the group call anchor MSC
has released the uplink (by use of the uplink release procedure).
When a mobile relinquishes the uplink or the BSS detects that the MS is no
longer connected, the BSS sends to the MSC an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION
message with cause value \"Call control\" or \"Radio interface failure\"
respectively. Then the BSS shall initiate the radio interface uplink free
procedure.
##### 3.1.24.1.1 Successful uplink allocation operation
On reception of a request to talk, the BSS sends an UPLINK REQUEST message to
the MSC. The MSC sends the UPLINK REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to confirm to
the BSS that the uplink is granted to the requesting MS. The MSC also sends to
all the other BSSs in the voice group call an UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message.
The BSS sends UPLINK REQUEST CONFIRMATION message with the complete layer
information, once the radio link has been established. The layer information
may include the ciphering key sequence number.
##### 3.1.24.1.2 Unsuccessful uplink allocation operation
In the case that the radio link could not be established the BS sends the
Uplink release indication with the cause \"Radiolink interface message
failure\".
In the case the MSC does not want to grant the uplink, the MSC will send an
UPLINK REJECT COMMAND message to the appropriate BSS. On reception of this the
BSS will release the uplink for the requesting MS.
#### 3.1.24.2 Uplink release procedure
This procedure shall be used in one of the following cases:
\- the group call anchor MSC detects that none of the parties involved in a
voice group call are talking . The Uplink release procedure is then used to
allow the listening subscribers to talk;
\- the group call anchor or relay MSC detects that the talker has left the
Group Call Area.
To initiate this procedure the group call anchor MSC sends the UPLINK RELEASE
COMMAND message to each BSS involved in the voice group call. When the BSS
receives the Uplink release request command, the BSS shall initiate the radio
interface uplink release procedure.
#### 3.1.24.3 Uplink seize procedure
This procedure shall be used by the MSC to inform a given BSS that the uplink
has been successfully granted to a talking subscriber in another BSS area. To
initiate the procedure the MSC sends UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message to that
given BSS. On reception of the UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message the BSS will
initiate the radio interface uplink busy procedure.
### 3.1.24a Voice group call uplink control procedure - talker priority
supported by the network
#### 3.1.24.a.1 General
Each network node that is involved in the group call shall maintain a record
of the current call talker priority setting. The priority setting may be one
of the following:
\- normal subscriber request;
\- privileged subscriber request;
\- emergency subscriber request.
In the case of voice group calls the uplink resource allocated to the call is
controlled by the uplink control procedure. The uplink control procedure uses
messages sent on the VGCS/VBS controlling SCCP connection set-up by the
VGCS/VBS call set-up procedure.
The procedure is split into five procedures: uplink allocation; uplink
release; uplink seize, emergency reset and talker information.
The uplink allocation is controlled by the BSSs and group call anchor MSC. The
BSS controls the uplink access for the cells in the group call area which are
under its control. The group call anchor MSC controls the uplink access for
the complete service area. Any allocation of the uplink by a BSS may be
refused later by the group call anchor or relay MSC (due to the allocation of
the uplink by other BSSs involved in the same voice group call or because the
mobile station was not permitted to use the talker priority in the uplink
request).
The uplink release, uplink seize and emergency reset procedure is controlled
and initiated by the MSC. The BSS obeys the MSC\'s requests.
When the voice group call is initially set-up the state of the uplink in each
BSS is such that the uplink is seized. The MSC will control the state of the
uplink in each BSS by use of the uplink release and uplink seize procedures.
#### 3.1.24a.2 Uplink allocation procedure
The uplink allocation procedure allows a listening user in a voice group call
to talk on the uplink of the TCH dedicated to the voice group call in the
cell.
The uplink allocation procedure can occur in the following situations:
\- once the group call anchor MSC has released the uplink (by use of the
uplink release procedure);
\- or when there is a talker request with a higher priority than that of the
current talker.
When a mobile relinquishes the uplink or the BSS detects that the MS is no
longer connected, the BSS sends to the MSC an UPLINK RELEASE INDICATION
message with cause value \"Call control\" or \"Radio interface failure\"
respectively. Then the BSS shall initiate the radio interface uplink free
procedure if there is no current talker.
##### 3.1.24a.2.1 Successful uplink allocation operation
###### 3.1.24a.2.1.1 Normal Priority Request
Behaviour is as defined in sub-clause 3.1.24.1.
###### 3.1.24a.2.1.2 Privileged or Emergency Priority Request via Uplink
Access procedure
On reception of a request to talk with privileged or emergency priority, the
BSS sends an UPLINK REQUEST message to the MSC. The BSS sends UPLINK REQUEST
message with the Layer 3 information once the link has been established on the
radio interface. The Layer 3 information shall include the MS identity and may
include the ciphering key sequence number.
The MSC sends the UPLINK REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to confirm to the BSS
that the uplink is granted to the requesting MS. This message shall contain
the talker priority so that the BSS is able to determine which uplink request
is being acknowledged. It shall also contain the status of the emergency mode.
The BSS shall update the current talker priority when the priority in the
UPLINK REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message is greater than the current talker
priority, and releases the uplink for an MS being pre-empted if it is served
by this BSS.
The MSC also sends to all the other BSSs in the voice group call an UPLINK
SEIZED COMMAND message, containing the talker priority. Additionally, if the
uplink priority was 'Emergency', then the UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message shall
also contain the Emergency set indication IE.
The BSS shall compare the talker priority received in an UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND
message with the current talker priority. The BSS shall update the current
talker priority when the priority in the UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message is
greater than the current talker priority, and releases the uplink for an MS
being pre-empted if it is served by this BSS. The BSS shall discard an UPLINK
SEIZED COMMAND message that contains a talker priority that is less than or
equal to the current talker priority.
When the uplink request pre-empts the current talker, the MSC shall send a
CLEAR COMMAND to the talker that is being pre-empted, if the current talker is
on a dedicated channel. The cause field shall be set to 'Call Control'.
###### 3.1.24a.2.1.3 Privileged or Emergency Priority Request via Priority
Uplink Request procedure
On reception of a request to talk with privileged or emergency priority, the
BSS sends an UPLINK REQUEST message to the MSC. The UPLINK REQUEST message
shall include the MS identity.
The MSC sends the UPLINK REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to confirm to the BSS
that the uplink is granted to the requesting MS. This message shall contain
the talker priority so that the BSS is able to determine which uplink request
is being acknowledged. It shall also contain the status of the emergency mode.
The BSS shall update the current talker priority when the priority in the
UPLINK REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message is greater than the current talker
priority, and release the uplink for an MS being pre-empted if it is served by
this BSS.
The MSC also sends to all the other BSSs in the voice group call an UPLINK
SEIZED COMMAND message, containing the talker priority. Additionally, if the
uplink priority was 'Emergency', then the UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message shall
also contain the Emergency Set Indication IE.
The BSS shall compare the talker priority received in an UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND
message with the current talker priority. The BSS shall update the current
talker priority when the priority in the UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message is
greater than the current talker priority, and release the uplink for an MS
being pre-empted if it is served by this BSS. The BSS shall discard an UPLINK
SEIZED COMMAND message that contains a talker priority that is less than or
equal to the current talker priority.
The BSS sends the UPLINK CONFIRM message with the Layer 3 information once the
link to the requesting MS has been established on the radio interface. The
Layer 3 information shall include the MS identity and may include the
ciphering key sequence number.
##### 3.1.24a.2.2 Unsuccessful uplink allocation operation
###### 3.1.24a.2.2.1 Normal Priority Uplink Request
Behaviour is as defined in 3.1.24.1.2.
Additionally, in the case the UPLINK REQUEST message contained a talker
priority that was less than or equal to the current talker priority that is
stored in the MSC, the MSC sends an UPLINK REJECT COMMAND message to the
appropriate BSS, containing the priority that was in the UPLINK REQUEST
message that was being rejected and the current talker priority. The cause
field shall be set to 'Call Control'. On reception of this message the BSS
will release the uplink for the requesting MS that is being rejected, if not
already released. The BSS shall set its current talker priority to the current
talker priority that was received in the UPLINK REJECT command message.
The BSC shall compare the talker priority received in an UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND
message with the current talker priority. If the priority is less than the
current priority, then the BSC shall discard the command.
###### 3.1.24a.2.2.2 Privileged or Emergency Uplink Request via Uplink Access
procedure
In the case that the radio link could not be established the BSS sends the
Uplink release indication with the cause \"Radiolink interface message
failure\".
In the case the MSC does not want to grant the uplink, the MSC will send an
UPLINK REJECT COMMAND message to the appropriate BSS. The UPLINK REJECT
COMMAND message shall contain the talker priority of the request that is being
rejected together with the current talker priority so that the BSS is able to
determine which uplink request is rejected. On reception of this the BSS will
release the uplink for the requesting MS, if not already released, and set the
current talker priority to the value of the priority in the Current Talker
Priority IE received in the UPLINK REJECT COMMAND message.
In the case the UPLINK REQUEST message contained a talker priority that was
less than or equal to the current talker priority that is stored in the MSC,
the MSC sends an UPLINK REJECT COMMAND message to the appropriate BSS,
containing the priority that was in the UPLINK REQUEST that was being rejected
and the current talker priority. The cause field shall be set to 'Call
Control'. On reception of this the BSS will release the uplink for the
requesting MS and set the current talker priority to the value of the priority
in the Current Talker Priority IE received in the UPLINK REJECT COMMAND
message.
If an MSC receives an UPLINK REQUEST message, but either no mobile station
identity is provided in the Layer 3 information or the mobile station is not
permitted to send the requested priority, then the MSC shall send an UPLINK
REJECT COMMAND message to the appropriate BSS, containing the requested
priority and the current talker priority. The cause field shall be set to
'Requested option not authorised'. On reception of this the BSS will release
the uplink for the requesting MS and set the current talker priority to the
value of the priority in the Current Talker Priority IE received in the UPLINK
REJECT COMMAND message.
###### 3.1.24a.2.2.3 Privileged or Emergency Uplink Request via Priority
Uplink Request procedure
All other cases are as per sub-clause 3.1.24a.2.2.2, with the exception that
there is no uplink for the BSS to release.
#### 3.1.24a.3 Uplink release procedure
Behaviour is as defined in 3.1.24.2.
#### 3.1.24a.4 Uplink seize procedure
This procedure shall be used by the MSC to inform a given BSS that the uplink
has been successfully granted to a talking subscriber in another BSS area. To
initiate the procedure the MSC sends UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message to that
given BSS. The UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND message shall contain the current talker
priority and the status of the emergency mode. On reception of the UPLINK
SEIZED COMMAND message the BSS will initiate the radio interface uplink busy
procedure.
#### 3.1.24a.5 Emergency Reset procedure via UPLINK ACCESS message
3.1.24a.5.0 Successful
On reception a request to reset the emergency mode, the BSS sends an EMERGENCY
RESET INDICATION message to the MSC. The BSS sends the EMERGENCY RESET
INDICATION message with the Layer 3 information once the link has been
established on the radio interface. The Layer 3 information shall include the
MS identity and may include the ciphering key sequence number.
When the MSC receives a EMERGENCY RESET INDICATION message and the emergency
mode is set, the MSC shall check that the mobile is allowed to issue the
command. If the emergency mode is set and the mobile is allowed to issue the
command, then the MSC shall send an EMERGENCY RESET COMMAND message to each
BSS involved in the group call.
The BSS on receipt of the EMERGENCY RESET COMMAND message shall reset the
emergency mode.
#### 3.1.24a.5.1 Unsuccessful
The MSC shall discard the EMERGENCY RESET INDICATION message if the emergency
mode is not set or the mobile station is not allowed to issue the command.
#### 3.1.24a.6 Emergency Reset procedure via PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message
3.1.24a.6.0 Successful
On reception of a request to reset the emergency mode, the BSS sends an
EMERGENCY RESET INDICATION message to the MSC. The EMERGENCY RESET INDICATION
message shall include the MS identity.
When the MSC receives an EMERGENCY RESET INDICATION message and the emergency
mode is set, the MSC shall check that the mobile is allowed to issue the
command. If the emergency mode is set and the mobile is allowed to issue the
command, then the MSC shall send an EMERGENCY RESET COMMAND message to each
BSS involved in the group call.
The BSS on receipt of the EMERGENCY RESET COMMAND message shall reset the
emergency mode.
#### 3.1.24a.6.1 Unsuccessful
As per subclause 3.1.24a.5.1
### 3.1.24b Talker Information
The MSC may send a VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION message containing information
regarding the identity of the current talker to each BSS in the group call
area. Each of these VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION messages is sent on the group
call's call controlling SCCP connection. In the case that the VGCS talker that
is being pre-empted is on a dedicated channel, the MSC sends a VGCS ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION message on the VGCS talker's dedicated SCCP connection.
On reception of the VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION message on the group call's
call controlling SCCP connection, the BSS will initiate the transmission of
the additional information on the radio interface in each cell in which the
group call is active.
On reception of the VGCS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION message on the VGCS talker's
dedicated SCCP connection, the BSS will initiate the transmission of the
additional information on the VGCS talker's dedicated channel.
The MSC may also send the talker information (talker identity IE) in the
UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND, UPLINK REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE or UPLINK REJECT COMMAND
messages. On reception of an UPLINK SEIZED COMMAND, UPLINK REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
or UPLINK REJECT COMMAND message containing the talker identity IE, the BSC
will initiate the transmission of the additional information on the radio
interface in each cell in which the group call is active.
### 3.1.24c SMS to ongoing VGCS call all
The MSC may send a short message to the members that are participating in the
voice group call by sending one or more VGCS SMS messages to each BSS that is
in the group call area. Each VGCS SMS message transports a RP-Data message
(see 3GPP TS 24.011) containing all or part of the short message. The VGCS SMS
message is sent on the group call's call controlling SCCP connection.
On reception of the VGCS SMS message on the group call's call controlling SCCP
connection, the BSS will initiate the transmission of the RP-Data message on
the VGCS group channel in each cell in which the group call is active. In the
case that the VGCS talker is on a dedicated channel the BSC will also initiate
the transmission of the RP-Data message on the VGCS talker's dedicated
channel.
### 3.1.24d Distributing application-specific data to ongoing VGCS call
On reception of a Data Indication message or Data Indication 2 message (see
3GPP TS 44.018) an UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message may be sent from the BSS to
the MSC on the group call\'s call controlling SCCP connection.
On reception of an UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message from a BSS, the MSC may
send a NOTIFICATION DATA message containing application-specific data and
optionally the sender's mobile identity to each BSS in the group call area.
Each of these NOTIFCATION DATA messages is sent on the group call's call
controlling SCCP connection.
On reception of a NOTIFCATION DATA message on the group call's call
controlling SCCP connection, the BSS shall broadcast the notification data to
all listeners and the talker by initiating the transmission of the data on the
radio interface to each cell in which the group call is active (see 3GPP TS
44.018).
Optionally the BSS may distribute the application-specific data immediately,
upon receiving the application data from the MS. The application data will
then be distributed to the cells within the BSS area belonging to the group
call area the BSS shall indicate this in the Application Data Information IE
to the MSC. In this case, the MSC shall not send the NOTIFICATION DATA message
to that BSS.
### 3.1.25 PDSS1 flow control
The purpose of the PDSS1 flow control procedure is to inform the MSC that it
should stop or resume transmission of PDSS1 data on this particular
transaction.
The BSS may on the relevant SCCP connection associated with an MS transaction
send a SUSPEND message to the MSC to ask the MSC not to transmit DTAP messages
carrying air interface layer 3 messages of the PDSS1 protocol. A typical
reason is that too many messages are scheduled for transmission on the air
interface.
The BSS may on the relevant SCCP connection associated with an MS transaction
send a RESUME message to the MSC to indicate to the MSC that DTAP messages
carrying air interface layer 3 messages of the PDSS1 protocol may be
transmitted (the typical reason is that congestion on the air interface
signalling channel does no more exist).
### 3.1.26 Circuit re-selection procedure
This procedure has to be supported by a BSS if and only if it allocates the A
interface circuits.
The MSC can request the BSS to change the circuit allocated to a connection by
sending a CHANGE CIRCUIT message to the BSS on the corresponding SCCP
connection. The MSC releases the allocated circuit at the sending of the
CHANGE CIRCUIT message.
The MSC shall not start the circuit re-selection procedure if another
procedure is on-going that may result in the change of the circuit (e.g.
circuit re-selection, handover or clearing).
At the reception of a CHANGE CIRCUIT message, and if the BSS is not already
engaged in a procedure that normally results in the release of the allocated
circuit (e.g. handover or clearing), the BSS allocates a new circuit and
indicates it in CHANGE CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE message sent back to the MSC. The
BSS releases the previously allocated circuit after the sending of the CHANGE
CIRCUIT ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the MSC receives a message from the BSS indicating the start of a procedure
that may result in the change of the circuit (e.g. reception of HANDOVER
REQUIRED or CLEAR REQUEST), the MSC shall abort the circuit re‑selection
procedure.
The MSC may not be able to use the terrestrial resource that the BSS has
indicated. In this case, the procedure is nevertheless considered terminated
successfully, and it is up to the MSC to correct the situation, e.g., by a new
circuit re-selection procedure.
### 3.1.27 LSA handling
The MSC may send the LSA INFORMATION message at any time during the lifetime
of the relevant SCCP connection. The message is not acknowledged.
The BSS shall store the LSA identity list internally for the connection and
use it for the control of internal and external handover.
In the case of overlapping LSAs, the LSA identity signalled in messages by the
BSS towards the MSC shall be the LSA identity with the highest priority.
Upon reception of a new lists of LSA identities the BSS will discard the
previous LSA identity list and use the new LSA identity list. The BSS shall
always accept the LSA identity list, but shall ignore LSA identities, which
are not known.
If the subscriber has LSA only access this has to be taken into account in the
\"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\" in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message (see
sub-clause \"Generation of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message\"). If the subscriber
has LSA only access the LSA only access indicator is set to zero at an
emergency call.
Exclusive access cells may be included into \"Cell Identifier List
(preferred)\" in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message (see sub-clause \"Generation of
the HANDOVER REQUIRED message\") if at least one LSA identity defined in the
exclusive access cell corresponds to any LSA identity received in the HANDOVER
REQUEST or the latest LSA INFORMATION message. Exclusive access cells may also
be included if the connection is an emergency call.
### 3.1.28 Location Acquisition
This procedure is utilized to support Location Services (see 3GPP TS 43.071).
It is used to pass information transparently between the SMLC and BSS and
request location of the target MS from the BSS.
#### 3.1.28.1 (void)
#### 3.1.28.2 Location request
#### 3.1.28.2.1 Successful Operation
PERFORM LOCATION REQUEST message may be sent in order to perform location
procedure for the target MS. This message may be sent from the MSC to the BSS.
This message may contain the following information:
\- Location type;
\- GANSS Location type
\- Cell Identifier;
\- Classmark Information Type 3;
\- LCS Client Type;
\- Chosen Channel;
\- LCS Priority;
\- Quality of service;
\- GPS Assistance Data;
\- GANSS Assistance Data;
\- APDU, variable length octet string of which content is defined in 3GPP TS
49.031 and 3GPP TS 48.071;
\- IMSI;
\- IMEI.
On receipt of the PERFORM LOCATION REQUEST message for positioning of the
target MS, the BSS transfers the positioning request to the SMLC according to
the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 49.031 and awaits the
result. The BSS then returns the result of positioning to the MSC in the
PERFORM LOCATION RESPONSE message. This message contains following
information:
\- Location estimate;
\- Velocity estimate;
\- Positioning data;
\- GANSS positioning data.
If assistance data was instead requested by the MSC for an MS, the BSS
transfers the request to the SMLC according to the procedures defined in 3GPP
TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 49.031 and awaits the result. If the SMLC was able
successfully to transfer this to the MS, the BSS shall return a PERFORM
LOCATION RESPONSE message to the MSC. This message shall contain no
parameters. The absence of an LCS Cause parameter in this case implies that
the transfer was successful.
Otherwise, if a deciphering keys were requested for LCS broadcast assistance
data, the BSS transfers the request to the SMLC according to the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 43.059 and 3GPP TS 49.031 and awaits the result. If the
SMLC has access to the appropriate keys, the BSS shall return a PERFORM
LOCATION RESPONSE message to MSC. This message contains following information:
\- Deciphering Keys.
#### 3.1.28.2.2 Unsuccessful Operation {#unsuccessful-operation .list-
paragraph}
If the BSS fails to respond to the PERFORM LOCATION REQUEST message it returns
a PERFORM LOCATION RESPONSE message with a LCS cause value indicating the
failure cause. Possible failure causes are listed in 3GPP TS 49.031.
#### 3.1.28.2.3 Abnormal cases {#abnormal-cases .list-paragraph}
The following condition may occur:
If the MSC needs to abort previously initiated location request, it shall send
the PERFORM LOCATION ABORT message to the BSS. As a result of reception of
this message the BSS shall abort activities related to positioning of the
target MS or assistance data delivery. The BSS shall return a PERFORM LOCATION
RESPONSE with a cause value indicating the abortion of location request.
##### 3.1.28.2.4 Overload
For location requests initiated by the MSC, the BSC may employ the same
procedures defined for an SMLC in 3GPP TS 49.031 to alleviate an overload
condition in the BSS.
### 3.1.29 Connectionless Information Transfer procedure {#connectionless-
information-transfer-procedure .list-paragraph}
The SMLC may send information to another SMLC transparently via the BSS, or
via BSS and MSC.
The CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION message shall be sent via the BSSMAP as a
connectionless message.
The BSS shall send the CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION message to the MSC with the
following information:
\- Network Element Identity (source), which define the source SMLC for the
message;
\- Network Element Identity (target), which define the target SMLC for the
message;
\- Variable length octet string (APDU IE), of which content is defined in 3GPP
TS 49.031;
\- Segmentation IE containing segmentation and message identification:
included only with a segmented APDU;
\- The Return Error Request may be included to request notification in the
event of unsuccessful transfer.
On receipt of the CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION message, the MSC transmits this
message to another MSC or BSS on a direct path to the target SMLC, as derived
from the Network Element Identity (target) IE. The contents of APDU IE is
transparent to the MSC.
If the source SMLC and the target SMLC are associated with different MSCs,
then the CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION message shall forwarded between MSCs via
the BSSMAP-LE as a connectionless message (see 3GPP TS 49.031).
##### 3.1.29.1 Unsuccessful Operation
Unsuccessful operation is specified within Connectionless Information Transfer
procedure in 3GPP TS 49.031.
##### 3.1.29.2 Abnormal cases
Abnormal cases are specified within Connectionless Information Transfer
procedure in 3GPP TS 49.031.
##### 3.1.29.3 Segmentation
The Segmentation parameter shall not be included if the APDU is not segmented.
If the size of an embedded SMLCPP message is too large to fit into one
CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION message, the sending entity divides the SMLCPP
message to a necessary number of CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION messages each
containing an APDU IE and a Segmentation IE. In the APDU IE it includes as
many octets as possible.
The segmentation IE contains a segment number, an indication of the final
segment and the message ID. The order number of a segment in the Segment
Number field in the SEGMENTATION IE is incremented by one starting from zero,
i.e. the value is 0 for the first segment, 1 for the next and so on. The
receiving entity recognizes that a segment is missing or duplicated, when:
\- There is more than one segment with the same segment number and same
Message ID;
\- The segment number does not increase by steps of one starting from zero.
If the recipient recognizes a missing or duplicated element, it shall discard
the entire message (i.e. all received segment with the message ID).
The message identity in the Message ID field in the SEGMENTATION IE is used to
recognize a particular message to which the segment belongs. The sending
entity can select any of the available values (0 - 65535) that is not
currently used between it and the receiving entity.
If an APDU segment is received with Return Errror cause IE (due to invocation
of the return error option), reassembly does not apply and the APDU segment
and error cause maybe returned to the original source application.
### 3.1.30 Common ID
The purpose of the Common ID procedure is to inform the BSC about the IMSI of
a user. This may be used by the BSC to e.g. create a reference between the
user and the RR and SCCP connections of that user for paging co-ordination.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
An MSC may send a COMMON ID message as soon as the SCCP connection has been
established.
If the MS, the BSS and the MSC support DTM and as soon as the IMSI is
available at the MSC, the MSC shall send the COMMON ID message to the BSS.
If the SCCP connection is established due to CSFB from E-UTRAN and the MSC
supports return to the last used PLMN after CS fallback, then it should send
the COMMON ID message to the BSS including the _Last used E-UTRAN PLMN ID_
information element if available at the MSC immediately following the
successful SCCP connection setup.
If the MSC is configured to use GWCN network sharing and the BSS indicates
that the MS did not select a PLMN (i.e. the MS did not send an initial Layer 3
message that included a PLMN index), then the MSC shall send the COMMON ID
message to the BSS indicating the Selected PLMN ID.
The BSC associates the permanent identity to the RR and SCCP connections of
that user for the duration of the RR connection.
### 3.1.31 VGCS/VBS Cell Re-established - no A-interface link sharing
If the condition is removed, that caused the sending of the VGCS/VBS
ASSIGNMENT STATUS message indicating that the cell is released for the voice
group or broadcast call, the BSS shall inform the MSC of the recovery by
sending it a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT status message, indicating that the voice
group or broadcast call has been established in the cell.
The BSS shall reallocate a radio resource for the group channel and initiate
the radio interface notification procedure on the NCH of the cell in which the
call is to take place. The notification procedure may continue at regular
intervals until the call is released or the cell has been released for the
voice group or broadcast call.
When the MSC receives a VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT status message it shall update its
record of the status of the cell.
### 3.1.32 Rerouting procedure in case of MOCN configuration for network
sharing
#### 3.1.32.1 General
This procedure shall be supported by a BSS if and only if it supports the MOCN
configuration (see [52]).
In the MOCN configuration the radio access part of the network is shared.
There may be more than one A-Interface towards the CS domain of different CN
operators from the BSS.
Rerouting procedure is a mechanism used as part of the assignment of CN
operator in shared networks with MOCN configuration when they perform initial
attach/registration. In this case BSS may not know towards which MSC to route
the initial MS request message and the latter may be rerouted to another MSC
by BSS.
More precisely, in case of MOCN configuration, the selection of MSC in BSS is
based on the NRI (valid or invalid) or by random selection. In case where the
MSC cannot be deduced from the NRI and a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST initial
layer 3 message shall be transferred in COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION message
towards an MSC, BSC shall choose an MSC and initiate a rerouting procedure.
To trigger a rerouting procedure in MOCN configuration, the BSS adds the
Redirect Attempt Flag to the COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION, in order to
indicate that the MSC supporting MOCN shall respond with a REROUTE COMMAND
message or a REROUTE COMPLETE message.
#### 3.1.32.2 Reroute command
If the MSC cannot serve the request and reroute is possible (error causes are
related to subscription options - defined in [6]), the reject Layer 3
Information (e.g.Location Updating Reject) shall be included in the REROUTE
COMMAND message for the downlink direction.
When the IMSI is not included in the COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION message and
CS/PS domain registration coordination is required (see [52]), the Initial
Layer 3 Information shall be included in the REROUTE COMMAND message for the
downlink direction and Reroute Reject Cause shall be set to \"CS/PS domain
registration coordination required\". CS/PS domain registration coordination
may not be performed for the operator's own subscribers by the MSC.
In addition the REROUTE COMMAND shall contain:
\- The Initial Layer 3 Information received from the MS;
\- The Reroute _Reject Cause_ ;
\- The _Send Sequence Numbe_ r, if available;
\- The IMSI, if available.
The REROUTE COMMAND message shall always be followed by a CLEAR COMMAND
message, which is also the case when CS/PS domain registration coordination is
required and a new Initial MS Message could be initiated towards the same MSC.
At reception of the CLEAR COMMAND message received from the MSC which is not
the last attempted, no radio resources are released.
In MOCN configuration, if the BSC receives the REROUTE COMMAND message from an
MSC which is not the last attempted, it shall initiate the Initial MS Message
procedure towards another CN operator when possible (or possibly to the same
CN in case when CS/PS domain registration coordination is required), with the
following additional information in the COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION message:
\- Redirect Attempt Flag
\- The _Send Sequence Numbe_ r, if received from previously attempted CN
operator;
\- IMSI, if received from one of previously attempted CN operators.
Upon reception of the downlink REROUTE COMMAND message, the BSC shall store as
part of the Rerouting Function the associated Reroute _Reject Cause_ and
_Layer 3 Information_ related to this MSC. In case the Reroute _Reject Cause_
is set to \"CS/PS domain registration coordination required\", then the BSC
shall perform CS/PS domain registration coordination based on the received
IMSI. In this case the Reroute _Reject Cause_ value and the associated _Layer
3 Information_ shall not be stored.
In case all attempted CN operators have replied with REROUTE COMMAND message,
the BSC shall select the most appropriate Layer 3 Information received from
the attempted CN nodes based on the stored information as part of the
Rerouting procedure and send it back to the MS (see [6]).
#### 3.1.32.3 Reroute complete
If the MSC can serve the request, the Layer 3 Information (e.g.Location
Updating Accept) shall be sent to the mobile station as a DTAP message and the
REROUTE COMPLETE message with the reroute complete outcome IE set to \"MS is
accepted\" or \"MS is already registered\" shall be sent to the BSS to
complete the Rerouting procedure.
Upon reception of the downlink REROUTE COMPLETE message, the BSC shall
terminate the Rerouting procedure.
#### 3.1.32.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the MSC cannot serve the request and rerouting is not possible, the MSC
shall send to the mobile station the DTAP layer 3 information (e.g Location
Updating Reject) message and the MSC shall send to the BSS the REROUTE
COMPLETE message with the reroute complete outcome IE set to \"MS is not
accepted\".
### 3.1.33 Local Call Local Switch
#### 3.1.33.1 General
Local Call Local Switch (LCLS) provides the capability for the user plane to
be locally switched within the BSS for calls that are generated and terminated
by users served by the same BSS (see 3GPP TS 23.284).
#### 3.1.33.2 Local switch establishment
##### 3.1.33.2.1 Call Leg Correlation
Call Leg Correlation is the process of determining if another call leg exists
in the BSS with the same Global Call Reference (GCR) value. The BSS may
perform call leg correlation in a number of steps as described in 3GPP TS
23.284.\ If the BSS receives the LCLS-Correlation-Not-Needed IE in the
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message during the assignment procedure (see sub-clause
3.1.1), it may act upon this and just store the GCR value, or it may ignore
the LCLS-Correlation-Not-Needed IE and perform a full call leg correlation.
If the BSS successfully correlates two call legs it shall indicate this to the
core network by setting the LCLS-BSS-Status IE to \"Call not yet locally
switched\". If the call leg correlation is not successful the BSS shall return
the LCLS-BSS-Status IE with \"Call not possible to be locally switched\".
##### 3.1.33.2.2 Successful Operation
The BSS may only establish local switching when following conditions are met:
\- the BSS has successfully correlated two call legs, see sub-clause
3.1.33.2.1.
\- the BSS has received LCLS-Configuration IE on both call legs of the local
call, and the requested LCLS configuration is supported in the BSS.
\- the BSS has received LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE with value
\"Connect\" on both call legs of the local call.
The LCLS-Configuration IE defines the user data connectivity for the given
call leg as follows:
\- if the LCLS configuration requested by the MSC indicates \"Connect both-
way\", then the BSS shall pass user data between the locally switched call
legs without sending any user data to the core network or expecting to receive
any user data from the core network.
\- if the LCLS configuration requested by the MSC indicates \"Connect both-way
and bi-cast UL to the core network\", then the BSS shall pass user data
between the locally switched call legs and send UL user data to the core
network but not expect to receive any user data from the core network.
\- if the LCLS configuration requested by the MSC indicates \"Connect both-way
and send access DL from the core network\", then the BSS shall pass user data
between the locally switched call legs, detect incoming user data from the
core network and insert the user data into the user data stream towards the
served user. Any local DL user data received may be pre-empted while
delivering DL user data from the core network. How this is performed is
implementation dependent. The BSS shall not send UL user data to the core
network.
\- if the LCLS configuration requested by the MSC indicates \"Connect both-way
and send access DL from the core network, block local DL user data\", then the
BSS shall send user data to the locally switched call leg and pass incoming
user data from the core network towards the served user while blocking local
DL user data. The BSS shall not send UL user data to the core network.
\- if the LCLS configuration requested by the MSC indicates \"Connect both-way
and bi-cast UL to the core network with send access DL from the core
network\", then the BSS shall pass user data between the locally switched call
legs, detect incoming user data from the core network and insert the user data
into the user data stream towards the served user and send UL user data to the
core network. Any local DL user data received may be pre-empted while
delivering DL user data from the core network. How this is performed is
implementation dependent.
\- if the LCLS configuration requested by the MSC indicates \"Connect both-way
and bi-cast UL to the core network with send access DL from the core network,
block local DL user data\", then the BSS shall send user data UL both to the
core network and to the locally switched call leg and pass incoming user data
from the core network towards the served user while blocking local DL user
data.
The BSS shall inform the MSC of a successful local switch connection by
setting the LCLS-BSS-Status IE to \"Call is locally switched with requested
LCLS configuration\" in the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL-ACK message or in the
appropriate BSSAP message (see sub-clause 3.1.1, 3.1.5, 3.1.6 and 3.1.7). The
BSS shall also inform the MSC serving the other call leg of the locally
switched call using the LCLS-NOTIFICATION message, see sub-clause 3.1.33.5.
If at any time the LCLS connection status for a call leg is changed in the
BSS, the new LCLS connection status value shall be reported to the MSC
according to sub-clause 3.1.33.5.
##### 3.1.33.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
If a message which includes LCLS-Configuration IE is received in the BSS, the
BSS shall check whether it can support the requested LCLS configuration. If
the BSS does not support the requested LCLS configuration, then the BSS shall
indicate this to the MSC by setting the LCLS-BSS-Status IE to \"Requested LCLS
configuration is not supported\" in the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL-ACK message or in
the appropriate BSSAP response message (see sub-clause 3.1.1 and 3.1.5).
However, even if the BSS does not support the requested LCLS configuration the
BSS shall store the received GCR value (or replace the previously stored GCR
value) included in the Global Call Reference IE since the MSC may renegotiate
the LCLS configuration without re-sending the Global Call Reference IE.
If the MSC has granted the permission to apply local switching, the BSS makes
the final decision whether or not to establish local switching. If the BSS is
not able to establish local switching it shall indicate this to the MSC by
setting the LCLS-BSS-Status IE to value \"Call not yet locally switched\" in
the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL-ACK message or in the appropriate BSSAP message (see
sub-clause 3.1.1, 3.1.5, 3.1.6 and 3.1.7).
#### 3.1.33.3 Local switch break
##### 3.1.33.3.1 Local switching break request from MSC
If the MSC initiates break of local switching, the MSC sends the LCLS-CONNECT-
CONTROL message with the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to \"Release
LCLS\" on both call legs of the locally switched call.
On receipt of the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL message with the LCLS-Connection-
Status-Control IE set to \"Release LCLS\" the BSS shall only break local
switching if the message is received on both call legs of the locally switched
call. At reception of the LCLS break request for the first call leg (i.e.
before the LCLS break request is received for the second call leg) the BSS
shall report to the MSC by sending the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL-ACK message with
the present LCLS connection status value included in the message. At reception
of the LCLS break request for the second call leg (and a corresponding LCLS
break request is already received for the first call leg associated to the
locally switched call), the BSS shall break local switching and report the
LCLS disconnection to the MSC by sending the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL-ACK message
on this call leg, and the LCLS-NOTIFICATION message on the other call leg (see
sub-clause 3.1.33.5), with the LCLS-BSS-Status IE set to \"Call is no longer
locally switched\" included in both messages.
##### 3.1.33.3.2 Local switching break initiated by BSS
If the BSS determines that local switching should be disconnected, the BSS
may:
\- immediately break local switching and then inform the MSC on both call legs
by sending the LCLS-NOTIFICATION message (see sub-clause 3.1.33.5) with the
LCLS-BSS-Status IE set to \"Call is no longer locally switched\" included in
the message, or
\- first request the MSC to prepare for LCLS break (see sub-clause 3.1.33.5)
and on the reception of LCLS break request on both call legs the BSS breaks
local switching, see sub-clause 3.1.33.3.1.
##### 3.1.33.3.3 Local Switching break at Handover
If a call is locally switched and an inter-BSS handover or an inter-system
handover is performed for one of the call legs then local switching is broken
and normal core network switched user plane is resumed. The locally switched
call may also be broken as a result of an internal handover within the BSS.
When, during the handover procedure, the BSS receives the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL
message with the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to \"Bi-cast UL at
Handover\", the BSS shall acknowledge the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL message with
LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL-ACK and initiate UL user data transmission to this call
leg in addition to sending user data to the other locally switched call leg.
The BSS shall continue to send user data to the other locally switched call
leg until local switching is released.
When, during the handover procedure, the BSS receives the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL
message with the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE set to \"Bi-cast UL and
receive DL data at Handover\", the BSS shall acknowledge the LCLS-CONNECT-
CONTROL message with LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL-ACK, continue to send user data UL
both to the core network and to the other locally switched call leg, and if
the BSS is unable to detect inband user data itself, receive user data DL from
the core network originating from the MS in the new cell.
NOTE: Inband detection of user data from the core network is not standardised
and can only be ensured through proprietary common solutions between the core
network and the BSS.
When the locally switched call is released, the BSS shall for the call leg not
being part in the handover procedure revert to the previously defined LCLS
connection status value requested by the MSC (i.e. which was valid before
receiving the LCLS-CONNECT-CONTROL message with the LCLS-Connection-Status-
Control IE set to \"Bi-cast UL at Handover\") and maintain the LCLS
configuration setting to be able to resume local switching if e.g. the distant
call leg (in case of an inter-BSS or an inter-system handover) performs a
subsequent handover back to the same BSS.
A locally switched call may be resumed as a result of the MS returning to the
old channel at handover failure (see sub-clauses 3.1.5.3.2, 3.1.5a.4 and
3.1.5c.2.1). If the radio interface HANDOVER FAILURE message is received after
the BSS has started UL user data transmission to the core network, then the
BSS shall autonomously stop the UL transmission, end user data reception DL
from the core network (if active) and revert to the previously defined LCLS
connection status value which was valid prior to the handover.
Bi-casting of user data, which may have been activated prior to the handover
with the LCLS-Configuration IE, shall still be applied if local switching is
resumed after the handover failure.
#### 3.1.33.4 Local switch prevention
The MSC may at any time prevent the BSS from establishing local switching by
setting the LCLS-Connection-Status-Control IE to \"Do not connect\".
#### 3.1.33.5 LCLS Notification
When the LCLS connection status is changed in the BSS for a call leg for which
the BSS has reported that it supports the LCLS configuration requested from
the MSC, the new LCLS connection status value shall be explicitly reported to
the MSC in the LCLS-NOTIFICATION message (unless the changed LCLS connection
status can be returned in another BSSAP response message). Valid LCLS
connection status values are defined in sub-clause 3.2.2.119.
In the event of disconnecting local switching in the BSS, a request for LCLS
break may be sent to the MSC. The BSS sends the LCLS-NOTIFICATION message to
the MSC on both call legs with the LCLS-Break-Request IE present in the
message.
## 3.2 Message Formats and Coding
This sub-clause defines the coding and format of the messages required for the
BSSMAP.
For each message there is, in sub-clause 3.2.1, a table listing the signalling
elements in their order of appearance in the transmitted message.
There is no general rule for the order of signalling elements: it happens that
the same elements appear in various orders depending on the message.
All the BSSMAP messages are listed in the following table.

### 3.2.1 Message Contents
#### 3.2.1.1 ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
This message is sent from the MSC to the BSS via the relevant SCCP connection
in order to request the BSS to assign radio resource(s), the attributes of

The VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT STATUS message is sent from the BSS to the MSC via the
VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP connection in order to indicate to the MSC
for each cell belonging to a group call area that is controlled by this SCCP
connection, whether the radio resources for the indicated cells have been
assigned, not assigned/released or optionally waiting to be established.
In the case of A-interface link sharing, one or more instances of the message
are sent after expiry of timer Tast if there is a change in the channel
allocation for this group call. Timer Tast shall be re-started each time it
expires until the A-interface link is released. The message shall be sent
immediately when the group call is established in all cells for the first
time.
In the case of group call re-establishment by the BSS and no A-interface link
sharing, the message is sent if there is a change in the channel allocation.

### 3.2.2 Signalling element coding
#### 3.2.2.0 General
This sub-clause contains the coding of the signalling elements used.
The following conventions are assumed for the sequence of transmission of bits
and bytes:
\- Each bit position is marked as 1 to 8. Bit 1 is the least significant bit
and is transmitted first;
\- In an element octets are identified by number, octet 1 is transmitted
first, then octet 2, etc.
When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values
progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least significant
bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest
numbered octet of the field.
\- For variable length elements a length indicator is included, this indicates
the number of octets following in the element;
\- All fields within Information Elements are mandatory unless otherwise
specified. The Information Element Identifier shall always be included.
All spare bits are set to 0.

#### 3.2.2.2 Circuit Identity Code
This element defines the terrestrial channel over which the call will pass.
If a 2 048 kbits/s digital path is used then the circuit identification code
contains in the five least significant bits a binary representation of the
actual number of the timeslot which is assigned to the circuit. The remaining
bits in the CIC are used where necessary to identify one among several systems
interconnecting an originating and destination point.
The element is 2 octets in length:
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Element identifier octet 1  
a b c d e f g h octet 2 i j k X X X X X octet 3
* * *
a-k defines the PCM multiplex in use.
XXXXX define the actual timeslot in use.
The circuit identity code defines the PCM multiplex and timeslot in use at the
MSC. In cases where remultiplexing takes place between the MSC and BSS a
translation may be necessary at the BSS.
If a 1544 kbit/s digital path is used, then the format of the circuit identity
code (CIC) shall be as shown below:
The element is 2 octets in length:
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Element identifie octet 1  
CIC (least significant bits) octet 2  
CIC (most significant bits) octet 3
* * *
#### 3.2.2.3 Connection Release Requested
The element has a fixed length of one octet.
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Element identifier octet 1
* * *
#### 3.2.2.4 Resource Available
This element gives the number of full and half rate channels available on any
given cell at the time of construction of the message.
It defines these parameters in terms of the number of channels available in
five interference bands, the boundaries of these bands being set by O and M as
follows:
Interference level: 0 \---------------------------
Band 1
X1 ---------------------------
Band 2
X2 ---------------------------
Band 3
X3 ---------------------------
Band 4
X4 ---------------------------
Band 5
X5 ---------------------------
The element is coded as follows:
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Element identifier octet 1  
Number of full rate octet 2  
channels available in band 1 octet 3  
Number of half rate octet 4  
channels available in band 1 octet 5  
Number of full rate octet 18  
channels available in band 5 octet 19  
Number of half rate octet 20  
channels available in band 5 octet 21
* * *
Octets (2, 3, 4, 5) are then repeated for each of the other interference bands
giving a total message length of 21 octets.
Octets 2 and 3 give a 16 bit binary representation of the number of full rate
channels available for service but not currently assigned.
Octets 4 and 5 give a 16 bit binary representation of the number of half rate
channels available for service but not currently assigned. This will include
half rate channels already counted in octets 2 and 3, if these correspond to
full rate channels that can be used as half rate channels.
(e.g. If there is a spare half rate channel and a spare full rate channel that
can be used as two half rate channels, then the full rate count will be 1 and
the half rate count will be 3).
Octets 3 and 5 are the least significant octets, and bit 1 is the least
significant bit.
#### 3.2.2.5 Cause
The cause element is used to indicate the reason for a particular event to
have occurred and is coded as shown below.
The cause value is a single octet element if the extension bit (bit 8) is set
to 0. If it is set to 1 then the cause value is a 2 octet field. If the value
of the first octet of the cause field is 1XXX 0000 then the second octet is
reserved for national applications (XXX will still indicate the class).
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Element identifier octet 1  
Length octet 2  
0/1 ext Cause Value octet 3  
(octet 4)
* * *
The length indicator is a binary representation of the length of the following
element.
Cause Value:
Class (000): Normal event
Class (001): Normal event
Class (010): Resource unavailable
Class (011): Service or option not available, but implemented
Class (100): Service or option not implemented or currently disabled, i.e. not
supported
Class (101): invalid message (eg parameter out of range)
Class (110): protocol error
Class (111): interworking
In the following table, \"reserved for international use\" means that this
codepoint should not be used until a meaning has been assigned to it following
the process of international standardisation. \"Reserved for national use\"
indicates codepoints that may be used by operators without the need for
international standardization.

All other values of permitted speech version identifiers are for future use.
If an unknown value is received and more than one octet 5 is received the
sender expects the receiver to behave as if it has made a choice of speech
version.
The rules for coding preferences in octet 5, 5a - 5h are the following:
\- In those cases when one specific channel rate is indicated in octet 4, the
non-empty set of permitted speech versions is included. Within this set the
permitted speech versions are included in order of speech version preferences.
\- In those cases when a preference for a channel rate is indicated in octet
4, the non-empty sets of permitted speech versions for the respective channel
rate are included in order of the channel rate preferences indicated in octet
4. Within a set of permitted speech versions for a channel rate, the permitted
speech versions are included in order of speech version preferences.
\- In those cases when no preference or specific channel rate is indicated in
octet 4, the permitted speech versions are included in order of speech version
preferences.
Always octet 5 has the highest preference followed by octet 5a and so on. For
each channel rate allowed by octet 4 at least one speech version shall be
present.
If octet 5 indicates no extension and bits 7-1 is coded \"000 0001\", then the
preference is interpreted based upon the octet 4 value as follows:
\- in those cases when octet 4 indicates one specific channel rate, then
\"speech version 1\" for the indicated channel rate is permitted;
\- in those cases when octet 4 indicates a preference for a channel rate, then
\"speech version 1\" for any of the allowed channel rates is permitted;
\- in those cases when octet 4 does neither indicate a preference for a
channel rate nor a specific channel rate, then \"speech version 1\" for any of
the allowed channel rates is permitted and speech full rate version 1 is
preferred.
If octet 3 indicates data, and octet 4 does not indicate multislot
configuration, then octet 5 shall be coded as follows:
+-----+-------------+----------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+ | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | | +-----+-------------+----------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+ | ext | T/NT | Rate | octet 5 | | | | | | +-----+-------------+----------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+ | ext | allowed | octet 5a | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | r i/f rates | | | | | | | | +-----+-------------+----------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+ | ext | asymmetry | spare | octet 5b | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | indication | | | | | | | | +-----+-------------+----------+----------+---+---+---+---+---+
Bit 8 indicates extension of octet 5.

#### 3.2.2.14 Total Resource Accessible
This element gives the total number of full and half rate channels accessible
on any given cell at the time of construction of the message.
It defines these parameters in terms of the number of channels which are
accessible or in use. No separation between the defined interference bands is
made.
The element is coded as follows:
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Element identifier octet 1
Total number of accessible full rate channels octet 2\  
octet 3
Total number of accessible half rate channels octet 4\  
octet 5
* * *
Octets 2 and 3 give a 16 bit binary representation of the total number of full
rate channels accessible (i.e. available for service or currently assigned).
Octets 4 and 5 give a 16 bit binary representation of the number of half rate
channels accessible (i.e. available for service or currently assigned). This
will include half rate channels already counted in octets 2 and 3, if these
correspond to full rate channels that can be used as half rate channels.
(eg. If there is an accessible half rate channel and an accessible full rate
channel that can be used as two half rate channels, then the full rate count
will be 1 and the half rate count will be 3).
Octets 3 and 5 are the least significant octets, and bit 1 is the least
significant bit.

#### 3.2.2.27a Cell Identifier List Segment
In the VGCS/VBS Assignment procedure, the entire list of cells in the group
call area is communicated to the BSS in one VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message and a sequence of (N) VGCS/VBS AREA CELL INFO messages (each message
containing one CELL Identifier List Segment IE). The CELL Identifier List
Segment IE is coded as follows:
+-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Element identifier | octet 1 | | | | | | | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Length | octet 2 | | | | | | | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Sequence Length | Sequence Number | octet 3 | | | | | | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Spare | Cell identification | octet 4 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | discriminator | | | | | | | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Cell identification 1 | octet 5 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | to | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | octet 4+nm | | | | | | | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | ... | | | | | | | | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | Cell identification n | | | | | | | | | +-----------------------+---------------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
Octet 2 is a binary indication of the length of the remainder of the element
in octets.
Octet 3 bits 1-4 represent the sequence number (i), 0 being the sequence
number of the segment carried in the VGCS/VBS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, 1 to
N the sequence numbers of the segments carried in the following VGCS/VBS AREA
CELL INFO messages.
Octet 3 bits 5-8 represent the Sequence Number (N) of the last segment to be
sent.
Octet 4 bits 1-4, contains the Cell Identification Discriminator that is used
for the cell identifiers in this Cell Identifier List Segment. The coding of
the Cell identification discriminator is a binary number indicating if the
whole or a part of Cell Global identification, CGI, according to 3GPP TS
23.003 is used for cell identification of the cells in the list. The Cell
identification discriminator is coded as follows:
0000 The whole Cell Global Identification, CGI, is used to identify the cells
0001 Location Area Code, LAC, and Cell Identify, CI, is used to identify the
cells within a given MCC and MNC
0010 Cell Identity, CI, is used to identify the cells within a given MCC and
MNC and LAC
0011 No cell is associated with the transaction
0100 Location Area Identification, LAI, is used to identify all cells within a
Location Area
0101 Location Area Code, LAC, is used to identify all cells within a location
area
0110 All cells on the BSS are identified
0111 MCC and MNC, is used to identify all cells within the given MCC and MNC
All other values are reserved.
Octet 5-4+nm contains the Cell Identification List. The coding of the Cell
Identification List depends on the Cell identification discriminator (octet
4). Below is the coding of the Cell Identification List and the i-th Cell
Identification is shown for each Cell identification discriminator (with \"i\"
in the range 1 to n):
NOTE: No coding is specified for Cell identification discriminator values of

The Number of channels is a single octet element if the 7/15 indication bit
(bit 8 of octets 4, 6, etc.) is set to 0. If the 7/15 indication bit is set to
1 then it is a 2 octet field. It give a 7 (or 15) bit binary representation of
the number of channels with resource type as indicated in the nearest
preceding resource type octet. The coding convention used when a field extends
over more than one octet is defined in sub-clause 3.2.2.
The number of half rate channels will include half rate channels counted as
full rate channels, if these correspond to full rate channels that can be used
as half rate channels.
(e.g. If there is one idle half rate channel and one idle full rate channel
that can be used as two half rate channels, then the full rate count will be 1
and the half rate count will be 3).
The Resource type octet and the Number of channels octet(s) are repeated for
each of the resource type reported.
For each of the channel type reported, the total number of channels accessible
and at least one indication of available channels shall be included.
The number of channels available without supplied interference band
classification is included only in case the interference band definition is
not available for the reported channel type.

The length indicator (octet 2) is a binary number indicating the absolute
length of the contents after the length indicator. The length depends on the
number and type of Speech Codec Elements to be included. The minimum length of
one Speech Codec Element is 1 octet and the maximum length is 3 octets. The
maximum number of Speech Codec Elements within the Speech Codec List is not
defined.
The coding of one \"Speech Codec Element\" is in general:
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
FI PI PT TF Codec Type octet z m  
Extended Codec Type octet z+1 c  
Configuration octet z+2 c  
Configuration octet z+3 c
* * *
The \"Codec Type\" field specifies the Codec Type for the radio interface. It
may contain a certain 3GPP Speech Codec Type directly (see below) or it may
contain the so called \"Codec Extension\" = 0xFh, in which case the real Codec
Type follows in the next octet as \"Extended Codec Type\". This extension
mechanism is necessary in order to allow more than 16 different Codec Types in
future. None, one or two \"Configuration\" octets may follow after the
\"(Extended) Codec Type\" octet, depending on the specified Codec Type. Each
Codec Type is in addition associated with 4 bits to specify the A-Interface
Type and the transcoder resource location (FI = \"full IP\", PI = \"PCM over
IP\", PT = \"PCM over TDM\", TF = \"TFO Flag\").
In order to support also Circuit Switched Data and Fax services a so called
\"CSData Codec\" is used, see below.
This "Speech Codec List" Information Element is used for \"Codec List (BSS
Supported)\" and \"Codec List (MSC Preferred)\".
Each Speech Codec Element in a Speech Codec List contains a Codec Type,
supported on the radio interface by the BSS (in the \"Codec List (BSS
Supported)\") or preferred (on the radio interface) by the MSC (in the \"Codec
List (MSC Preferred)\").
The \"**Codec List (BSS Supported)** \" contains all the codecs for which the
BSS wants to indicate support, not depending on the \"**Codec List (MSC
Preferred)** \" and the MS capabilities. The \"**Codec List (BSS Supported)**
\" is not in priority order and may include any number of Codec Types and any
number of Codec Configurations per Codec Type and any A-Interface Type per
Codec Type. The same Codec Type can be listed more than once, e.g. for AMR
Codec Types, to indicate TFO/TrFO support for some combinations of AMR
configurations and A-Interface Types only. The mandatory GSM_FR may be
excluded from the list (e.g. in overload conditions, when half rate Codecs are
preferred).
The \"**Codec List (MSC Preferred)** \" contains all the codecs for which the
MSC wants to indicate support, by taking into account BSS and MS capabilities
as well. This is the list of codecs allowed by the MSC for this assignment or
handover (see [51] for more information). The \"**Codec List (MSC Preferred)**
\" may include codecs that are not included in the \"**Codec List (BSS
Supported)** \". The \"**Codec List (MSC Preferred)** \" shall not include
codecs that are not supported by the MS. The codecs in the \"**Codec List (MSC
Preferred)** \" shall be listed in priority order as set by the MSC, with the
most preferred Codec Type first (e.g. the one that may enable TrFO or TFO).
The \"**Codec List (MSC Preferred)** \" may contain any number of Codec Types
and any number of Codec Configurations per Codec Type and any A-Interface Type
per Codec Type. If more than one A-Interface Type is indicated for one Codec
Type, then FI has higher priority than PI and this has higher priority than
PT, see below. The same Codec Type can be listed more than once, e.g. it can
be included at the top of the list (most preferred Codec Type) with one Codec
Configuration or A-interface type only, and then with all the possible
configurations further down in the list. If there are no common codecs between
Codec List (BSS Supported) and the codecs supported by MS, then GSM-FR shall
always be included in the Codec List (MSC Preferred) as a default option.
**For true Speech Codec Types (not the CSData Codec Type) these four bits have
the following meaning for the A-Interface Type:**
**FI** indicates Full IP
'1' means: AoIP with compressed speech via RTP/UDP/IP is supported by the BSS
(in the \"**Codec List (BSS Supported)** \") or preferred by the MSC (in the
\"**Codec List (MSC Preferred)** \") for this Codec Type. A Transcoder
Resource is not necessary in BSS.
'0' means: Compressed speech via RTP/UDP/IP is not supported by the BSS or not
preferred by the MSC for this Codec Type.
**PI** indicates PCMoIP
'1' means: Transport of PCM over A-Interface via RTP/UDP/IP is supported by
the BSS (i.e. a Transcoder Resource may be located in BSS) or preferred by the
MSC (i.e. a Transcoder Resource needs to be located in BSS) for this (radio)
Codec Type.
'0' means: PCM over A interface with IP as transport is not supported by the
BSS or not preferred by the MSC for this Codec Type
**PT** indicates PCMoTDM
'1' means: Transport of PCM over A-Interface via TDM is supported by the BSS
(i.e. a Transcoder Resource may be located in BSS) or preferred by the MSC
(i.e. a Transcoder Resource needs to be located in BSS) for this (radio) Codec
Type.
'0' means: PCM over A-Interface with TDM as transport is not supported by the
BSS or not preferred by the MSC for this Codec Type.
**TF** indicates TFO support
'1' means: TFO supported by the BSS or TFO support is preferred by the MSC for
this Codec Type
'0' means: TFO is not supported by the BSS or TFO support is not preferred by
the MSC for this Codec Type
The TF bit is valid only if either the PI or the PT bit are set to '1' and
indicates whether the sender supports the TFO functionality for the
corresponding call. TF bits in the \"Codec List (MSC Preferred)\" do not
mandate the establishment of TFO, which may only be performed through in-band
TFO procedures.
The Codec Type is valid if at least one of FI, PI or PT is set to '1'. If the
Codec Type is not valid the Speech Codec Element shall be ignored.
**For the CSData Codec Type these four bits have the following meaning for the
A-Interface Type :**
**FI** is undefined and reserved for future use. It is coded with zero.
**PI** indicates CSDoIP
'1' means: Transport of Circuit Switched Data over the A-Interface via
RTP/UDP/IP is supported by the BSS\ or preferred by the MSC. The Rate
Adaptation Ressource needs to be located in BSS for this.
'0' means: Transport of Circuit Switched Data over A interface via RTP/UDP/IP
is not supported by the BSS\ or not preferred by the MSC.
**PT** indicates CSDoTDM
'1' means: Transport of Circuit Switched Data over the A-Interface via TDM is
supported by the BSS\ or preferred by the MSC. The Rate Adaptation Ressource
needs to be located in BSS for this.
'0' means: Transport of Circuit Switched Data over A interface via TDM is not
supported by the BSS\ or not preferred by the MSC.
**TF** is undefined and reserved for future use. It is coded with zero.
The Codec Type is valid if at least one of FI, PI or PT is set to '1'. If the
Codec Type is not valid the Speech Codec Element shall be ignored.

the BSS or preferred Codec Configurations by the MSC, see TS 28.062, Table
7.11.3.1.3-2: Preferred Configurations for the Adaptive Multi-Rate Codec
Types.
NOTE: One of these Codec Configurations, \"Config-NB-Code 1\" = S1, is
recommended for TrFO.\ \ If AMR-NB is supported for compressed speech on the
A-Interface, then Config-NB-Code 1shall be supported by BSS and Core Network
to guarantee interoperation, see also TS 26.103 [44]. The other preferred AMR-
NB Configurations (Config-NB-Code 0, 2..15) are optional.

* * *
The Codec Type and the Codec Configuration**:**
In order to reduce data loss caused by single or double lost RTP packets in IP
transport, several redundant (i.e. repeated) data blocks may be packed into
one RTP packet after this redundancy has been negotiated between BSS and MSC.
\"Redundancy Level\" is a bitmap indicating the values of the redundancy level
related to the RTP packet. \"Redundancy Level\" could be considered as the
Configuration of CSData Codec Type. This octet is always included (even if PI
= 0), although Redundancy Level is not defined for the legacy A-Interface (PT
= 1).
**R2** and **R3 indicate the support of the Redundancy Level** 2 (optional)
and 3 (optional), while support of Redundancy Level 1 (one data block is
contained in one RTP packet, i.e., no redundancy is used) is mandatory. The
redundancy levels are not depending on each other, it is for example allowed
to support redundancy level 1 and 3 without supporting redundancy level 2.
**R2** indicates Redundancy Level = 2 (two successive data blocks are
contained in one RTP packet):
'1' means: Redundancy Level = 2 is supported;
'0' means: Redundancy Level = 2 is not supported.
**R3** indicates Redundancy Level = 3 (three successive data blocks are
contained in one RTP packet):
'1' means: Redundancy Level = 3 is supported;
'0' means: Redundancy Level = 3 is not supported.
In Codec List (BSS Supported) and Codec List (MSC Preferred) more than one of
these A-Interface Types and Redundancy Levels may be flagged to allow an open
negotiation and to restrict the negotiation as far as necessary. But in
\"Speech Codec (Used)\", \"Speech Codec (Chosen)\" and \"Speech Codec (MSC
Chosen)\"exactly one A-Interface Type and exactly one Redundancy Level shall
be specified. Redundancy Level 1 is specified by flagging neither R2 nor R3.
The existing \"Channel Type\" IE contains all the other parameters for fax and
data calls. This Channel Type IE and the CSData Codec Type shall contain
consistent data.
Spare bits are reserved and coded with zeroes.
**CSData** is coded with 0xFDh or '1111 1101' (see also TS 26.103).

user plane transport) shall be indicated, i.e. only one of the bits FI, PI or
PT shall be set to 1 (see below). As an exception, in \"Speech Codec (MSC
Chosen)\", in case of AMR-NB, there can be both, FR_AMR, HR_AMR and OHR Codec
Types included and in case of AMR-WB, there can be both, FR_AMR-WB, OHR_AMR-WB
and OFR_AMR-WB Codec Types included, with the same or compatible Codec

cell, Cell identification discriminator = 0000. For a UTRAN source cell, Cell
identification discriminator = 1100.
The _Cell Load Information Group elements_ field is made up of zero or more of
the field elements listed below.
* * *
FIELD ELEMENT REFERENCE LEN Downlink Cell Load Information 3.2.3.9 8 Uplink
Cell Load Information 3.2.3.10 8
* * *
#### 3.2.3.12 Cell Load Information
This field element contains the load information of a specific (serving or
target) cell for either the Downlink or the Uplink. It is coded as follows:
* * *
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Field Element identifier octet 1  
Length octet 2  
Cell Capacity Class Value octet 3  
Load Value octet 4  
RT Load Value octet 5  
NRT Load Information Value octet 6
* * *
_Cell Capacity Class Value_ is the value that classifies the cell capacity
with regards to the other cells. It only indicates resources that are
configured for traffic purposes. _Cell Capacity Class Value_ may take binary
coded integer values from and including 1 up to and including 100. Other
values shall be considered as an error. Value 1 shall indicate the minimum
cell capacity, and 100 shall indicate the maximum cell capacity. There should
be linear relation between cell capacity and _Cell Capacity Class Value_.
_Load Value_ contains the total cell load relative to the maximum planned
load. It is defined as the load percentage of the Cell Capacity Class. _Load
Value_ may take binary coded integer values from and including 0 up to and
including 100. Other values shall be considered as an error. Value 0 shall
indicate the minimum load, and 100 shall indicate the maximum load. _Load
Value_ should be measured on a linear scale.
_RT Load Value_ indicates in percents the ratio of the load generated by Real
Time traffic relative to the measured Load Value. Real Time traffic
corresponds to the Conversational and Streaming traffic classes. _RT Load
Value_ may take binary coded integer values from and including 0 up to and
including 100. Other values shall be considered as no information.
_NRT Load Information Value_ indicates the load situation on the cell for Non
Real-Time traffic. Non Real-Time traffic corresponds to the Interactive and
Background traffic classes. _NRT Load Information Value_ may take binary coded
integer values from and including 0 up to and including 3. Other values shall
be considered as no information. The values shall be interpreted as:
Value 0: NRT load is low.
Value 1: NRT load is medium.
Value 2: NRT load is high. (Probability to admit a new user is low.)
Value 3: NRT overload. (Probability to admit a new user is low, packets are
discarded and the source is recommended to reduce the data flow.)

### 3.2.3.16 IRAT Measurement Configuration
The _IRAT Measurement Configuration_ IE is used to indicate to the BSS which
frequency measurement results of the source RAT shall be collected after a
successful inter-system handover. The _IRAT Measurement Configuration_ IE is
used by the source RAT to specify the E-UTRA frequencies for which the
corresponding EARFCN is less than 65535 to be reported back to the source RAT
(each of them associated with a measurement bandwidth), the minimum radio
quality and the period of time that the measurements should last before
triggering a _HO Report_ for unnecessary handover to another RAT.
NOTE 1: _HO Report_ is defined in 3GPP TS 36.413 [57].
NOTE 2: The functionality of Unnecessary IRAT HO is described in 3GPP TS
36.300 [59].

65536 to 262143 shall be indicated using the _IRAT Measurement Configuration
(extended E-ARFCNs)_ IE (see subclause 3.2.3.18); in such a case, E-UTRA
frequencies corresponding to E-ARFCNs in the value range from 0 to 65534
(value 65535 is reserved and shall not be used) shall be indicated using the
_IRAT Measurement Configuration_ IE.

indicate to the BSS which frequency measurement results of the source RAT
shall be collected after a successful inter-system handover. The _IRAT
Measurement Configuration_ _(extended E-ARFCNs)_ IE is used by the source RAT
to specify the E-UTRA frequencies for which the corresponding E-ARFCN is
greater than 65535 to be reported back to the source RAT (each of them
associated with a measurement bandwidth), the minimum radio quality and the
period of time that the measurements should last before triggering a _HO

## 3.3 SDL Representation Of The Procedures At The BSS
The SDL diagrams may be inserted at a later stage after updating and carefully
checking of consistency with the main text.
# 4 Broadcast Information Control Channel
Information that is transferred in the Broadcast Control Channel is stored
locally at the BSS. The scheduling of this information on the BCCH is
controlled autonomously by the BSS.
The set of information that is transmitted in the BCCH is derived locally or
downloaded to the BSS via the BSS Operation and Maintenance Application Part.
# 5 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Base Station System (BSS):** equipment which is accessed through the
interface defined in the 3GPP TS 08‑series.\ It contains the functionality
described in 3GPP TS 48.002, and supports one or more cells. See 3GPP TS
41.004.
**Base Station System Application Part (BSSAP):** subsystem that contains the
process dealing with radio resource control and management known as the Base
Station System Management Application Part (BSSMAP) and transparent transfer
of call control and mobility management information known as the Direct
Transfer Application Part (DTAP). The BSSAPs at the BSS and the MSC are
connected by means of SCCP connections.
**Base Station System Management Application Part (BSSMAP):** process within
the BSS that controls radio resources in response to instructions from the
MSC.
**cell load based handover:** takes place in order to avoid congestion in the
old cell by handing traffic off to another cell, typically less loaded. A cell
load based handover is initiated with the handover cause set to \"reduce load
in serving cell\".
**directed retry:** process of assigning a Mobile Station to a TCH in a cell
other than the serving cell, e.g. in situations of congestion. It is triggered
by the assignment procedure and employs internal or external handover
procedures.
**Direct Transfer Application Part (DTAP):** process which allows the direct
transfer of messages between individual MSs and the MSC with no interpretation
of layer 3 information at the BSS.
**IP based user plane interface is supported:** The related nodes support and
can set up connections over an IP based user plane if appropriate. That is,
PCM over IP or compressed speech over IP is supported over the user plane.
**internal handover:** takes place between channels on a cell or cells
controlled by a single BSS. This handover operates without reference to the
MSC (although the MSC will be informed on completion). Handovers of this type
in one cell are called internal intra cell handovers and between cells are
called internal inter cell handovers.
Handovers between channels on the same cell or between cells on the same BSS
which are controlled by the MSC are external handovers and use identical
procedures to those for inter-BSS handovers.
**intersystem handover:** takes place between different radio access systems
(e.g. GSM BSS and UTRAN or GSM BSS and cdma2000 RAN or GSM BSS and E-UTRAN (CS
to PS SRVCC to E-UTRAN)).
**Terrestrial resource** : Resource related to a TDM or an IP based connection
for the user plane.
**VGCS/VBS call controlling SCCP connection:** is an SCCP connection which
supports the signalling for call SETUP of a VGCS/VBS call and the signalling
for uplink control of a VGCS call. One of these connections is needed to
support each instance of a VGCS/VBS call within a BSS.
**VGCS/VBS resource controlling SCCP connection:** is an SCCP connection which
supports the allocation of resources for a VGCS/VBS call. One or more of these
connections is needed to support each instance of a VGCS/VBS call. The exact
number of these SCCP connections is equal to the number of cells to which the
VGCS/VBS call is to be supported or in case of A-interface sharing equal to
the number of BSCs involved in the VGCS/VBS call.
