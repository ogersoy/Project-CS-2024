# Introduction
Mobile telephony devices and voice services continue to develop and evolve and
their associated minimum performance requirements and test methodologies also
need to stay relevant and representative of quality demands.
While many advances were made in Rel. 11 to the acoustic requirements and test
specifications in TS 26.131 and TS 26.132 many items therein were left marked
"for further study" and require a final decision by SA4. Additionally, there
are new acoustic requirements and emerging tests we may wish to consider in a
future release, but require further study before incorporation to our
specifications.
This technical report will, first and foremost, address the remaining items
presently designated as "for further study" in TS 26.131 and TS 26.132.
This report will also examine opportunities for new acoustic tests and
requirements that help us to better characterise the UE acoustic experience,
opportunities to replace existing test methods with others that are more
accurate or more efficient and make specific recommendations for their
inclusion in existing or new specifications.
# 1 Scope
The scope of this study is to investigate, first and foremost, the existing
items presently designated as "for further study" in TS 26.131 and TS 26.132.
The investigation will additionally identify, examine and evaluate
opportunities for new acoustic tests and requirements that better help
characterise the UE acoustic experience, opportunities to replace existing
test methods with others that are more accurate or more efficient and to make
specific recommendations for their incorporation inclusion in existing or new
specifications.
While many advances were made in Rel 11 to the acoustic requirements and test
specifications in TS 26.131 and TS 26.132 many items therein were left marked
"for further study" and require a final disposition by SA4 including
  * NB & WB Stability loss, Headset UE (TS 26.131 Sections 5.6 & 6.6)
  * NB & WB Delay, Wireless Headset (TS 26.131 Section 5.12.2.2 & 6.11.2.2)
  * NB & WB Echo control ("double-talk") characteristics (TS 26.131 Sections 5.13 &6.12, TS 26.132 Section 8.11)
    * Handset, Headset, Handheld hands-free, Desktop and vehicle mounted hands-free are all marked FFS
  * NB& WB Free-field measurements for vehicle-mounted hands-free (TS 26.132 Section 7.2.3 & 8.2.3)
  * NB & WB Idle Channel Noise, Sending/Receiving of test signal (TS 26.132 Section 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 8.3.1 & 8.3.2 )
Additionally, there are new acoustic requirements and emerging tests that may
be considered in a future release, but require further study before
incorporation to our specifications. It has been anticipated that topics in
this area would include, but would not be limited to, an evaluation of
  * Time-variant user behaviour
  * Additional UE usage environments
  * New or refined test methods for existing requirements
  * Acceptance of updates (if any) to existing ETSI and ITU-T dependencies
Coordination with other SDOs, such as ITU-T SG 12 and ETSI STQ among others,
is also reported.

### 4.3 [NB & WB Echo control ("double-talk") characteristics]
### 4.3.1 Results from a study on NB Echo control ("double-talk")
characteristics using P.835 methodology
#### 4.3.1.1 Background
In Release 11 of TS26.132, new methods for evaluation of echo control
characteristics were introduced, Clauses 7.11 and 8.11. However, corresponding
requirements were not defined in TS26.131.
A subjective listening test based on methods from Recommendation ITU-T P.835
was conducted in order to provide some data for purposes of investigating
possible requirements.
Instead of a conversational test, or talking and listening test, this report
provides results from listening only test, so participants did not experience
echo while talking, only while passively listening. Below are presented
results of the subjective evaluation of real speech double talk test, for 12
devices, in both handset and handheld speakerphone for narrow band.
#### 4.3.1.2 Test Method & Results
##### 4.3.1.2.1 Methods
The categories defined in Clauses 7.11, Figure 17b5, (copied below for
convenience) and Table 2c, and 8.11, Figure 19b5, and Table 2g, are described
in perceptually-relevant terms.

for echo canceller performance are compared to the subjective ratings reported
in 4.3.1.2.2. In addition to the categories and levels from TS 26.132, two
additional metrics are considered. The first is found in Recommendation ITU-T
P.502, revised Amendment III [xx], defining a method for computing the
attenuation in the sending direction under double-talk conditions, A~s,DT~.
The second is found in Recommendation ITU-T P.863 [xx]. While the application
to impairments resulting from double-talk is not explicitly within scope of
P.863, it has been used for this purpose in some instances.
#### 4.3.2.1.1 Method for P.863 computations
For P.863 computations, guidance from P.863.1 clause was followed. The four
sentences of segment 2 of the double-talk test signal from TS 26.132 were
grouped sequentially into two sentence-pairs. The reference signal for the
P.863 NB mode was the full-band source, filtered by a NB filter according to
P.863.1 Table 3. The reference signal for the P.863 SWB mode was the full band
source, filtered by a SWB filter according to P.863.1 Table 3. The validation
tests defined in P.863.1 clause 8.8 were passed, with both sentence-pair
references scoring 4.50 for MOS-LQOn and 4.75 for MOS-LQOw. For each test
condition, the P.863 scores MOS-LQOn and MOS-LQOw were computed using the
uplink measurements from that test condition, grouped into two sentence-pairs.
The MOS-LQOn and MOS-LQOw for the test condition are reported as the average
of the scores for each of the two sentence-pairs from the measurements for
that condition.
#### 4.3.2.2 Comparison of metrics to subjective SIG ratings
Table 1 contains summary values for the fit of the above-described metrics to
the SIG DT ratings for both HS and HHHF combined.
