# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies measurable performance requirements for
signalling aspects of Mobile Stations (MS)s. To allow implementation
flexibility it has been chosen to specify requirements on the whole Mobile
Station rather than to specify requirements on each \"OSI layer\". As a
consequence the performance requirements do not fit conveniently in
specifications such as 3GPP TS 24.008 [4] and 3GPP TS 44.018 [4a] (layer 3
only) or 3GPP TS 44.006 [3] (layer 2 only).
The main aim of the present document is to provide the justification for
testing of requirements that are not included in other GSM specifications.
Where specific requirements are included in other GSM specifications they are
not duplicated here.
MSs have to perform a wide variety of functions. As a consequence most
performance measurements have to be made under a set of defined conditions:
where necessary, these are included in the present document.
Where necessary certain assumptions are made about the interaction times
between the mobile equipment and the SIM. If the (test) SIM does not respond
within the assumed time then appropriate allowances shall be made.
Additionally, it is intended that the present document should contain
sufficient requirements to enable some undefined network timers in 3GPP TS
24.008 [4] and 3GPP TS 44.018 [4a] to be calculated.
