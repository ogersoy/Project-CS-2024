# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
28.704: IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Requirements
**28.705: IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information Service (IS)**
28.706: IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Solution Set (SS) definitions
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network
resource information that can be communicated between an IRPAgent and an
IRPManager for telecommunication network management purposes, including
management of converged networks.
This document specifies the semantics and behaviour of information object
class attributes and relations visible across the reference point in a
protocol and technology neutral way. It does not define their syntax and
encoding.
The IMS NRM IRP comprises a set of specifications defining Requirements, a
protocol neutral Information Service and one or more Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral IMS NRM IRP: Information
Service (IS). It reuses relevant parts of the Generic NRM IRP: IS in 3GPP TS
28.622 [9], either by direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that
defines IMS specific Information Object Classes.
Finally, in order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface
IRP is needed, such as the Basic CM IRP in 3GPP TS 32.602 [10]. However, which
Interface IRP that is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.

### 4.2.1 Relationships
This clause depicts the set of classes (e.g. IOCs) that encapsulates the
information relevant for this IRP. This clause provides the overview of the
relationships of relevant classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more
detailed specification of various aspects of these classes.The figures below
show the containment/naming hierarchy and the associations of the information
object classes defined in the present document.
NOTE: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios
in all figures.

subclassed IOC is utilized, the ASFunction relationships (including link
objects) are carried forward to the sub-classed IOC through inheritance.
