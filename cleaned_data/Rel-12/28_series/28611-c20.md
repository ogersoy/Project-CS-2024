# 1 Scope
The present document describes the Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP) requirements for the EPC and WLAN interworking system
according to the structure defined in 3GPP TS 23.402 [8] (e.g. ePDG, 3GPP AAA,
etc).
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- - References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- - For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

NRM Network Resource Model
# Concepts and background
The architectures of enhancement for non-3GPP access (i.e. WLAN) to 3GPP
system are defined in 3GPP TS 23.402 [8].\ In TS 23.402, three kinds of
architectures are defined, using S2a, S2b and S2c interface separately.\ The
architectures of S2a and S2c don\'t introduce new network elements in 3GPP
system,\ while the architecture S2b introduces a new network element to
support the interworking:
> \- evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) (clause 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [8]).
The above interworking related network element should be managed by the 3GPP
OAM, and the corresponding NRM IRP needs to be defined.
Based on the above characteristics, this specification defines the evolved
3GPP interworking WLAN NRM IRP requirements.
# 5 Requirements
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
a) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [2].
b) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
c) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 [4].
In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements apply:
**REQ-EPC_WLAN-CON-001\** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall
contain ePDG specific IOCs and related definitions.\ This requirement should
be satisfied when the S2b architecture is implemented.
**REQ-EPC_WLAN-CON-002\** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall
contain 3GPP AAA specific IOCs and related definitions.
