contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**TS 28.601: \"Telecommunication management; Core Network (CN) and non-3GPP
access interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Requirements\".**
TS 28.602: **\"** Telecommunication management; Core Network (CN) and non-3GPP
access interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)**\".**
TS 28.606: **\"** Telecommunication management; Core Network (CN) and non-3GPP
access interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions**\".**
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP) requirements for Interworking WLAN (IWLAN). According to
the structure of IWLAN defined in 3GPP TS 23.234 [6], the present document is
focusing on the definition of NRM IRP requirements on the 3GPP part (e.g. WAG,
PDG, 3GPP AAA, etc).
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply.\ An abbreviation defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR
21.905 [1].

# 4 Concepts and background
The architecture of interworking between the 3GPP system and WLAN is defined
in 3GPP TS 23.234 [6]. According to the architecture, some new network
elements or functions are introduced to support the interworking:
> \- 3GPP AAA server (proxy/server) - see clauses 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 of [6].
>
> \- WLAN Access Gateway (WAG) - see clauses 6.2.5 of [6].
>
> \- Packet Data Gateway (PDG) - see clauses 6.2.6 of [6].
>
> \- Tunnel Terminating Gateway (TTG) - see Annex F.5 of [6].
Based on the above characteristics, the present document defines the
requirements for the 3GPP/WLAN interworking Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP).
# 5 Requirements
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
a) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [2].
b) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
c) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 [4].
In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements apply:
**REQ-CN_WLAN-CON-001\** The NRM defined by this IRP shall contain WAG
specific IOCs and related definitions.
**REQ-CN_WLAN-CON-002\** The NRM defined by this IRP shall contain PDG
specific IOCs and related definitions.
**REQ-CN_WLAN-CON-003\** The NRM defined by this IRP shall contain 3GPP AAA
specific IOCs and related definitions.
