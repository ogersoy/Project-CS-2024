# Introduction
**Ready for Converged Management**
NOTE: This specification is part of a set that has been developed for
converged management solutions.
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
28.601: **\"** Telecommunication management; Core Network (CN) and non-3GPP
access interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Requirements**\";**
**28.602: \"Telecommunication management; Core Network (CN) and non-3GPP
access interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)\";**
28.606: **\"** Telecommunication management; Core Network (CN) and non-3GPP
access Interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions**\".**
The interface Itf-N, defined in 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], is built up by a number of
Integration Reference Points (IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which
realize the functional capabilities over this interface. The basic structure
of the IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and 3GPP TS
32.103 [14].
# 1 Scope
The present document is an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named \"Core
Network (CN) and non-3GPP access interworking system Network Resource Model
IRP\", through which an \'IRPAgent\' (typically an Element Manager or Network
Element) can communicate Configuration Management (CM) information to one or
several \'IRPManagers\' (typically Network Managers) concerning interworking
network resources.
According to the structure of IWLAN defined in 3GPP TS 23.234 [5], several
nodes are defined in 3GPP (e.g. WAG, PDG, 3GPP AAA, etc). The present document
is focusing on the definition of NRM IRP IOCs for management support.
It reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in 3GPP TS 28.622 [6], either by
direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that defines I-WLAN specific
Information Object Classes.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP is
needed, such as the Basic CM IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.602 [7]) or the Bulk CM IRP IS
(3GPP TS 32.612 [8]). However, which Interface IRP that is applicable is
outside the scope of the present document.
The present document supports the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM)
concept described in 3GPP TS 32.107 [16] in that the relevant Information
Object Classes (IOCs) defined in the present document are directly or
indirectly inherited from those specified in the Umbrella Information Model
(UIM) of 3GPP TS 28.620 [17].
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

### 4.2.1 Relationships
This clause depicts the set of classes (e.g. IOCs) encapsulating the
information relevant for this IRP.\ This clause provides an overview of the
relationships between relevant classes in UML.\ Subsequent clauses provide
more detailed specification of various aspects of these classes.
{width="6.002083333333333in" height="2.99375in"}
NOTE: The listed cardinality numbers, in particular the use of cardinality
number zero, do not represent transient states. The transient state is
considered an inherent property of all IOC instances and therefore there is no
need to represent them by individual IOC cardinality numbers.

### 4.2.2 Inheritance
This clause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between IOCs.
Figure 6.2.2.1 shows the inheritance hierarchy for the IWLAN NRM.
