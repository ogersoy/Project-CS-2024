# 5 Deployment scenarios
Heterogeneous network deployments aim at improving capacity and/or coverage.
For capacity, solutions are targeted to increase the network capacity in some
portions within the original Macro cell area. For coverage, solutions need to
mitigate the poor coverage in certain areas. The major scope of the
investigations in this study item is finalized to capacity improvements.
There are different deployment scenarios for heterogeneous networks, and
depending on the combination of UE serving cells, the interference environment
is different and presents different challenges.

Figure 1: Co-channel deployment scenarios
Figure 1 illustrates the co-channel deployment scenario for heterogeneous
networks.\ LPN1 is deployed within the Macro cell1 coverage and uses the same
frequency f1.\ UE1 and UE2 are served by Macro cell1.\ UE3 is positioned on
the cell edge of LPN1 and can be served by both Macro cell1 and LPN1 when both
are in the SHO active set. UE4 is only served by LPN1.

frequencies, f1 and f2.\ UE1 and UE2 use a single frequency and are served by
Macro cell1.\ UE3 is served by Macro cell1 with f1 and f2, and by LPN1 with f1
and f2.\ In this example the transmit power on both frequencies is the same.

Figure 4 illustrates the combined cell (also called shared cell) deployment
scenario.\ The LPNs deployed within the Macro cell area have the same primary
scrambling code.\ All the LPNs\' time reference is closely coupled to the
macro clock.
# 6 Aspects of heterogeneous networks
## 6.1 Interference in co-channel scenario
In co-channel scenarios the transmit power difference between the high power
Macro cells and the LPNs creates an interference environment different from
the interference in networks with all Macro cells.\ Considering that the
typical transmit power for Macro cells is 43 dBm, and for LPN can be 37dBm,
30dBm or 24dBm, a UE that receives both signals from a Macro cell and a LPN
with the same strength, generates an UL signal which is received at the LPN
and at the Macro cell with a substantially different strength.\ This has an
impact on coverage, cell load and the overall interference environment.
Generally speaking, coverage is determined by a number of factors, including
the transmit power and the path loss (further coverage analysis can be found
in subclause 7.1.1).\ As the serving cell selection as well as the active set
management are mainly based on the downlink received signal strength, the
transmit power of each cell largely determines the coverage area of the cell.
Typically, high transmit power nodes cover larger areas than low transmit
power nodes. However, from the uplink perspective, the strength of the signal
being received at each node does not rely on the downlink transmit power of
each node. Consequently, introduction of LPNs in the network could potentially
cause a large DL-UL imbalance in the sense that, in the uplink, cells other
than the serving cell could receive a much stronger signal from the UE than
the serving cell.
Figure 5: Heterogeneous network deployment
Given a certain deployment of macro nodes and LPNs, depending on the UE
position relative to the Macro cell and the LPN, the interference scenario can
be very different. Figure 5 illustrates a heterogeneous network deployment and
the distance points between a macro node and a LPN where the interference
scenario is substantially different.\ The interference characteristics at
different distance points between macro and LPN are discussed.
**A** is the UL boundary. The UL boundary represents the point where UE path
loss to the Macro cell and to the LPN is the same. The received downlink power
difference depends on the transmit power difference between the macro node and
the LPN. If for example the transmit power of macro node and LPN is 43dBm and
37dBm, respectively, the received downlink power difference is 6 dB because
the path loss to the macro node and the LPN is the same.\ This means that at
this point the DL signal from the Macro cell is much stronger than the signal
from the LPN, while the UE signal received at the macro and LPN is the same.
**B** is the DL boundary. The DL boundary represents the point where the UE
measures the same CPICH receive power of the pilot signals transmitted by the
macro node and the LPN. The path loss difference is equal to the transmit
power difference because the received downlink power from the Macro cell and
the LPN is the same and the transmit powers are different. If the Cell
Individual Offset (CIO) of the serving cell change is configured at 0 dB,
event 1D for cell change is reported when the UE is positioned at the DL
boundary.\ This means that when the cell change occurs, the UE signal received
at the Macro cell is much weaker than the signal received at the LPN.
Thus, in heterogeneous networks the difference in transmit power between the
macro node and the LPN causes different coverage areas for the UL and the DL,
and this is generally referred to as _UL-DL imbalance_. The UL boundary (equal
path loss) and the DL boundary (equal downlink received power) are different
and the region between such boundaries is referred to as the _imbalance
region_ or _imbalance zone_.
### 6.1.1 Coverage issues
As a consequence of the downlink interference from the Macro cell to the
downlink of the LPN, the LPN coverage reduces when the LPN is deployed closer
to the Macro cell center. When deploying LPNs within the Macro cell coverage,
the LPN coverage is defined as the area where the received signal from the LPN
is stronger than the signal from the Macro cell,
_CPICH Ec/N0_ (LPN) > _CPICH Ec/N0_ (macro).
Since the DL received signal from the macro is stronger at the Macro cell
center with respect to the Macro cell edge, the LPN can have larger coverage
if deployed at the Macro cell edge, and the LPN coverage will shrink if
deployed closer to the Macro cell.
### 6.1.2 Uplink interference issues
With the DL-UL imbalance caused by the transmit power difference as well as
the loading imbalance between macro and LPNs, co-channel deployment could
potentially cause issues in the UL as described below.
1\. UL interference from macro UEs to LPN
This type of interference occurs when the macro UE is located in the imbalance
region, closer to the UL boundary and outside the SHO region (UE located
closer to point A in Figure 5). The excessive interference to the LPN is
caused by the UEs being served by the Macro cell, who do not have the victim
LPN in the active set. The UE is not in SHO however the UL to the LPN could be
stronger than the UL to the serving macro node (the path loss to the LPN is
smaller than that the path loss to the macro node). The LPN will not be able
to power control the UE or limit the UE grant by sending RGCH because the UE
is not in SHO. Consequently, the UE will transmit at high power and the LPN
could be a victim of large interference from the neighbour macro UEs. This
might impact the performance of receiver algorithms and reduce the RoT budget,
and therefore reduce the cell throughput in the LPN. This imbalance region is
referred to as the _strong mismatch zone_.
2\. UL interference from LPN UEs to macro node
This problem mainly arises from the uneven loading from the heterogeneous
network. When the LPN serves only a small number of UEs as compared to the
Macro cell, each UE served by the LPN receives generous grants and hence
transmits at a higher power. These high power LPN UEs are likely to be not in
SHO and can generate considerable uplink interference to the macro node while
the Macro cell cannot control this interference. When there are many LPNs
deployed within the Macro cell, the number of UEs served by the LPNs could be
very large, and this type of interference would be significant and will
degrade the UL throughput of the UEs served by the macro node.
3 UE in SHO
Whenever the UE is in SHO (both macro and LPN are included in the active set)
and power controlled towards the LPN, it might be problematic to reliably
receive essential control channel information in the serving cell (macro
NodeB) due to the weak link between the serving NodeB and the UE. For example,
the HS-DPCCH (which carries HARQ-ACK and CQI information to support DL data
transmission) and in-band/out-band SI need to be received in the serving cell
with sufficient good quality. Consequences such as poor HSPA cell throughput
in the serving cell, state-oscillations and dropped calls may otherwise be
present.
### 6.1.3 Downlink interference issues
Co-channel deployment for heterogeneous networks could potentially cause two
types of issues in the DL as described below.
1\. DL interference from macro node to LPN UEs
This type of interference occurs when the LPN UE is located near the DL
boundary (point B in Figure 5). The macro node downlink transmission generates
interference to the LPN UE downlink reception. The UE will change its serving
cell at point B if the CIO of event 1D is 0 dB. In this case, the macro
downlink interference to the LPN UE is not very strong and decreases as the UE
moves away from point B towards the LPN location because the received signal
from the macro node is weaker than the signal received from the LPN. Since it
is desired to offload more UEs to the LPN, the CIO for serving cell change
could be modified so that the serving cell change point is moved towards the
macro node location, as illustrated by the dashed arrow in Figure 5. The
technique of setting the CIO to a value larger than zero (as usually used in
homogeneous networks) is called _range expansion_. In this way, the coverage
of the LPN is enlarged so that UEs in the imbalance region can be served by
the LPN. However, the DL interference from the Macro cell to the LPN UEs will
be stronger.
2\. DL interference from LPN to macro node UEs
This type of interference occurs when the UE is in the SHO area and the Macro
cell is the serving cell. The LPN downlink signal generates interference to
the macro UEs.
### 6.1.4 Strong mismatch zone
The size of the strong mismatch zone could be significant, especially without
UL-DL mismatch compensation. Figure 6 shows these areas without LPN
desensitization and with LPN desensitization of 6dB for LPN 30dBm.
The legend for these figures is as follows:
  * CYAN depicts the strong mismatch zone (UE is seen by LPN but the LPN has not yet been added to the active set of the UE);
  * BROWNi is the area where the UE is in DL SHO area (LPN is stronger radio link);
  * YELLOW is the area where UE is in DL SHO area (macro is stronger radio link).
It is noted that the results shown below do not include multipath fading in
the propagation modeling. Therefore the results must be considered to be
optimistic compared to a practical network deployment.

The histograms in Figure 7 show the percentage of DL SHO area and the strong
mismatch zone area related to the total network area for different values of
desensitization.

height="1.9680555555555554in"}{width="3.270138888888889in"

Figure 7: Histogram of the DL SHO areas (DL) and strong mismatch zones (UL)
for LPN=30dBm (left) and LPN=37dBm (right) for different values of CIO and
padding/desensitization
The cumulative area of the strong mismatch zone compared to the cumulative
area of DL SHO is significant especially for an LPN with a power level of
30dBm. For an LPN of 30dBm and without any desensitization or CIO, strong
mismatch zone is about 14% of total network area and is larger than DL SHO
area which equals 9%.
When CIO is applied, the strong mismatch zone decreases because the DL SHO
area boundary shifts closer to the edge contour of the zone. The usage of 9dB
desensitization in LPN causes the contour of the zone to be included in the DL
SHO area where UE can add LPN to Active Set.
When CIO is not applied, complete balancing is achieved only when
desensitization level equals UL-DL mismatch which is 13dB for LPN with power
30dBm. However, a desensitization level of 13dB cannot be recommended due to
excessive amount of UL interference to the macro. When lower levels of
desensitization are applied, strong mismatch zone regions still exist. The
macro UEs located in this area generates the highest interferences to the LPN
in comparison to other areas in the network. With a LPN 37dBm the situation is
less problematic. With a desensitization level of 0dB (a recommended value),
the strong mismatch zone is approximately a few meters around the DL SHO area.
If LPNs with power levels of 24dBm were to also be considered, then the strong
mismatch zones would be quite large. The impact of noise desensitization on UL
throughput is described in subclause 7.1.5.
The strong mismatch zone is located outside of LPN DL boundaries. In order to
identify those UEs located in the strong mismatch zone, the following steps
could be performed:
Figure 8: Steps to identify UEs located in strong mismatch zones
In the first step a UE position is estimated by checking how it relates to a
particular LPN position. Some ways to do that are:
  * Monitor UE measurement reports messages for a particular LPN. It is possible to set a trigger using legacy measurement control which would allow the UE to report LPNs at low detection threshold. An early report would indicate that UE is getting close to a reported LPN.
  * Network driven localization methods could be used for that purpose to compare the measured UE location with an LPN position. The UE could be localized using GPS or Round-Trip-Time measurements.
Once identified, the RNC may provide to the LPNs the UEs UL transmission
details (Step 2) enabling the LPN to:
  1. Synch to UE transmission and,
  2. Measure the UE UL transmission,
  3. Report the measurement result to the RNC,
It is possible for an LPN to tune its UL receiver to a given UE UL scrambling
code with a given timing reference from the serving macro cell. Then the LPN
can measure the UE transmission (Step 3) and provide the measurement report to
the RNC (Step 4). In co-channel deployment the most useful measurement would
be the UL SINR. A comparison of the SINR reports from the Macro and LPN would
enable the RNC to detect the UE in the strong mismatch zone.
### 6.1.5 Uplink/Downlink imbalance issues
To address some of the UL-DL imbalance problems described above, available
network parameters such as the CIO and handover thresholds can be adjusted to
achieve _range expansion_ and _soft handover extension_. This will allow the
SHO region to cover parts of or in case of a limited imbalance level the
entire imbalance region. One positive effect from this is that the problem of
UEs creating excessive interference towards the LPNs is reduced.
Another aspect of a heterogeneous network deployment where LPNs have less
transmit power than macros is that the traffic uptake by the LPNs and
therefore the effect of macro traffic offloading may be very limited. From
network management perspectives, it is useful to be able to control the level
of Macro-cell offloading according to traffic load and distribution.
Techniques that can be used to expand the service area of a small cell, such
as range expansion, are desirable as they can be used to achieve load
balancing between Macro and small cells. Unfortunately range expansion
introduces new DL interference problems that need to be mitigated by other
techniques.
#### 6.1.5.1 Essential UL control information in the serving cell
Next we focus on reliable reception of UL control channel information in the
serving cell when a UE in SHO (both macro and LPN are included in the active
set) has a weak link towards the serving Macro cell due to UL/DL imbalance.
The following UL channels are considered:
  * **HS-DPCCH** \-- The HS-DPCCH carries UL control information, such as HARQ ACK and PCI/CQI, related to DL transmissions. Poor reception quality of the HS-DPCCH in the serving cell will cause degraded HSDPA cell and end-user throughput. Clause 6.1.4.2 further discusses this issue.
  * **E-DPCCH** \-- The E-DPCCH carries information about E-TFCI, re-submission number (RSN), and happy bit. The E-TFCI indicates which TBS the UE has employed and is used for demodulating and decoding data carried on E-DPDCH. The RSN is used for HARQ combining purposes. It should be noted that during SHO it is in general enough that one node (typically the LPN in this case) receives control information related to payload data demodulation reliably. Furthermore, the E-TFCI provides information about the gain factors used for E-DPDCH which can be useful for scheduling purposes. The happy bit is used by the UE to inform the network that it would benefit from a higher grant. Hence, the happy bit provides the network with important SI. Poor reception of the happy bit in the serving cell can cause worse end-user throughput and in worst case no UL granted rate at all.
  * **E-DPDCH** \-- The E-DPDCH carries payload data and also occasionally in-band SI, e.g. buffer and power statuses. Reliable reception of payload data in the serving cell is not crucial since it is enough that one node (in this case the LPN) receives it reliably. Also, it is worth noticing that for moderate to high data rates, the E-DPDCH is, in general, more costly in terms of power than other UL channels. Furthermore, it should be noted that if the UE has no grant it only reacts on DL HARQ feedback from the serving cell, i.e. HARQ feedback from non-serving cells is ignored. The reason is that it is the serving cell that needs to receive the grant request. Poor reception of the in-band SI in the serving cell can consequently cause degraded end-user throughput and in worst case no UL granted rate at all.
  * **DPCCH** \-- The DPCCH carries pilot bits and is used for channel estimation, path searching, synchronization, etc. Hence, a sufficiently good DPCCH reception quality is required to ensure reliable detection of any other UE channel.
From above it is clear that reliable reception of DPCCH, HS-DPCCH and E-DPCCH
are crucial for good system performance, whereas the E-DPDCH quality might be
less important, at least if in-band SI is not considered.
The power levels of UL channels are set relative to the DPCCH power via
channel dependent beta-values. The DPCCH power is adjusted by means of fast
power control to meet the SIR target, and the SIR target is controlled by the
OLPC to make sure that E-DPDCH satisfies a certain QoS target (number of
transmissions for successful decoding). Hence, the DPCCH SIR operating point
can be adjusted by choosing smaller or larger beta-ed values. Clearly,
depending on how one chooses to operate the system will affect the severity of
the imbalance problems discussed above. For example, operating at a low DPCCH
SIR means that the channel estimate becomes more sensitive to a reduction in
received signal quality. Furthermore, it should be noted that the impact of
the problems discussed above in practice will depend on several factors, such
as margins being used in the system and the size of the UL-DL imbalance
region.
It is obvious that heterogeneous network deployments need to work for legacy
users. This means that the problems described above need to be addressed
taking legacy into account. Nevertheless, this does not preclude that
performance enhancing features requiring standardization are considered for
Rel-12. One can envision that heterogeneous networks at a first stage are
deployed using simple and robust means to reduce the impact of the problems
discussed above, and at a later stage the performance is improved by
introducing Rel-12 standardized features.
#### 6.1.5.2 Impact on HS-DPCCH
Consider the soft handover region between the macro and the LPN. The Macro
cell (being the more dominant cell) is more likely to be the serving cell.
However, the uplink to the LPN is much better when the received pilot SNR on
the UL is considered. Since both the macro and the LPN power control the UE,
the transmit power of the UE would largely be driven by the LPN. As a
consequence, the HS-DPCCH channel which carries the HARQ-ACK and CQI
information may not be reliably decoded at the serving (Macro) cell. In this
scenario, unreliable HARQ-ACK decoding, especially high ACK to DTX error,
could cause unnecessary retransmissions and degrade the DL throughput
performance.
This impact on the HS-DPCCH is demonstrated by a simulation. In the simulation
conducted, the LPNs have a transmit power of 30dBm and have the same UL noise
figure (sensitivity) as the Macro cell. The cell that has the strongest
received CPICH RSCP at the UE receiver is assigned to be the serving cell.
Four LPNs are uniformly dropped per geographic area of each Macro sector. 16
UEs are uniformly dropped per geographic area of each Macro sector. For each
UE in SHO between Macro and LPN, the HS-DPCCH power off set (âˆ†~ACK~, âˆ†~NACK~)
to be 10dB.
Since the pilot consumes 10% of the total power at each node, the largest UL
imbalance is effectively the power difference between the LPN and the Macro
cell which is around 13dB in this example.
UL/DL imbalance is computed for each UE in the system as follows:
Figure 6 shows the imbalance distribution for the UEs in soft handover in the
entire system.
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | {width="3.270138888888889in" | | height="2.497916666666667in"} | height="2.4493055555555556in"} | | | | | Figure 9: UL Imbalance CDF for | Figure 10: HS-DPCCH ACK->DTX | | SHO UEs | Error Prob CDF | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
From Figure 9, it can be seen that 20% of the UEs that are in SHO observe UL
imbalance higher than 8dB.\ This corresponds to around 8% of the total UE
population. Those UEs would be received with quite low pilot SINR values (\~
-30dB) at the serving cell. Finger tracking loops in practical receivers would
be challenged at such low pilot power levels. This would in turn affect the
decoding performance of the HS-DPCCH channel.
Figure 10 shows the ACK -> NACK/DTX error probability CDF for the whole UE
population. This is caused by UL/DL imbalance which in turn is a consequence
of the different transmit power levels of the macro and the LPNs.\ High ACK ->
NACK/DTX probabilities lead to additional DL retransmissions which affect DL
throughputs.
#### 6.1.5.3 Impact on uplink SI
A similar issue as described in subclause 6.1.4.2 for HS-DPCCH exists for
transmission of SI for enhanced uplink. In problematic case, the UE has
smaller path loss to LPN but serving cell is the Macro cell due to node B
transmission power imbalance. The imbalance in pathloss can be relatively high
since it depends on node B transmission power and pilot Ec/Ior.
In case where SI problem occurs the Macro cell acts as a serving cell and
uplink is in macro diversity.\ The uplink power control is thus dominated by
the small cell reception performance. SI is transmitted on E-DPDCH and
received only by E-DPDCH serving cell instead of macro diversity which is
generally used for E-DPDCH data. This may cause a situation where uplink
transmission power can get too low for successful reception of SI in the
serving node B. SI is needed only by scheduler function of serving node B.\
There are two different cases for transmission of SI depending on whether it
is transmitted together with data or not (see 3GPP TS 25.321 [4]):
> 1\. When the SI is sent alone:
  * The power offset is configured by RRC and the maximum number of re-transmissions is defined in 3GPP TS 25.321
```{=html}
``` \- HARQ (re)transmissions are performed until an ACK from the RLS
containing the serving cell is received or until the maximum number of
transmissions is reached
> 2\. When the SI is sent with data
  * HARQ power offset for the highest priority data is used and the maximum number of transmissions among all the considered HARQ profiles associated to the MAC-d flows for the MAC-e / MAC-i PDU to be transmitted
  * HARQ (re)transmissions are performed until an ACK is received, or until the maximum number of transmissions is reached
    * if the UE receives an ACK from an RLS not containing the serving cell for a packet that includes SI, it flushes the packet and includes the SI with new data payload in the following packet
As can be seen there are fewer problems in case SI is transmitted alone since
UE keeps doing HARQ re-transmissions as long as it gets acknowledgement from
serving cell and also power offset is configurable, however case where SI is
transmitted together with data is more complicated. In such case data
reception is done in macro diversity mode and if cell other than serving cell
acknowledges data first then SI is retransmitted with new data payload as a
new data packet with less HARQ gain compared to the standalone SI case. Such a
mechanism could cause severe delay or even permanent failure in SI
transmission if reception performance of serving cell is much worse than some
other cell in macro diversity.
Obviously increasing E-DPDCH beta factor can be used as a solution in
transmission case 1 but in case 2 it would cause increased transmission power
also for data payload which has been determined by E-TFC selection procedure
with the constraint of maximum allowed E-DPDCH transmission power. Hence there
is a high possibility that maximum transmission power determined by serving
grant would be exceeded. Also E-DCH data other than SI is received in macro
diversity mode, which would further affect the outer loop power control
action. Hence a different solution is needed for case 2.
More insight into the problem can be gained by comparing uplink packet error
rates of macro diversity UEs in each cell before selection combining. Related
simulation results can be seen in figures 11 and 12, where \"primary PER\" and
\"secondary PER\" refer to UL packet error rates of the serving cell link and
the best non-serving cell link in the radio link sets respectively. The
serving cell chosen in the simulations is the best cell in the downlink
perspective i.e. transmission power of node B affects the selection as usual.
The \"Total PER\" refers to packet error rate obtained by applying the
selection diversity combining. The HetNet scenario results are further divided
into several groups e.g.:
  * \"Macro-LPN HO UEs\": Primary (best) cell for UE is Macro cell and secondary (second best) cell is LPN cell.
  * \"LPN-Macro HO UEs\": Primary (best) cell for UE is LPN cell and secondary (second best) cell is Macro cell.
  * \"Macro HO UEs\": All UEs where primary cell is Macro cell
  * \"LPN HO UEs\": All UEs where primary cell is LPN cell
  * \"HO UEs\": All handover UEs in HetNet scenario
In this clause it was assumed that UEs in soft handover between macro and LPN
cell could have a problem in SI reception and indeed \"Macro-LPN HO UEs\" has
much higher Packet Error Rate than the rest of the cases.\ The PER degrades
when transmission power difference between node Bs in hand over gets higher.
The problem can be somewhat mitigated by applying CIO but there is an upper
limit to CIO value that can be used.

## 6.2 Mobility aspects
### 6.2.1 Discovery and identification of small cells
The typical deployment scenarios for small cell are:
  * One macro frequency layer provides full coverage and small cells are deployed in the same frequency layer, i.e., coâ€‘channel deployment. This scenario applies to single or multi frequency deployments, where Macro and small cells can be deployed on one or multiple carriers.
  * Small cells are deployed on another frequency layer, i.e., dedicated channel or dedicated frequency deployment, for the purpose of traffic offloading. Thus it is required that the UE under the coverage of the small cell should be able to select/reselect/handover to the small cell frequency in order to offload the UE to the small cell.
  * Mixed co-channel and dedicated carrier deployments.
  * One or more low power nodes are deployed within the combined-cell coverage area, where a LPN is one of the spatially separated transmit-receive points in the combined cell and the transmission/reception points created by the LPNs have the same L3 cell identity (same primary scrambling code) as compared to the Macro cell.
Since small cells are typically scattered within macro layer providing non-
continuous coverage, it is the common understanding that continuously
performing inter-frequency measurements may be unnecessary, and will cause
significant UE battery consumption and potential data transmission
interruption (e.g. if compressed mode is needed). The unnecessary intra-
frequency measurements should also be minimized (especially in Idle mode),
although these issues are expected to be less significant (e.g. on UE battery
consumption) than the inter-frequency measurements.
This study focused on the discovery and identification of small cells on a
different frequency, aiming the purpose of reducing UE battery consumption and
data transmission interruption.
### 6.2.2 Mobility performance issues based on UE speed
For co-channel deployment, the coverage of small cell is much smaller than the
Macro cell, and typically the radio channel around the small cell will change
faster than the Macro cell channel. When UE moves between the Macro cell and
the small cell, more challenges on the performance of serving cell change and
active set update, especially when UE speed increases, could be expected, i.e.
more active set update failure and more serving cell change failures may
happen.
Another issue is more handover procedures and signalling messages due to the
deployment of small cells.\ After deploying the small cell, the UE has to
perform more handover procedures (between Macro and small cell, and vice
versa) compared with the legacy Macro cell deployment.
Some observations for simulation results have been described in the Annex A.8.
### 6.2.3 Mobility issues of massive deployment of small cells
Depending on the requirements of system throughput gain and the transmission
power of small cell, many small cells may be deployed within one Macro cell
coverage.
There might be an issue of PSC confusion or not, pending on different
mechanism of PSC allocation for small cells. There are two kinds of PSC
allocation method for the small cells:
1\. Non-sharing allocation: In this method, each small cell is assigned with a
unique PSC in one Macro cell coverage.
2\. Sharing allocation: In this method, one PSC can be assigned to several
small cells within one Macro cell coverage if those small cells are not
adjacent to each other, which enables the possibility that all of the
neighbouring Macro cells and small cells can be put into the NCL without
extending the NCL size.
PSC confusion might happen for the sharing allocation case, which technically
is similar as what had been discussed for the HNB in Rel-11. For Non-share
allocation, it should be noted that if the small cells deployed in a
coordinated way with careful network planning, it is reasonable to assume that
there should be no PSC confusion issue.
While for non-sharing allocation case, even if each small cell is assigned
with a unique PSC, if all the small cells could not be included in the
Neighbour Cell List (NCL), the detection of small cells may need to rely on
the intra/ inter-frequency detect set operation which may cause a significant
delay in the handover procedure. However, the current size of NCL is limited
to 32 cells per frequency which might be insufficient if small cells are to be
deployed.
### 6.2.4 Mobility issues of Multiflow and multi-carrier operation
Currently DF-DC is not a valid configuration in Multiflow operation, while it
might be useful in HetNet deployment scenario, thus there might be some
mobility related issues, including sub-optimal inter-frequency
measurements/events and the changing of serving frequency/cell (see [26]).
In case of power range expansion on one carrier, the coverage of Macro cell on
that frequency is shrunk, so if the UE moves from Macro cell to small cell on
that frequency in case of DC-HSDPA operation, there may be an issue of
inefficient secondary serving cell change (see [25]).
# 7 Solutions and techniques
## 7.1 Solutions for co-channel scenarios
### 7.1.1 Analysis of UL/DL mismatch
In co-channel scenarios for heterogeneous networks, there is a UL/DL mismatch
region between the Macro cell and LPN since the LPN has smaller power than the
Macro cell. Besides the DL and UL interference issues, illustrated in Figure
13, the UL/DL mismatch can also introduce problems for the serving cell in
order to receive essential control information.
{width="5.491666666666666in" height="1.7in"}
Figure 13: The issue of macro UE uplink reception quality in non SHO area
As illustrated in Figure 14, when the UE is in the SHO region, its uplink
transmit power is controlled by both the macro NodeB and LPN. Considering the
SHO area is usually on the right side of the UL boundary, the UE will have
larger received power on the LPN compared with that on the Macro cell.
Therefore the dominating power control loop would be on the LPN side, which
causes the SIR on the macro side be likely below the expected SIR target on
the macro.\ If the UE serving cell is still Macro cell, the reception of
essential control information will have bad performance on the macro side due
to the low signal quality. This will surely impact the HSDPA performance on
the downlink.\ This situation is depicted in Figure 11 where the issue with
HS-DPCCH reception is shown.
{width="5.491666666666666in" height="1.625in"}
Figure 14: Scenario with a UE in SHO area between a Macro cell and an LPN cell
In the next subclauses is provided a link budget analysis to derive the
condition for balancing or matching the UL and DL coverage defined as a
situation where the UL and DL coverage boundaries coincide. Following the
analysis, in subclause 7.1.2, a number of solutions are described that are
applicable to all UEs, including legacy UEs not implementing Rel-12
functionality.
#### 7.1.1.1 DL coverage boundary
Assuming that:
  * The RRM decisions are based on primary CPICH RSCP or E~c~/N~0~.
  * The $E_{c,\text{CPICH}}/I_{\text{or}}$ setting is the same at each > node.
  * The same UE receiver functionality is employed for reception from > each Node B.
The DL coverage boundary is defined as the locus where received CPICH RSCP
from both types of node, seen at the UE antenna port, is equal. This can be
written as:
$I_{\text{or},\text{MN}} + G_{\text{DL},\text{MN}} - L_{\text{DL},\text{MN}} +
G_{\text{DL},\text{UE}} = I_{\text{or},\text{LN}} + G_{\text{DL},\text{LN}} -
L_{\text{DL},\text{LN}} + G_{\text{DL},\text{UE}}$ (1)
where $I_{\text{or},i}$ is the maximum transmit power;
$G_{\text{DL},\text{MN}}$, $G_{\text{DL},\text{LN}}$ are the network node TX
antenna gains towards the UE, $G_{\text{DL},\text{UE}}$ is UE antenna gain
(same towards both nodes), and $L_{\text{DL},i}$ is the pathloss. The values
are taken in the logarithmic domain i.e. in dB and dBm.
NOTE: Reference is made to the physical DL coverage boundary, rather than the
boundary biased by offset terms such as the CIO.
#### 7.1.1.2 UL coverage boundary
Compared to the DL, the UL coverage boundary is affected by additional factors
specific to each network node, namely:
  * Receiver factors, including the number of RX antennas, receiver > sensitivity or equalizer implementation.
  * The cell load.
The UL coverage boundary is the locus that leads to the desired signal SNR,
taken at the channel decoder input, is the same. This can be written as:
$\begin{matrix} E_{c,\text{UE}} + G_{\text{UL},\text{UE}} -
L_{\text{UL},\text{MN}} + G_{\text{UL},\text{MN}} + G_{\text{Div},\text{MN}} -
N_{t} - N_{\text{RX},\text{MN}} - \text{RoT}_{\text{MN}} +
G_{\text{eq},\text{MN}} = \ E_{c,\text{UE}} + G_{\text{UL},\text{UE}} -
L_{\text{UL},\text{LN}} + G_{\text{UL},\text{LN}} + G_{\text{Div},\text{LN}} -
N_{t} - N_{\text{RX},\text{LN}} - \text{RoT}_{\text{LN}} +
G_{\text{eq},\text{LN}} \ \end{matrix}$ (2)
where $E_{c,\text{UE}}$ corresponds to UE TX power, $G_{\text{UL},\text{UE}}$
is UE antenna gain (same towards both nodes), $L_{\text{UL},i}$ is the
pathloss, $G_{\text{UL},\text{MN}}$, $G_{\text{UL},\text{LN}}$ are the network
node RX antenna gains towards the UE, $G_{\text{Div},\text{MN}}$,
$G_{\text{Div},\text{LN}}$ are gains relating to RX antenna diversity (if
present), $N_{t}$ is the thermal noise power (same assumed in either node),
$N_{\text{RX},i}$ is the receiver noise figure, $\text{RoT}_{i}$ is the rise-
over-thermal value dependent on UL cell load and scheduler implementation,
$G_{\text{eq}\text{.}i}$ captures the potentially different equalizer
implementation for each node.
#### 7.1.1.3 Matching the UL and DL coverage
Assuming that:
  * the UE antenna gain is identical in UL and DL;
  * the network node antenna gains are identical in UL and DL and > denoted $G_{\text{MN}}$ and $G_{\text{LN}}$;
  * the pathloss between the UE and network node is identical in UL and > DL and is denoted $L_{\text{MN}}$ and $L_{\text{LN}}$, > respectively;
equations (1) and (2) can be simplified and combined, leading to the following
condition for UL/DL coverage match i.e. the UL and DL coverage boundaries
coinciding:
$I_{\text{or},\text{MN}} - I_{\text{or},\text{LN}} = \left(
G_{\text{Div},\text{MN}} - G_{\text{Div},\text{LN}} \right) - \left(
N_{\text{RX},\text{MN}} - N_{\text{RX},\text{LN}} \right) - \left(
\text{RoT}_{\text{MN}} - \text{RoT}_{\text{LN}} \right) + \left(
G_{\text{eq},\text{MN}} - G_{\text{eq},\text{LN}} \right)$ (3)
Given the assumptions, the following observations can be made:
  * The condition is not dependent on UE-specific parameters.
  * The condition is not dependent on the pathloss elements or network > node antenna gain towards the mobile station.
  * The condition is dependent solely on network node characteristics: > transmit power, antenna subsystem, noise figure, cell load and > receiver implementation.
The UL/DL mismatch or imbalance $M_{\text{UD}}$ can be defined as the
difference between the left and right hand side of (3):
$M_{\text{UD}} = \left( I_{\text{or},\text{MN}} - I_{\text{or},\text{LN}}
\right) - \left( G_{\text{Div},\text{MN}} - G_{\text{Div},\text{LN}} \right) +
\left( N_{\text{RX},\text{MN}} - N_{\text{RX},\text{LN}} \right) + \left(
\text{RoT}_{\text{MN}} - \text{RoT}_{\text{LN}} \right) - \left(
G_{\text{eq},\text{MN}} - G_{\text{eq},\text{LN}} \right)$ (4)
A positive mismatch value results in the situation illustrated by Figure 15
where a UE served by the Macro cell causes excess interference of
$M_{\text{UD}}$ dB into a neighbouring LPN cell.
The Node B parameters such as $I_{\text{or}}$, $N_{\text{RX}}$ and
$\text{RoT}$ may be set to achieve the desired mismatch. It needs to be
studied what mismatch value leads to maximum system capacity.

### 7.1.2 Solutions for legacy terminals
Several solutions to handle the UL/DL imbalance that are applicable to all
users, including legacy users, can be envisioned, such as:
  * LPN Noise Padding/Desensitization
  * Macro Node B TX power reduction
  * RoT target adjustment
  * SIR target manipulation
  * Semi-static or dynamic parameter tuning -- adjust available > parameters, such as beta-values (delta values) if the serving cell > is the Macro cell, employ repetition, or adjust cell individual > offsets and SHO parameters.
All these methods provide solutions that aim at reducing or limiting the UL/DL
imbalance. However, at the same time some of these methods reduce some of the
benefits offered by a heterogeneous network deployment. For example,
desensitization and SIR target manipulation imply that the interference level
increases towards the macro nodes. Macro node TX power reduction may
negatively affect coverage and excessively increasing the RoT or SIR target
may affect UL stability.
HS-DPCCH power offset boosting
In Rel-11, additional power offset values were added to the HS-DPCCH channel.
The additional power offsets could be used in heterogeneous networks as well.
Based on the received SIR measurements from the macro and LPNs, the RNC
estimates the amount of mismatch between the two cells and boosts the HS-DPCCH
power offset accordingly to overcome the mismatch.
Power control enhancements
In this scheme, the power control procedure is modified by the RNC in order to
allow better reception at the Macro cell. The RNC estimates the power mismatch
based on the received SNRs at the macro and LPNs and disables the power
control from the LPN. This can be done in two ways:
  * Remove the LPN from the UE active set. This would essentially put in the UE in a single cell mode where the macro power controls the UE.
  * The TPC commands from the LPN are always +1. This would effectively switch the power control to the Macro cell exclusively. The benefit of this scheme would be to maintain the benefits of soft handover while improving performance of the HS-DPCCH.
SIR manipulation
In this scheme the DPCCH SIR target is increased to provide a better phase
reference to the HS-DPCCH at the Macro cell. The RNC estimates the mismatch
between the macro and the LPN and adjusts the DPCCH set point to ensure
adequate HS-DPCCH decoding performance at the Macro cell.
The E-DPDCH power offsets are also correspondingly lowered to ensure that
there is no excess Ec/No seen at the LPN cell. While the link to the LPN may
be operating at a link in-efficient point, the control channel performance is
preserved. The new T/Ps would have to be signalled to the UE for the
adjustment to take effect.
{width="5.489583333333333in" height="1.75in"}
Figure 16: SIR adjustment for the reception of essential control information
on the serving cell side
E-DCH decoupling
E-DCH decoupling is possible for legacy terminals. E-DCH decoupling is
described in subclause 7.1.3.6.
LPN noise padding/desensitization
This is a way of reducing/removing the imbalance that can be implemented on
the network side and can therefore be used to address all users. By applying
desensitization, the received SINR in the LPN becomes worse and the UE needs
to increase the transmit power to reach the SINR target. For a UE in SHO
between a Macro cell and an LPN cell, this implies that the reception quality
in the Macro improves in some cases. Desensitization is described in subclause
7.1. 5.
Range expansion
Range expansion, realized by CIO or Macro cell transmit power reduction, is
described subclause 7.2.
RoT target adjustment
The LPN RoT target could be increased to accommodate the increased dynamic
range of interference. However, increasing the RoT target may affect UL
stability.
Inner Loop Power Control (ILPC) restriction
The UE would follow power control commands only from the serving cell (hence
ignoring the LPN commands or LPN commands if always +1). Additionally, a
safety mechanism can be introduced to control the level of interference
towards the LPN. This can be done in several ways, e.g. beta-ed is scaled to
ensure that the average E-DPDCH power in the LPN is kept roughly constant.
This information can be conveyed via RRC signalling.
### 7.1.3 Rel-12 enhancements
Different solutions to handle the UL control channel reception problem that
require standardization support can be considered. The objective is to solve
the problem while retaining as much as possible of the benefits offered by
heterogeneous network deployments. Furthermore, these solutions should
preferably be applied independently to different users, meaning that a user in
a good position should not suffer much if a user in a bad position employs a
particular method. Examples of such solutions include:
  * **Active set manipulation** \- Power control towards the weakest link or ignoring power control commands from strong non-serving cells are examples of possible solutions. These solutions have a severe drawback, namely that the interference towards the LPN increases, and therefore causing worse LPN performance (e.g. reduced coverage and off-loading capacity).
  * **Dynamic parameter tuning** \-- In heterogeneous network deployments it might be beneficial to have more dynamic ways of handling parameter settings.
    * Moving the control of gain values (delta values) from the RNC to relevant nodes. This allows more dynamic signalling of parameter settings via e.g. HS-SCCH orders instead of relying on slow RLC signalling. Furthermore, it makes it possible for a node that experiences poor reception of a channel to quickly react and order the UE to increase corresponding gain value(s).
    * One issue is that for some physical channels all involved nodes (NodeBs and UEs) need to have a consistent view on what gain values are used. In this case it might be difficult to let the nodes operate independently of each other since that might lead to miss-matches between them. However, for other channels a unified view might be less important, making independent and dynamic gain value signalling an attractive approach. Whether a unified view on gain values is important depends on a number of factors, such as the receiver structure.
  * **Dynamic power boosting** \-- Dynamic power boosting of individual uplink channels is one interesting approach to ensure reliable reception of control information. This is closely related to the previous bullet and a central question is how dynamic the boosting needs to be. One alternative is to boost via HS-SCCH orders, and another is to introduce a separate power control loop for channels that need to be boosted.
  * **Power backoff** \-- Power imbalance causes performance issue in case where uplink SI is transmitted with data payload in E-DPDCH. In such case it would be better to avoid boosting E-DPDCH power due to relatively high data rate causing high cost in power. One way to avoid that would be using power backoff in E-TFC selection so that TB size used would be lower and hence obtained coding gain higher. Another benefit of this method is that it causes less RoT variation than boosting E-DPDCH power.
  * **Additional pilots** \-- It is important to receive pilots with sufficiently good quality. One way to ensure this would be to boost the DPCCH, but this might be tricky since powers of other channels are set relative the DPCCH. Another alternative could be to introduce new and boosted pilots for UEs experiencing problems with the DPCCH quality.
  * **DPCCH operating point manipulation** \-- The quality of the E-DPDCH is essentially determined by the total power on E-DPDCH. Consequently, if the DPCCH SIR is increased while the gain factors (beta-eds) are decreased correspondingly, the quality of E-DPDCH will be maintained. Hence, by reducing the beta-eds, the DPCCH SIR is forced to increase, and the quality of DPCCH (and all other channels except E-DPDCH) is increased. This is one way of increasing the power of all channels except the E-DPDCH. This is beneficial since the quality of control channels increases and it avoids boosting the E-DPDCH.
#### 7.1.3.2 Introduction of secondary pilot
A secondary pilot is introduced on the uplink to act as the phase reference
for the HS-DPCCH channel and is power controlled only by the weaker Macro
cell. The E-DPCCH and the data channels would still be based on primary pilot
and UL data decoding performance is not affected. Due to the change in the
physical layer, this scheme would be applicable only to Rel-12 UEs.

information issue on the serving cell side
#### 7.1.3.4 Dynamic power boosting
Dynamic power boosting of individual uplink channels is one interesting
approach to ensure reliable reception of control information. A central
question is how dynamic the boosting needs to be.\ One alternative is to boost
via HS-SCCH orders, and another is to introduce a separate power control loop
for channels that need to be boosted. Another alternative would be to allow
the UE to autonomously change its gain values.
In general it can be favourable to let the UE constrain/control its gain
values since the UE has most up-to-date information about the power situation
(i.e. when extreme or excessive power is used). For example, whenever the
total (or data) power becomes too high relative the average power, the UE
limits the serving grant. This means that the UE will not cause excessive
interference towards the LPN (or best node) in situations where it most likely
is anyway unfavourable for the system to transmit with such high power. The
network does not have this up-to-date information and cannot respond as
quickly as the UE. Merits, drawbacks and exact mechanisms might need further
discussion.
One scenario where dynamic power boosting, or rather UE initiated power
boosting, could be very beneficial is for an initial UE grant request using
the happy bit conveyed on the E-DPCCH. Poor reception of an initial grant
request in the serving cell causes degraded end-user throughput or in worst
case no UL granted rate at all.
#### 7.1.3.5 E-TFC selection backoff for uplink SI
Transmit power imbalance between macro node and LPN causes performance issue
in case where uplink SI is transmitted with data payload in E-DPDCH. In such
case it would be better to avoid boosting E-DPDCH power due to relatively high
data rate which would result in high overall transmit power. One way to avoid
that would be using power backoff in E-TFC selection so that the resulting TB
size would be lower and hence higher coding gain would be obtained. Another
benefit of this method is that it causes less RoT variation than boosting
E-DPDCH power. This procedure can be either UE or network controlled. The
relative grant signalling is one such network controlled mechanism that
already exists. A UE controlled procedure could be to reduce the serving grant
by a factor proportional to the difference in instantaneous and average DPCCH
power. To further improve performance the application of backoff can be
combined with serving cell only HARQ acknowledgement where subframe is assumed
to be correctly received after acknowledgement is received from the serving
cell.
Applying E-TFC selection backoff improves code rate of SI but at the same time
reduces payload data rate. If applied backoff is too small then packet error
rate of SI in the serving cell remains too high and scheduling algorithm can
not reliably track the buffer status of the UE. If too high backoff value is
applied then the achieved payload data rate can get lower than in the baseline
homogeneous network case. However in such case the SI PER is below the
baseline level. Actual value of backoff used in each case needs to be
optimized taking into account e.g. transmission power of LPN, used CIO value
and the HARQ acknowledgement mode used.
Despite the method used for maintaining backoff, applying it would change the
uplink BLER. Hence usage of backoff should be somehow taken into account in
the uplink power control operation. The easiest way to do that would be
ignoring subframes where SI is transmitted when uplink SIR target is updated
for outer loop power control.
Due to the change in E-TFC selection behaviour and the possible additional
signalling required this scheme is limited to Rel-12 UEs only.
#### 7.1.3.6 E-DCH decoupling
##### 7.1.3.6.1 Description of E-DCH decoupling operation
In order to minimize negative effect of DL/UL mismatch it is proposed that the
LPN should be giving the UL grants/UL Tx power allocation to the UE. Two
approaches are possible:
  * LPN is providing grants directly to the UE (Rel-12 enhancement)
  * Grants are provided to the UE through macro (applicable to legacy terminals)
Figure 18 shows the first approach, the RNC adds LPN to the UE AS. In the RL
reconfiguration and RL setup procedures, the decoupling configuration
parameters are provided if the E-DCH decoupling operation is allowed for the
UE. The same is transacted to the UE. Once the UE acknowledges the LPN
addition, the LPN starts providing the UL budget to the UE. The LPN directly
communicates this grant to the UE and the scheduling operation is initialized.
The Serving Grant update keeps happening as long as the LPN is in the AS of
the UE.

Figure 18: Approach 1 (E-DCH decoupling for new terminals)
Figure 19 shows the second approach, the RNC adds LPN to the UE AS. In the RL
reconfiguration and RL setup procedures, the decoupling configuration
parameters are provided if the E-DCH decoupling operation is allowed for the
UE. Once the UE acknowledges the LPN addition, the LPN starts providing the UL
budget to the UE. The message is shown to be routed via the RNC (although in
principle a direct message could also be sent between the Node-Bs). Beyond
this point, the macro communicates this grant to the UE and the scheduling
operation is initialized. The Serving Grant update keeps happening as long as
the LPN is in the AS of the UE.
{width="4.924305555555556in" height="4.225694444444445in"}
Figure 19: Approach 2 (E-DCH decoupling for legacy terminals)
Decoupling the UL transmission to the smaller cell enables the UL transmission
to be power adjusted in such a way that it is received by the LPN only. This,
in contrast to the other approach in which the macro sets the UL transmission
range, is not causing high interference at the LPN, while still ensuring that
the small cell is receiving the UL transmission with sufficient quality. Due
to this UL transmission decoupling it is possible to utilize also macro UL
resources in a more efficient way: The macro does not need to allocate an UL
budget to the UE so it can be available for other UEs in macro area.
For this operation to succeed it is assumed that the UE can receive DL
channels from the LPN that pertain to E-DCH reception, such as E-HICH, E-AGCH
and E-RGCH in case LPN directly controls the UL grant.
When the LPN is controlling directly or indirectly the UL grant, it must be
ensured however that the UL feedback channels for the macro DL are still being
received by the macro. That is, it must be ensured that the macro can receive
the HS-DPCCH. However in this case we have more power headroom for HS-DPCCH
boosting when E-DCH decoupling is used because E-DCH channels power is now
controlled by the LPN and due to much lower path loss towards LPN those power
levels are reduced. This situation is depicted on Figure 20 below. When the
LPN is providing grants directly to the UE the E-AGCH is transmitted not by
the macro, but by the LPN. The macro instead may transmit the E-RGCH.
When the LPN is providing grants indirectly to the UE through the macro, it
will inform the macro via the RNC about the grants that the macro can then
relay to the UE via the E-AGCH or E-RGCH. There is a delay associated with the
relaying of the grant. The delay can be assumed to be in the range of 50 to
200 msec. The longer the UE performs UL transmission the less relevant the
delay will be. This operation can be transparent to the UE.
Main advantage of this solution is that UE UL power is utilized in optimal
way.
The proposed decoupling method solves also an important problem with reliable
reception of UL control information (E-TFCI, RSN, happy bit, in-band SI) for
E-DCH transmission sent via E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH channels. In a legacy system
in HetNet environment and inside the SHO area (when UL serving cell is Macro
and power control is dominated by LPN), important UL control information may
not be reliably decoded at the serving Macro cell. With E-DCH decoupling
method, the LPN is the UL serving cell and dominates UL power control for SHO
UEs so the reliable detection of E-DCH control channels designated to serving
cell is guaranteed.
NOTE: The solution has some commonalities with the \"common E-RGCH\" described
in subclause 7.1.6.2.

##### 7.1.3.6.2 Evaluation of E-DCH decoupling
Throughput Performance
Figure 21 illustrates the DL/UL serving regions of Macro and LPN for HetNet
baseline, E-DCH decoupling and early Serving Cell Change (SCC). In the early
SCC scenario an LPN cell is always selected as the HS-DSCH and E-DCH serving
cell whenever the active set comprises Macro and LPN cells. Point A and point
B are the UL boundary and DL boundary, respectively. Point C and D are the SHO
boundaries of Macro and LPN. The active set includes both Macro and LPN for
the UE located in the SHO region.
Figure 21: DL/UL serving regions of Macro and LPN for various scenarios (CIO =
0dB)
HetNet baseline: Point B is the downlink serving cell change point for HetNet
baseline, also for the uplink. The UE receives data and UL grants both from
LPN when moving across the Point B from Macro to LPN.
E-DCH decoupling: Point B is the downlink serving cell change point for E-DCH
decoupling solution. That means the UE may change the serving cell at Point B.
CD is the SHO region. At point C the event 1A is triggered and LPN is the UL
serving cell of the UE when the UE moves towards the LPN. In the CB region,
the decoupling UE will receive data from Macro and UL grants from LPN. But for
the HetNet baseline the UEs in the CB region will only receive UL grants from
macro.
Early SCC - The UE reports event 1A at point C, and also changes the serving
cell. In the CB region, the UE will receive both data and UL grants from LPN.
For uplink, they have the same behavior for early SCC and E-DCH decoupling UE
and their uplink serving cell change point is at Point C. This means for early
SCC, the serving cell change is triggered by event 1A. Hence, the early SCC
could be seen as event 1A-triggered SCC.
From Figure 21 it can be seen that DL serving cell change point for HetNet
baseline and E-DCH decoupling is the same, and DL performance is the same.
Then only DL performance of E-DCH decoupling and early SCC is compared.
The difference on uplink of E-DCH decoupling and early SCC is the HS-DPCCH
reception problem. For early SCC, the UE performs serving cell change when
reporting event 1A. LPN is the serving cell of both DL and UL. Macro does not
need to receive HS-DPCCH and the HS-DPCCH reception issue for baseline HetNet
discussed in subclause 7.1.1 does not exist for early SCC, while for E-DCH
decoupling the same issue as in HetNet baseline exists.
The baseline and early SCC can be applied to legacy terminals.
Table 1 shows throughput results from [52] and [53] for R1a = 3dB for HetNet
baseline, early SCC and E-DCH decoupling. The term of D-UE (Decoupled UE)
refers to the UEs located in the SHO zone.

For HetNet baseline and E-DCH decoupling, 6dB CIO seems to be an optimal
configuration for both DL and UL. Although 9dB CIO provides best UL
performance, DL performance is poor, especially for the edge UE. In addition,
the analysis in [54] shows that the quality of F-DPCH transmitted from the
non-serving LPN is unreliable with a CIO larger than 6dB. For early SCC, 3dB
CIO is the preferred value. Although UL throughput is higher for CIO of 6 or
9dB, these values would lead to low LPN UE geometry, penalizing DL cell edge
throughput. The baseline or early SCC cannot achieve the best performance for
DL and UL simultaneously with a single CIO configuration. It is noted that the
impact of HS-DPCCH reliability for E-DCH decoupling is taken into account in
the simulation results in Table X. Specifically, the value of the power offset
for HS-DPCCH is 10dB for E-DCH decoupling, and 0dB for early SCC. The main
observations from Table 1 are as follows:
  * Baseline vs. early SCC: Early SCC with CIO=3dB provides a better UL/DL throughput trade-off compared to baseline with CIO=6dB.
  * Early SCC vs. E-DCH decoupling: DL throughput is the same for early SCC with CIO=3dB and E-DCH decoupling with CIO=6dB. UL throughput of E-DCH decoupling with CIO=6dB is approximately 10% higher than early SCC with CIO=3dB.
Table 2 shows throughput results from [55] for R1a = 4.5dB for all UEs, LPN
UEs, Macro UEs with LPN in the Active Set (with E-DCH decoupling those UEs
become LPN UEs, but the same classification is kept) and Macro UEs without LPN
in the Active Set.

When comparing the results of E-DCH decoupling on and off at a certain CIO, it
can be observed that the edge performance for all UEs is worse and in many
cases the average and median throughputs are better when E-DCH decoupling is
applied. From Table Y, it can also be seen that the baseline with 6dB CIO has
better uplink performance than the E-DCH decoupling on with 3dB.
When considering E-DCH decoupling for various CIO values, it can be observed
that the provided simulation results for the UE throughput for the LPN CIO of
3 dB demonstrate a limited impact of the E-DCH decoupling on the overall
system performance causing mainly a re-distribution of the budget between SHO,
LPN and Macro UEs. It is noted that the impact of HS-DPCCH reliability for
E-DCH decoupling is not taken into account in the simulation results in Table
Y. For higher LPN CIOs of 6-9 dB, additional gains in total UE average
throughput are seen, however a negative impact on the Macro is demonstrated,
especially at the average and cell edge performance. The main reason of the
throughput loss is the strong interference from SHO UEs served by LPNs to the
Macro nodes. Therefore, application of the E-DCH decoupling should be limited
to the cases of low CIO values. The E-DCH decoupling application threshold
depends on parameters such as LPN power, number of LPNs, number of UEs, etc.,
and should be independently selected in each case.
Scheduling Information reception reliability results
In case of HetNet and SHO region presented on Figure X an important factor to
consider is the UL power control, which will be dominated by the small cell
due to lower path loss towards the LPN. As a consequence the Scheduling
Information (SI) transmitted on E-DPDCH and E-DPCCH addressing the serving
cell may not be correctly received at the serving cell, i.e. UL transmission
power regulated by both cells may become too weak to correctly decode UL SI at
the serving node B. This issue was studied in details in [58].
The SI reception problem can be alleviated by decoupling the UL channels from
the macro cell to the LPN. Since E-DPDCH (Figure 23, 25 and 27 for different
CIO values) and E-DPCCH (Figure 22, 24 and 26 for different CIO values) will
now be correctly received by the LPN, which is in the role of serving cell,
the reliability of SI reception will be assured.
The problem with reception of UL HSUPA scheduling related information (happy-
bit, Scheduling Information) by the serving macro cell is solved. Poor
reception of the happy bit which is sent via E-DPCCH in the serving cell can
cause worse end-user throughput and in worst case no UL granted rate at all.
Poor reception of the in-band SI which is sent via E-DPDCH in the serving cell
can consequently cause degraded end-user throughput and in worst case no UL
granted rate at all. More details of the problems are described in [59].

The results for SI reception reliability demonstrate that for the E-DCH
decoupling disabled, the E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH BLERs at the serving Node B
(Macro) for SHO UEs reach 30% for E-DPCCH and 90% for E-DPDCH which is
significantly higher than the baseline levels of 10% and 20% correspondingly.
Application of the E-DCH decoupling decreases the error probabilities down to
the baseline levels for all CIO values because SI is transmitted to the LPN
having a stronger UL channel and performing the power control and UL data
reception functions.
##### 7.1.3.6.3 HSUPA DL control channels reliability with E-DCH decoupling
Power overhead calculations are presented in Tables 3, 4 and 5 for different
values of CIO, i.e. 3, 6 and 9 dB. The calculations have been done based on
requirements from link level simulation and power boosting calculated from DL
geometry values in [56].
The calculations have been done under the following assumptions:
  * 3 dB was added to the power overhead calculation for E-RGCH and E-HICH because those channels are used SF=128 and geometry SINR was calculated for SF=256.
  * The F-DPCH is fractional channel and it takes only 2 of 20 bits per slot per UE. The other 18 bits are not transmitted. In this case per one UE the total average power consumption is 10 times lower (10 dB lower).
  * The E-AGCH is a shared channel, and only one is transmitted by a node. One E-AGCH channel is used in calculation, if more channels are setup than the power overhead will increase accordingly.
  * The E-HICH, E-RGCH and F-DPCH are dedicated channels so the relative power specified for them are per UE.
  * For 3 dB CIO the average number of UEs per non-empty LPN is 1.6, for 6 dB CIO the average number of UEs is 1.7, and for 9 dB CIO the average number of UEs is 1.9 (with the assumption of 8 UEs in the network, 50% UEs in the hotspot, 4LPNs, 30dBm).

**The total power overhead for HSUPA DL channels in case of E-DCH decoupling
for TTI 2 ms is not very significant when CIO is 3 dB (about 7% of power
overhead) and 6 dB (about 15% of power overhead). The power overhead for those
channels is important for CIO 9 dB (about 30% of power overhead) and larger
CIO values. Hence, in order not to consume too much downlink overhead power,
E-DCH decoupling should operate at small to moderate CIO settings.**
**In case of TTI 10 ms the required power overhead is much lower as shown in
[57], so E-DCH decoupling could be used for much larger CIO values.**
**The largest power overhead is from E-AGCH channel which require significant
power after E-DCH decoupling especially for larger CIO values. The E-RGCH
channel is very robust so the required power overhead is not significant. The
power overhead in LPN for F-DPCH and E-HICH are the same for cases with or
without E-DCH decoupling because UE in SHO must receive those channels from
serving and non-serving cell.**
**The important note is that the calculated power overhead is required for SHO
UEs which were located in LPN cell edge (the worst case). The SHO UEs located
closer to LPN require less power overhead. Therefore when power control method
is used for HSUPA DL control channels the overall average power overhead could
be lower.**
##### 7.1.3.6.4 Conclusions for E-DCH decoupling
Based on the simulation results it can be concluded that E-DCH decoupling
improves SI performance and can then be regarded as one solution to resolve
the SI reliability reception issue which is present in HetNet deployments.
**UEs in the SHO region benefit from decoupling DL and UL. Studies indicate
that, the average UL system throughput is increased compared to baseline and
is comparable with early SCC. This method allows efficient control of the RoT
budget in high UL/DL imbalance scenarios which is one of the main bottlenecks
for HetNet deployments. It is noted that the throughput results in Tables 1
and 2 do not include the effect of SI reliability, which is assumed to be
ideal. With realistic estimation of the SI, the E-DCH decoupling gains over
baseline should be higher.**
E-DCH decoupling enables the compromise between DL and UL performance for a
single CIO value. The early SCC method was evaluated and it can be considered
as an alternative way of handling the DL/UL imbalance issue although a single
CIO value in this case cannot provide the best performance for DL and UL
simultaneously. Specifically, early SCC with CIO=3dB and E-DCH decoupling with
CIO=6dB were found to provide the same DL throughput, while the latter offered
a gain of approximately 10% in UL.
#### 7.1.3.7 Enhanced inner-loop power control restriction
One way of ensuring a reliable uplink towards the serving cell would be to
restrict the existing power control procedure by enforcing the UE to only
follow power control commands from the serving cell (the UE would ignore LPN
issued commands or one would ensure that LPN commands are always UP). For this
to work properly, additional constraints to ensure that the interference
towards the LPNs (and other cells) is controlled need to be added:
1) _UE constrained_ \- One alternative is to let the UE control that the
effective data transmit power does not become too high. For example, the UE
could compare its instantaneous transmit power with its average transmit power
and autonomously adjust the serving grant to keep a reasonable data power.
This alternative would require standard change.
2) _Network constrained_ \-- Another alternative is to let the network adapt
the serving grant via the E-RGCH, and possibly also adjust the UEs gain
reference values in order to control the LPN received power. This alternative
can be achieved without any standard impact as described in Section 7.1.2
(ILPC restriction). It is, however, an open question whether new standardized
signalling could improve the performance.
### 7.1.4 Evaluation of solutions for HS-DPCCH
#### 7.1.4.1 Evaluation 1
Solutions to ensure HS-DPCCH reliability are evaluated. The different
solutions considered are HS-DPCCH boosting, power control modification, SIR
manipulation and secondary pilot. Such solutions are described in subclauses
7.1.2 and 7.1.3.
False alarm and misdetection probabilities are the metrics used for evaluating
the performance of the HS-DPCCH channel, and are defined below.
**False alarm**
> This event occurs when the NodeB falsely detects an ACK on the HS-DPCCH
> channel. This can occur in two ways:
  * When the UE does not transmit (DTX) and the NodeB falsely receives > an ACK.
    * This event occurs when the HS-SCCH is not received on the > downlink at the UE. The UE therefore does not transmit an > acknowledgement on the HS-DPCCH channel. The NodeB then > falsely decodes the DTX as an ACK.
    * It is assumed that the HS-SCCH misdetection probability at the > UE is 1%
  * When the UE transmits a NACK which is falsely received as an ACK.
    * This error is unlikely to happen very often as the transition > probabilities > $P\left( N \rightarrow A \right)\text{ This assumes 10% BLER after the first transmission on the > downlink.
> Therefore, the false alarm probability can be expressed as:
>
> In the simulation we target the total false alarm probability to be 0.1%.
>
> Since $P\left( N \right) = 0\text{.}\text{099}$and$P\left( D \right) =
> 0\text{.}\text{01}$, the $P\left( N \rightarrow A|N \right) \cdot P\left( N
> \right)$ component is rather small and can potentially be considered to be
> negligible.
>
> Therefore, the effective false alarm target can be considered to be:
>
> NOTE: Such simplifying assumptions are not made in the following results. It
> is expected though that such an assumption would not change the nature of
> the results in a significant way.
**Misdetection or decoding error**
> This event occurs when the NodeB does not detect the ACK transmitted by the
> UE. This error event occurs in two ways:
  * When the UE transmits an ACK but the NodeB does not detect the > transmission and instead assumes DTX.\ > This event is the more common of the two.
  * When the UE transmits an ACK and the NodeB detects that there is a > transmission on the HS-DPCCH channel (not DTX) but erroneously > decodes it as a NACK.
> It is assumed that an ACK is transmitted 89.1% of the time which results
> from the assumption of 10% BLER after the first transmission.
>
> Therefore, the misdetection or decoding error probability can be expressed
> as:
>
> For purposes of comparison, the target probability for the misdetection or
> decoding error considered in the simulations is 1%. Note that since the CQI

The different solutions are compared by assessing the increase in the amount
of interference introduced at the LPN.\ The amount of interference is measured
by the increase in the Rx Ec/No.
The Rx Ec/No for the HS-DPCCH boosting, Power Control Modification, SIR
Manipulation solutions is computed as:
The Rx Ec/No for the Secondary Pilot solution is given by:
The baseline value is the Rx Ec/No at the LPN for 0dB mismatch. Results are
shown in Tables 6 and 7. The simulation assumptions are listed in Table 109 in
Annex A.5.

#### 7.1.4.2 Evaluation 2
Results for the methods described below can be found in Table 8. The
simulation assumptions are listed in Table 109 in Annex A.5. It is noted that
an overview of the methods is given in subclauses 7.1.2 and 7.1.3. Here
further details are specified in order to describe the simulation settings.
  * _Desensitization (LPN padding) --_ For the results in Table 8 the desensitization corresponding to the imbalance is applied in the LPN _._
  * _New pilot channel_ \-- A new pilot channel is introduced in the UL that is only power controlled by the serving cell. Power offsets of essential control channels (HS-DPCCH and possibly E-DPCCH) are set relative to this new channel. The SINR target for the new pilot channel equals the DPCCH SINR target, i.e. -21dB.
  * _SINR target manipulation_ \-- The SINR target is increased to ensure that the quality of essential received signals in the serving macro is sufficient, e.g. DPCCH, HS-DPCCH and E-DPCCH. At the same time the reference gain values are reduced correspondingly to ensure that the effective E-DPDCH quality (as seen by the LPN) remains the same. In the results presented below, the increase in SINR target and reduction of E-DPDCH gain factors corresponds to the imbalance plus a fixed offset by 2dB which gives a margin for Macro diversity effects.
  * _Inner loop power control (ILPC) restriction_ \-- In this scheme the UE follows power control commands only from the serving cell (hence ignoring the LPN or LPN is always sending +1). Furthermore, a safety mechanism is introduced to control the level of interference towards the LPN. This can be done in several ways, but in the results the Î²~ed~ is scaled to ensure that the average E-DPDCH power in the LPN is kept roughly constant. In practice the safety mechanism can be UE or network controlled.

The results indicate that the ILPC restriction with E-DPDCH power constraint,
the new pilot channel, and the SINR target manipulation schemes have very
similar performance in terms of required transmit power and HS-DPCCH reception
quality in the serving cell.
There are, however, some differences between the schemes that should be
considered:
  * The ILPC restriction and the SIR target manipulation schemes can be applied to legacy users and ensure reliable reception of all control channels (HS-DPCCH, E-DPCCH, and in-band E-DPDCH control information) in the serving cell. One question is how frequently the constraints (SIR target, reference values or serving grant) need to be updated for satisfactory operation. For legacy users, some of this information is conveyed via quite slow and expensive higher layer signalling, possibly making the schemes less robust.
    * Several Rel-12 enhancements can be envisioned, for example, the E-DPDCH power restriction can be handled autonomously by the UE, which makes it easier to respond faster to link imbalance changes, and thereby provides more robustness. One question is whether the UE should be allowed to change reference values, and not only the serving grant, autonomously as well.
  * The new pilot approach requires standardization changes and is therefore not applicable to legacy users. Also, the baseline solution addresses only the HS-DPCCH quality. The scheme can, however, be updated to take also E-DPCCH information into consideration. There will be an impact on both network nodes and UEs since the physical layer needs to be updated with the new pilot channel, and extra receiver processing is needed to estimate the additional channel and handle the HS-DPCCH power control. A benefit of this approach is that it is very dynamic, robust and can respond quickly to changes in the link quality.
### 7.1.5 Evaluation of noise padding/desensitization
For legacy terminals one method to reduce the UL-DL imbalance is noise
padding/desensitization at the LPN, which moves the UL balance point towards
the DL balance point. The use of noise padding forces LPN UEs to transmit at
higher power, potentially causing unnecessary interference to the neighbouring
cells. This could have significant impact to the overall performance in
heterogeneous networks, especially when most of the UEs are served by the
Macro.\ From an UL throughput point of view, LPN UL padding should be applied
at the minimum value, i.e. just enough to overcome the UL interference from
the neighbouring Macro UEs.
One of the main purposes for LPN UL padding is to overcome the excessive out-
of-cell UL interference that LPNs could observe. The levels of interference
each LPN observes is different and depend on the location of the LPN, the type
of UE, traffic distribution in the system, etc. To maximize the UL system
performance, adaptive algorithms to determine the best UL padding for each LPN
can be considered.
The UL capacity analysis presented in this clause does not take UL control
channel reliability into account (e.g. ideal E-DPCCH and HS-DPCCH decoding is
assumed). Modelling practical control channel reliability and overhead is
expected to affect UL throughput results: as the amount of LPN padding
reduces, the relative gains over the macro-only baseline reduce as well.
Quantifying the impact of UL control channel overhead is FFS.
**Uplink system simulation results**
The simulation assumptions are listed in Annex A.1. Some additional salient
assumptions are as follows: the LPN noise figure is assumed to be the same as
the noise figure of Macro nodes; 4 LPNs are uniformly dropped per geographic
area of each Macro sector; 8 UEs are dropped per geographic area of each Macro
sector with 50% Hotspot distribution; UL Full Buffer traffic is considered.
The Macro transmit power is 43dBm and the LPN transmit power is 30dBm,
therefore there is a maximum imbalance of 13 dB. To get insights about the
impact of Noise Padding on UL throughput, the configurations listed in Table 9
have been simulated. It is noted that the parameter values used in the
different configurations should be considered as examples to investigate the
UL performance trend.
Table 9: Configurations

Configuration **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8** CIO (dB) 0 0 0 3

* * *
Figure 28 shows the average, median and edge (5%) throughput gains in the
uplink for Macro + LPN UE. Gains are relative to the baseline case in which no
LPNs are deployed within the Macro cell area. It can be seen that a NP of 6dB
can improve UE average throughput, but median and edge throughputs are
reduced. A large NP of 13dB cannot further increase UE average throughput.
Instead, it reduces the median and edge throughputs significantly. Even
negative gain can be observed for edge UE throughput. Further analysis of this
fact will be given with separate Macro/LPN edge throughput performance results
as well as Macro/LPN RoT results.

Figure 28: Uplink performance with different configurations for Macro + LPN UE
Figure 29 shows separately the edge performance of Macro + LPN UE, Macro UE
and LPN UE. It can be seen that with NP, LPN UE performance improves
significantly, however Macro UE performance reduces significantly, especially
when NP is large. As there are more Macro UEs than LPN UEs, and LPN UE
performance becomes much higher than Macro UE performance when increasing the
amount of NP, the overall Macro + LPN edge UE performance is dominated by
Macro edge UE performance. This explains why Macro + LPN edge UE performance
is very close to the Macro edge UE performance, especially when LPN edge UE
performance is very high. Enlarging the CIO without NP, however, improves both
Macro edge UE and LPN edge UE performance.

Figure 29: Edge (5%) UE performance with different configurations
Table 10 shows the 90% Macro/LPN RoT of each configuration. It can be seen
that increasing NP increases the RoT of the Macro since the transmit power of
all LPN UEs increases and the interference level to the Macro node increases.
On the LPN side, for CIO=0dB, increasing NP reduces RoT at the LPN with more
than 1dB because when CIO=0dB, there is strong uncontrolled uplink
interference to the LPN. For CIO larger than 0 dB, increasing NP only reduces
RoT at the LPN within 1dB because the CIO already reduces the amount of Macro
UE interference to the LPN.

Adaptive noise padding at the LPN
The design goal of an adaptive algorithm to determine the best UL padding for
each LPN would be to apply minimum amount of padding necessary to control the
out-cell interference to the desirable level.
The following quantities are defined.
  * UL RoT (Nose Rise) is defined as$\text{RoT} = (\text{Ior} + \text{No}\frac{)}{\text{No}}$, where Ior is the total received signal power from all UEs in the system, No is the NodeB receiver thermal noise.
  * Ior can be divided into$\text{Ior} = \text{Ior}_{\text{serving}} + \text{Ior}_{\text{nsAS}} + \text{Ior}_{\text{outcell}}$, where $\text{Ior}_{\text{serving}}$is the total received signal power from all UEs served by the cell. $\text{Ior}_{\text{nsAS}}$ is the total received signal power from all UEs not served by the cell but having the cell in the active set. $\text{Ior}_{\text{outcell}}$ is total received signal power from all UEs not having the cell in the active set.
  * Out-cell RoT can be defined as$\text{RoT}_{\text{outcell}} = (\text{Ior}_{\text{outcell}} + \text{No}\frac{)}{\text{No}}$. Measurement of out-cell RoT can be obtained from the measurement of No and measurement of out-cell total received power$\text{Ior}_{\text{outcell}}$. To get estimate of $\text{Ior}_{\text{outcell}}$, NodeB can estimate the total received power Ior, and the total received power from the UEs that have the cell in the active set, i.e. $\text{Ior}_{\text{serving}} + \text{Ior}_{\text{nsAS}}$. Then, the remaining is the out-cell interference$\text{Ior}_{\text{outcell}}$.
The purpose of adaptive LPN UL padding is to control the
$\text{RoT}_{\text{outcell}}$ since this is the interference that LPN cannot
control via power control loop or relative grant channel (E-RGCH). When LPN
operates at the fixed RoT target and observes excessive out-cell interference,
to protect the UEs served by the LPN, LPN needs to increase its noise figure
via UL padding and ask UEs (served by the LPN) to transmit at higher power in
order to overcome the excessive out-cell interference.
One possible adaptive LPN UL padding procedure is as follows:
  * The LPN periodically measures the out-cell RoT,$\text{RoT}_{\text{outcell}}$.
  * If the $\text{RoT}_{\text{outcell}}$ is greater than the upper limit,$\text{RoT}_{\text{outcel}}^{\text{measure}} > \text{RoT}_{\text{outcel}}^{\text{up}}$, increase the LPN UL padding by $\Delta$.
  * If the $\text{RoT}_{\text{outcell}}$ is smaller than the lower limit,$\text{RoT}_{\text{outcel}}^{\text{measure}}  **RRS: QPSK+15codes** | | | > | | | > **Non-RRS: CQI based MCS | | | > without restricition** | | | | | | - **(Tables X3 and X4)** | | | | | | > **_RRS_ : restricted code | | | > numbers (5, 7 or 10 codes); | | | > modultion type is determined | | | > based on CQI value.** | | | > | | | > **_Non-RRS_ : CQI based MCS | | | > without restricition** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > TBS | > **Variable** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | CQI Feedback Cycle | **1 TTI** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > CQI Feedback Delay for RRS | > 4TTI, 6 TTI | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > CQI Feedback Delay for non-RRS | > 4 TTI | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > CQI feedback error | > 0 % | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK feedback | > 0 % | | > error | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > Maximum number of HS-DSCH | > 15 | | > codes | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > Number of HARQ Processes | > 6 | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > Maximum Number of H-ARQ | > **4** | | > Transmissions | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > Propagation Channel Type | > **PA3** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > Channel Estimation | > **Realistic** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > Noise Estimation | > **Realistic** | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > UE Receiver Type | > Pre-decoding IC receiver | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
Results for the following cases are shown in Table 33, 34 and 35.
  * **Pre-decoding IC (Baseline)** : The baseline is pre-decoding IC UE on non-RRS sub-frames, on which the transport formats (modulation type and code set) at the Macro NodeB are scheduled without restriction. In order to reflect the impact of the CQI mismatch in the simulation, a round-robin scheduler on Macro cell is assumed. The 6 Macro UEs in positions L7 to L12 are scheduled based on the CQI: the TF of each scheduled Macro UE is chosen based on the CQI. The typical value of 4 TTI delay is assumed as CQI delay.
  * **Pre-decoding IC with RRS**. An example of the modulation pattern based coordinated scheduling is shown in Table 33, in which the QPSK modulation and 15 HS-PDSCH codes are scheduled on the Macro link. Another example of code number pattern is shown in Table 34 and 35, in which 5, 7 and 10 codes restriction are simulated. The CQI delay of 4 TTIs is simulated and the results are given in Table 34. To reflect the impact of longer CQI delay caused by a longer RRS pattern, the results with a 6 TTI delay are given in Table 33 and 35.

Table 33 shows that for LPN IC UEs on location of L1, L2, L3 and L4, RRS can
bring about 15%\~25% gain compared with that for non-RRS subframe, even if a
larger CQI delay is assumed for the RRS case. For LPN IC UEs on L5, there is
no RRS gain because the strength of Macro interfering signal is weak and the
difference for the IC efficiency is small for different interfering Macro UEs.

Table 34 shows that for LPN IC UEs on location of L1, L2, L3 and L4, 7 codes
restriction on RRS can bring about 15\~20% gain compared with that for non-RRS
subframe. This means that if a 4 TTI pattern is applied, LPN Edge IC UE can
bring 15\~20% gain on RRS subframe. Similarly, the LPN edge UE can obtain 25%
gain on RRS type with 5 codes interfering HS-PDSCHs, and can still obtain 10%
gain on RRS type with 10 codes restriction.

Table 35 shows that for LPN IC UEs on location of L1, L2, L3 and L4, 7 codes
restriction on RRS can still bring almost larger than 10% gain compared with
that for non-RRS subframe even a larger CQI delay of 6 TTIs is assumed for the
situation of long pattern. This means if a 6 TTI Pattern is applied, LPN edge
IC UE can bring more than 10% gain on RRS subframe. Similarly, if a 6 TTI
pattern is configured, the LPN edge UE can obtain 20% gain on RRS type with 5
codes interfering HS-PDSCHs and still obtain 15% gain on RRS type with 10
codes restriction.
The impact on Macro UE of code restriction has not been evaluated.
## 7.2 Range expansion
In heterogeneous networks, most of the gains stems from the offloading of the
Macro users to the LPNs. On the other hand, in an interference limited system,
it is desirable for the UE to be served by the cell from which it receives the
strongest signals. Therefore, offloading from the Macro to the LPNs through
range expansion needs to be carefully considered.
In a heterogeneous network, Macro cells with larger transmit powers than the
LPNs cause more interference and have larger coverage areas. In some
deployment scenarios, the LPN could be over-shadowed by the Macro cell;
consequently, there would be limited offloading capability.
From the system performance perspective, it is desirable to evenly distribute
the UEs among all cells in the system.\ This can be achieved by extending the
range of the LPNs to cover a larger part of the cell and is referred to as
\"range expansion\".
### 7.2.1 Range expansion for co-channel deployments
The cell individual offset (CIO) is an existing mechanism that can be used to
increase UE offload from the Macro to the LPN layer in the co-channel HetNet
deployment.
As the LPN cell CIO is increased (while Macro cell CIO is 0 dB), it is
important to ensure the detectability of the LPN cell by the UEs located in
the CIO region between the LPN cells and Macro cells.
#### 7.2.1.1 Downlink control channel evaluation
##### 7.2.1.1.1 Evaluation methodology
A simplified HetNet model with one serving LPN and one dominant interfering
Macro is considered. The network comprises 19 Macro nodes, and each of them
has 3 sectors. The 19 times 3 Macro cells form a hexagonal grid. One of the
Macro cells becomes the dominant interferer of the LPN, whereas the rest of
the Macro cells are regarded as additional interference radiators, whose
transmission power ratio can be scaled according to the traffic loads. Figure
39 in subclause 7.1.8.3 illustrates the HetNet model used for the evaluation.
Table 36 shows the parameters used in the simulations.

Due to the lower transmit power of the LPN, the UL boundary is not aligned
with the DL boundary. The smaller coverage area of LPN usually leads to a
lower loading factor. Therefore, it is desirable to expand the DL coverage of
LPN, and this can be achieved by cell biasing. Basically, the DL boundary of
LPN can be pushed towards the direction of macro by the use of cell individual
offset (CIO). CIO can be defined as the dB difference in received signal power
from the macro and the LPN.
The serving LPN and the macro allocate the transmit power proportionally
according to the Ec/Ior assigned to a particular control channel. At UE side,
the power received from LPN and macros are calculated using the pathloss
formula in Table 36. For the topology in Figure 39, Table 37 shows Ior and Ioc
of LPN and its dominant macro interferer for given CIO values, where Ior
represents the received power and Ioc includes the thermal noise as well as
the interference from 56 outer macro cells as shown in Figure 32. As a result,
the received power at UE consists of three parts, that is: the desired signal
from LPN (Ior, LPN), the interference from dominant macro interference
(Ior,macro) and the interference from outer cells plus noise (Ioc). Then the
receiver of UE tries to decode the DL control channel of its serving LPN in
the presence of interferences Ior,macro and Ioc. Table 38 gives the Ior/Ioc
values of LPN and the dominant macro interferer for fully loaded and unloaded
situations.

##### 7.2.1.1.2 Evaluation of F-DPCH performance and impact on the uplink
[Evaluation from [39]]{.underline}
Simulation results for two sets of UE locations are shown.
Set 1. UE is located at the point where the difference in the geometry equals
the CIO value considered.
Set 2. UE can be located at any of the L1,...,L6 locations and the UE
association is determined based on the Ior difference between Macro and LPN,
and the CIO. All Macro cells are fully loaded. The interference environment
for UE placed at any of the L1,...,L6 locations is listed in Table 39, where
LPN_Ior is the received signal power from the LPN, Macro_Ior is the received
signal power from the major interfering Macro cell, and Ioc is the sum of
received signal from all other 56 Macro cells.

fully loaded)

When LPN_Ior - Macro_Ior >= CIO (RSCP based), then LPN is selected as the
serving cell of the UE. Otherwise, Macro is the serving cell. Table 40 lists
the UE locations that can be served by LPN with different CIOs.

As L4,...,L6 can already be served by LPN with CIO=0dB, the downlink control
channel performance is evaluated in locations L1, L2 and L3. The geometry for
an LPN UE is defined as
Geometry = (LPN_Ior / (Macro_Ior + Ioc)).
The UE geometry at L1,L2 and L3 locations when LPN is the serving cell is
given in Table 41.

The performance of F-DPCH with 1 Rx and 2 Rx UE, Rake receiver, is evaluated.
Realistic path search is used at the receiver. TPC BER is considered in the
F-DPCH performance evaluation without the consideration of the erasure
threshold. The TPC BER target is set to 4%. Tables 42 and 43 show the F-DPCH
evaluation results. Erasure behaviour is not modelled in the calculation of
BER.

3.8% 12 -10.1 14.1% -10.3 4% 15 -10 21.7% -10 8.7%
* * *
From the simulation results, it can be seen that for 1 Rx UE, the TPC BER
cannot converge to 4% with CIO larger 6dB, even with the maximum F-DPCH power.
For 2 Rx UE, the TPC BER can converge to 4% even with a 12dB CIO.
When the CIO is large, the required F-DPCH Ec/Ior to reach 4% BER is also
large. From the simulation results, one can see that relaxing the TPC BER
target to a higher value can reduce the required F-DPCH Ec/Ior. According to
25.331, the highest TPC BER target set by the network is 10%. It is then of
interest to look at the uplink performance when F-DPCH TPC BER is higher than
4%.
Impact of F-DPCH performance on the uplink
FRC3 traffic is assumed for the uplink simulations. UE changes the transmit
DPCCH power in accordance with the detected TPC bit, i.e. either down or up.
PA3 channel is simulated.
Table 44: FRC3

* * *
Figure 40 shows the throughput performance of FRC3 with 4%, 10%, 15% and 20%
TPC BER. It can be seen that when close to the peak throughput, the difference
in UE transmit power is very small even when TPC BER is 15%. When TPC BER is
20%, excessive transmit power is needed.

Figure 40: UL throughput with TPC BER of 4%, 10%, 15% and 20%
The results in Figure 40 show that with TPC BER of 10-15% the impact on UL
performance is small. This seems to suggest that a higher TPC BER target
(higher than 4%) for the LPN UE in range expansion region can be use. This
could effectively save the transmit power on F-DPCH.
From the evaluation of F-DPCH, it is observed that for single antenna UE,
F-DPCH has sufficient reception quality for CIO up to 6dB for single antenna
UE and CIO up to 9dB for dual antenna UE.
[Evaluation from [41]]{.underline}
In order to guarantee the reliability of control signalling in an
interference-limited environment without wasting the transmit power in DL, the
F-PDCH channel is operated under power control mode, and the TPC bits for
F-DPCH is sent on the UL DPCCH. In this study, we impose an upper bound on the
Ec/Ior of power controlled F-DPCH as shown in Table 36.
The F-DPCH is power controlled to meet the BER target of 4%. Ideal uplink for
DL TPC is assumed in this study. The dynamic range of F-DPCH Ec/Ior is set to
[-30 dB, -10 dB]. Tables 45-47 show the average Ec/Ior, BER and erasure rate
of F-DPCH channel.
It can be observed from Table 47 that when UE is equipped with single receive
antenna, the F-DPCH channel alone can consume a significant amount of transmit
power in order to meet the BER target of 4% and to accommodate CIO >0 dB in
fading channels. From Table 45, we can see that when CIO â‰¥ 9 dB, the 4% target
cannot be met for UE with single receive antenna, no matter the outer cell
interference is fully loaded or unloaded. Using dual receive antennas can
ameliorate the situation to some extent, but the BER target still cannot be
met when CIO â‰¥ 12 dB even though the Ec/Ior level of F-DPCH reaches the upper
bound of -10 dB.

The impact of the F-DPCH error and erasure on the uplink is shown in Table 48.
For each of the CIO values, the erasure and errors were modelled on the F-DPCH
channel on the downlink. When an erasure occurs, the UE does not apply the
decoded TPC command but instead maintains the transmit power level unchanged.
The Tx and Rx Ec/No losses corresponding to the error and erasures for the
different CIO values are shown.

As seen in Table 48, the uplink impact becomes pronounced when CIO values
exceed 9dB for both the single and dual Rx antenna cases.
##### 7.2.1.1.3 Evaluation of E-HICH performance
[Evaluation from [39]]{.underline}
In this evaluation the transmit power of E-HICH is fixed and the relative BLER
for different E-HICH Ec/Ior values is given. Single antenna UE and PA3 channel
are assumed in the link level simulations. Rake receiver with realistic path
searcher is used. The 3-slot E-HICH format is simulated.
E-HICH performance test depends on UE association. When LPN is the serving
cell, false alarm rate (FAR) is P(DTX or NACK -> ACK). Miss detection rate
(MDR) is P(ACK -> DTX or NACK). When LPN is the non-serving cell, FAR is
P(DTX->ACK), and MDR is P(ACK->DTX). In the evaluation, a detection threshold
is determined according to a FAR, with the transmitter sending an "all-DTX"
pattern. Then, MDR is evaluated using that threshold, with the transmitter
sending an "all-ACK" pattern. Table 49 shows the test cases according to the
UE association. It can be seen that when LPN is the serving cell, the FAR is
much higher when compared with the case when LPN is the non-serving cell. This
is because the serving cell MDR for a UE uplink transmission is very low
(MDR=0.1%).
Table 49: Test cases according to UE association
* * *
Scenario Parameter Value Case 1: UE is not in soft handover and LPN is the
serving cell Target Misdetection 5% Target False Alarm 10% Case 2: UE is in
soft handover and LPN is the serving cell Target Misdetection 5% Target False
Alarm 10% Case 3: UE is in soft handover and LPN is the non-serving cell
Target Misdetection 5% Target False Alarm 0.2%
* * *
The offset for event 1A/1B is 4.5dB. Test cases for the UE in different
locations with various CIOs are listed in Table 50, where an empty space means
that the UE is only served by the Macro, and the LPN does not transmit E-HICH.

Simulation results show that when the LPN is the serving cell, detection
performance is much better than when LPN is the non-serving cell. To evaluate
whether a UE can support a certain CIO, both cases when LPN is the serving
cell and when LPN is the non-serving cell need to be considered. For CIO=6dB,
the UE location at CIO=6dB for serving LPN, and the location at CIO=10.5dB
(considering that the offset for event 1A/1B is 4.5dB) for non-serving LPN.
For single antenna UE, the 5% MDR can be reached for CIO=0dB and 3dB. For
CIO=6dB, E-HICH MDR would be slightly higher than 5% when LPN is the non-
serving cell. CIO=6dB would be the largest value that can be used, otherwise
the MDR would be too high when LPN is the non-serving cell, even with -10dB
E-HICH Ec/Ior. For dual antenna UE, the reception quality substantially
improves, and a CIO of 9dB can be used. The required E-HICH power is also
reduced. In order to save E-HICH power and achieve better LPN E-HICH reception
quality for UE, 10ms E-DCH can be used for larger CIOs.
[Evaluation from [42]]{.underline}
Assuming the target for the false alarm rate (FAR) is 10% and the target for
the missed detection rate (MDR) is 5%, Tables 53-55 show the FAR, MDR along
with the average Ec/Ior for the non-SHO situation, wherein the E-DCH TTI is
2ms and the E-HICH power offset is chosen as -6 dB (relative to F-DPCH) to
satisfy the target FAR/MDR in large CIO scenarios. Tables 56-58 show the FAR,
MDR along with the average Ec/Ior for the SHO situation, wherein 10ms E-DCH
TTI is assumed and the E-HICH power offset is chosen as -8 dB (relative to
F-DPCH) to meet the target FAR/MDR in large CIO.
It can be seen from Tables 53-58 that the performance targets of FAR and MDR
can be satisfied by UE with dual receive antennas in both SHO and non-SHO
scenarios. Thanks to the use of power control, the required Ec/Ior is under
-16 dB for 2ms TTI and under -18 dB for 10ms TTI. For UE with single receive
antenna, the performance targets can be met for most of the CIOs at a higher
level of average Ec/Ior.

##### 7.2.1.1.4 Evaluation of HS-SCCH performance and impact on the downlink
[Evaluation from [39]]{.underline}
HS-SCCH type 1 is assumed. The HS-SCCH has a fixed power. Tables 59 and 60
show the BLER of HS-SCCH, the HS-PDSCH throughput when HS-SCCH is ideally
decoded, and the real throughput when the corresponding decoding error of HS-
SCCH is considered. The HS-PDSCH Ec/Ior is always -3.5dB.

* * *
From the simulation results, it can be seen that for single antenna UE, even
for CIO=0dB the HS-SCCH BLER with maximum HS-SCCH Ec/Ior of -8dB cannot
converge to 1%. However, the performance loss caused by HS-SCCH BLER is rather
small even for large BLERs. For dual antenna UE, HS-SCCH BLER can reach 1%
when UE is at CIO=0dB and 3dB. For CIO=9dB, the BLER is 4.3% with -8dB HS-SCCH
Ec/Ior, and the performance loss is only 1%.
As a result, an increased HS-SCCH BLER has only marginal impact on throughput
at low geometry. However the power consumption is not marginal even for a
single antenna UE at CIO=0dB. It can be observed then that for 1 Rx UE, about
1% throughput loss is caused by HS-SCCH BLER when UE is at CIO=6dB location.
For 2 Rx UE, about 1% throughput loss is caused by HS-SCCH BLER when UE is at
CIO=9dB location.
[Evaluation from [43]]{.underline}
In order to guarantee the reliability of control signalling in an
interference-limited environment without wasting the power in DL, power
control is activated for HS-SCCH in our simulations. The power control of HS-
SCCH can be implemented by the serving LPN based on the channel quality
information (CQI) obtained from HS-DPCCH. In this study, we impose an upper
bound on the Ec/Ior of power controlled HS control channels as shown in Table
36. Targeting 1% BLER with power control, the actual BLER and the
corresponding power requirements of HS-SCCH are given by Tables 61 and 62,
respectively. The dynamic range of Ec/Ior for HS-SCCH is set as [-18, -8] dB
and a realistic outer loop adjustment was used in HS-SCCH power control. It
can be observed from Tables 61-62 that using single receive antenna, the 1%
BLER target of HS-SCCH cannot be met when CIO â‰¥ 3dB for most of the cases
studied, even though the transmit Ec/Ior operates at the upper bound -8 dB.
Using dual receive antennas can effectively improve the BLER performance and
reduce the power consumption, which makes the 1% target to be met for CIO up
to 9 dB in most of the cases. If CIO were to be increased further to allow for
more advanced receivers such as network assisted interference canceller (NA-
IC), we would need to study further enhancement strategies for the HS-SCCH
performance. This is because HS-PDSCH can benefit from NA-IC but the strict
latency requirement on HS-SCCH decoding may prevent it from benefiting from
advanced interference cancellation techniques.
To illustrate the impacts of power-controlled HS-SCCH channel, we also show
the average throughput of HS-PDSCH with and without genie-aided ideal HS-SCCH
decoding in Tables 63 and 64, respectively, assuming the HARQ operates at 10%
BLER target after the first transmission. Moreover, the actual BLERs of HS-
PDSCH after 1^st^ transmission with and without ideal HS-SCCH decoding are
shown in Tables 65 and 66, respectively. It can be observed from Tables 63-66
that compared with ideal HS-SCCH decoding, there is additional throughput loss
due to higher BLER of realistic HS-SCCH decoding. Nevertheless, the
performance loss of HS-PDSCH due to realistic HS-SCCH decoding is not
significant. This is obvious for cases that CIO \ their geometries, while cell edge UEs may see some reduction. > Indoor UEs that are predominantly noise limited may experience > some reduction in the geometry on the range expansion carrier. > However, these UEs would typically change their serving cells to > the carrier for which the power is not reduced.

In general, it should be noted that the reduction of the transmit power of a
Macro cell that has an LPN should be performed carefully while taking into
account the long term loading conditions in the system. If a neighbouring
Macro cell that does not have any LPNs, is typically highly loaded, then
reduction of Macro transmit power may cause some load discrepancies in the
neighbour Macro. However, this is pertinent only to boundary Macro cells and
does not diminish the usefulness of the range expansion technique as a whole.
As seen in Figure 50, there are two different SHO regions for each frequency:
SHO1 on F1 and SHO2 on F2. DF-DC or DF-3C can be used for UEs in these regions
to further improve cell-edge performance. In addition, DF-DC can be used for
UEs located between the two SHO regions.

#### 7.2.2.3 Dual-Frequency Dual-Cell (DF-DC) operation
In the DF-DC Multiflow configuration, the UE receives data from two nodes
(Macro or LPNs) simultaneously on two difference frequencies. This is
illustrated in Figure 51.
{width="2.479861111111111in" height="0.8541666666666666in"}
Figure 51: Dual-Frequency Dual-Cell
Figure 51 shows that the UE receives data on frequencies F1 and F2 from
different cells. The cells could be Macro cells or LPNs. Both cells receive
HARQ-ACK and CQI information on the HS-DPCCH channel from the UE transmitted
on a single UL carrier that corresponds to the serving HS-DSCH cell.
If the serving cell corresponds to F1, then it is essential that the UE is in
soft handover between the two cells on that carrier. The uplink would
therefore be power controlled by both the nodes by transmitting F-DPCH on F1
as in legacy operation. Data transmission for the non-serving cell would occur
on F2, similar to Rel-8 DC operation.
It is important to note that when compared to Single-Frequency Dual-Cell (SF-
DC) operation, there is no requirement for UE interference rejection as DF-DC
operates on two different frequencies, therefore, DF-DC operations are
feasible for single receive antenna UEs as well.
#### 7.2.2.4 Performance of Single Frequency Dual Cell scenario
The benefit of the Multiflow (SF-DC) operation mostly comes from the load
balancing. In a medium to lightly loaded system, each cell does not always
have UEs to serve due to the bursty nature of the traffic. For the cell that
has available resources (code and power), Multiflow operation allows the cell
to serve nearby UEs that do not have this cell as the serving cell. The cell
that schedules the UE in addition to its own serving cell is called assisting
serving cell. It is important to note that, for each cell, compared to the UEs
who have the cell as the serving cell, the UEs that have the cell as the
assisting serving cell typically experience a lower geometry. Hence, Multiflow
operation cannot help a highly loaded system. On the contrary, when the system
load is not very high, Multiflow operation takes advantage of the statistical
multiplexing and offers enhanced user experience (user burst rate).
The evaluation shown here considers the bursty traffic model and the system
simulation assumptions as specified in Annex A.1. The user dropping criterion
is 50% clustering UE dropping, and for SF-DC downlink scheduling, in each
cell, UEs that have this cell as serving have the highest priority. Type 3i
receiver is assumed. The gains are presented as the percentage increase over
of the baseline throughput. The baseline is the result for the case where LPNs
are not present in the Macro cell and the Multiflow (SF-DC) operation is not
allowed. The simulation results are collected in [36].
From simulation results, with 8 UEs/Macro, the average TTI utilization is at
56% for baseline Macro only deployment without Multiflow, and when 4 LPNs per
Macro are deployed, the average TTI utilization is reduced to lower than 35%
at Macro cell. As a result, higher improvement from the Multiflow operation,
especially at the 5% burst rate, is observed for the 4 LPN case than for the
Macro only scenario. For the 5% burst rate in the scenario that 4 LPNs with
37dBm power are deployed with a 3dB CIO, it is observed a relative gain in the
range of 50% to 70% respect to the case that Multiflow operation is not used.
For the average burst rate, the gain is smaller. For the case of CIO of 6dB,
the 5% burst rate gain is larger. For the case of CIO of 0 dB, the Multiflow
gains are smaller.
For uniform UE dropping, the performance trend is similar to 50% clustering UE
dropping case, as the LPN deployment helps to lower the loading per Macro
cell, and consequently improves the system performance gain from the Multiflow
operation.
In conclusion, Multiflow operation improves the system performance at medium
to low loading, especially for the cell edge users. LPN deployment reduces the
loading per Macro cell as UEs are offloaded to LPNs from Macro cells. As the
load reduces, more gains can be observed from Multiflow operation. As the CIO
increases and the cell edge burst rate becomes smaller, Multiflow can improve
the performance of the cell edge users that are affected by the non-optimum
downlink cell selection. Hence Multiflow can be used as a complementary method
to improve the cell edge user performance when applying CIO.
#### 7.2.2.5 Performance of Macro power reduction as an LPN range expansion
technique
To evaluate the performance of Macro power reduction as an LPN range expansion
technique, the following two scenarios are considered:
  1. Interference limited system: The outdoor path loss model and > Inter-Site-Distance of 500m is considered (refer to the Annex for > additional simulation assumptions). Reducing the Macro transmit > power in the Macro only system does not result in geometry > degradation since the UE is interference limited.
  2. Thermal noise limited system: This scenario corresponds to the case > when the indoor path loss model is considered. In such systems, > indoor UEs may have large path loss values even to the strongest > cell. The geometries of these UEs are thermal noise limited.
Additionally, the following UEs are considered based on the serving cell
selection criterion:
  1. DC only: The UE is served by the same NodeB on both carriers. > Serving cell selection is based on the Max-Rate criterion. For > each sector, among the Ec/Io's on both carriers, the best Ec/Io is > used to denote the quality of that sector. The UE selects the > sector that has the best quality as the serving sector. 3dB CIO is > applied to bias serving cell selection toward the LPN.
  2. DF-DC capable: The UE could be served by different sectors on each > carrier. The serving cell selection is performed independently on > each carrier, i.e., for each carrier the UE selects the cell that > has the best Ec/Io as the serving cell. 3dB CIO is applied to bias > serving cell selection toward the LPN.
##### 7.2.2.5.1 Interference limited system with full buffer traffic
Four types of system performance metrics are considered:
  * Average UE throughput: it is calculated as the average throughput of all UEs in the system
  * 50% UE throughput: it is calculated as the median throughput of all UEs in the systems
  * 5% UE throughput: it is calculated as the throughput of the UEs at the 5% tail across all UEs in the system
  * Offloading Percentage: The LPN offloading percentage is calculated as follows:
where,
_L~F1~_ is the number of radio links associated with LPNs in frequency F1
_L~F2~_ is the number of radio links associated with LPNs in frequency F2
_M~F1~_ is the number of radio links associated with macro cells in frequency
F1
_M~F2~_ is the number of radio links associated with macro cells in frequency
F2
For purposes of this evaluation, in the figures shown below, the definitions
of range expansion on and off are as follows unless otherwise stated:
  * Range Expansion Off refers to the case where the Macro power on the secondary carrier is not altered. However, a CIO of 3dB is applied to bias the serving cell selection towards the LPN.
  * Range Expansion On refers to the case where the Macro power on the secondary carrier is not reduced. A CIO of 3dB is applied to bias the serving cell selection towards the LPN.
The gains are given in percentage throughput increase over the baseline. The
baseline is the result for the case where LPNs are not present.

Figure 53: DL full buffer performance with 30dBm LPNs and 50% clustering
dropping
Figures 52 and 53 show the UE throughput improvement from the Dual Carrier
HetNet deployment with 30dBm LPNs and 50% clustering UE dropping, with no-
indoor UEs.
Range expansion allows more UEs to be offloaded to LPNs, hence improves the
HetNet deployment gain. From Figure 52, with DC only operation, at 4
LPNs/Macro, comparing range expansion off with on, an increase in offloading
is seen from 33% to 67%.
From figures 52 and 53, the average UE throughput gain improves from around
191% to 340% and the 5% UE throughput gain improves from around 94% to 128%.
Note that the numbers quoted have been averaged across Figures 52 and 53.
DF-DC operation improves the range expansion gain. The benefit from DF-DC
operation is more evident at the 5% UE throughput, which implies that DF-DC
operation improves the fairness in the system. Using 4 LPNs/Macro as an
example, compared to DC only operation with range expansion, DF-DC operation
increase the 5% UE throughput gain from around 128% to 180%, while keeping the
mean and media UE throughput almost the same.

Figure 54: DL full buffer performance with 30dBm LPNs and uniform UE dropping,
no-indoor UEs
Figure 54 shows the UE throughput improvement from the Dual Carrier HetNet
deployment with 30dBm LPNs and uniform UE drops throughout the system.
When compared to 50% clustering UE dropping, uniform dropping results in fewer
UEs being offloaded to LPNs and, hence, less performance improvement from
HetNet deployments. The same trends are observed for DC only operation
compared to HetNet deployment without range expansion i.e. HetNet deployment
with range expansion provides further improvement, especially the mean and
media performance points. Furthermore, when we enable DF-DC operation under
range expansion, improvement to the system fairness is seen. Specifically,
increased 5% UE throughput gains can be observed.
##### 7.2.2.5.2 Thermal noise limited system with full buffer traffic
The impact on coverage-limited indoor UEs needs to be considered when reducing
Macro power. Even though, LPNs are typically deployed in dense urban areas
with small ISD, there still could be coverage limitations for indoor UEs. To
model indoor UEs, additional Building Penetration Loss (BPL) is added. The
salient simulation assumptions for indoor UEs are listed in Table 80.
Table 80: Salient system simulation assumptions for indoor UEs
* * *
**Parameter** **Value**
Building Penetration Loss (BPL)\ 11 dB Mean
Building Penetration Loss (BPL)\ 6.5 dB Standard Deviation
Indoor UE Modelling Each UE is assigned as indoors with a probability of x% (x
= 0, 60).\ For indoor UEs, BPL is randomly generated and added to the path
loss.
UL Link Budget 140 dB
* * *
Figure 55 illustrates the geometry impact on indoor UEs given power reduction
for the baseline Macro-only system. In cases with no indoor UEs, reducing the
Macro transmit power from 43dBm to 30dBm has very minimum impact on the UE
geometry since the system is interference limited. As indoor UEs with
additional BPL are added, the system becomes more noise limited and there is
more of an impact on the geometry distribution especially at the tail.

dropping, 60% indoor UEs
Figure 56 shows the UE throughput improvement from the Dual Carrier HetNet
deployment with 30dBm LPNs and 50% clustering UE dropping and 60% indoor UEs.
Compared to the case when indoor UEs are not modelled, the gain from range
expansion with DC or DF-DC operation is slightly decreased.
When considering DC only operation, comparing range expansion off with on, an
improvement in system performance is provided by range expansion. For example,
at 4 LPNs/Macro, range expansion increases the offloading from 36% to 66%.
Further the average UE throughput gain improves from 226% to 301% and the 5%
UE throughput gain improves from 67% to 99%. Enabling DF-DC operation with
range expansion significantly improves the system fairness, or the 5% UE
throughput. Using 4 LPNs/Macro as an example, compared to DC only operation
with range expansion, DF-DC operation increase the 5% UE throughput gain from
99% to 141%.

results also confirm the gain from range expansion with DC only and DF-DC
operation.
##### 7.2.2.5.3 Interference limited system with bursty traffic
The following system performance metrics are considered:
  * Average UE burst rate: Calculated as the average burst rate of all UEs in the system
  * 5% UE burst rate: Calculated as the burst rate of the UEs at 5% tail across all UEs in the system.
  * Offloading Percentage: The LPN offloading percentage is calculated as follows:
where,
_L~F1~_ is the number of radio links associated with LPNs in frequency F1
_L~F2~_ is the number of radio links associated with LPNs in frequency F2
_M~F1~_ is the number of radio links associated with macro cells in frequency
F1
_M~F2~_ is the number of radio links associated with macro cells in frequency
F2
  * Average TTI utilization: For each cell, the TTI utilization is defined as the percentage of TTIs during which each cell schedules a packet to at least one UE. Then, for each Macro/LPN, TTI utilization is averaged over both carriers. TTI utilization is only considered for non-empty cells and is a direct metric to quantify the load in the whole system.
The gains are presented as the percentage increase over the baseline
throughput. The baseline is the result for the case where LPNs are not present
in the Macro cell.
Figure 58 shows the UE burst rate improvement from the Dual Carrier HetNet
deployment with 30dBm LPNs and 50% clustering UE dropping, with no-indoor UE.
It is important to note that range expansion for HetNet dual-carrier
deployment benefits the system performance by allowing more UEs to be
offloaded from the Macro to LPNs. However, if the system has a low load to
begin with, i.e. low UE density or low TTI utilization in the baseline Macro
only system, the gains from range expansion are limited.
Additionally, if the range expansion is performed with DC only operation, it
may lead to a small performance loss at very low load situations, especially
at the 5% tail. When UEs are limited to be in DC only operations, the UEs in
the range expansion region have to be served by the same sector on both
carriers with a weaker cell on one carrier. This may negatively impact the UE
peak rate. For a lightly loaded system with bursty traffic, the UE burst rate
is mostly determined by the peak rate, hence, any scheme that limits the UE
peak rate may result in a performance loss. On the other hand, allowing DF-DC
operation with range expansion removes this limitation, therefore, does not
face the same limitations.

Table 81 shows additional simulation results using range expansion with
different CIO values. It is observed that the burst rate performance,
especially for the cell edge, of DC is sensitive to the CIO values used whilst
DFDC is insensitive to changes in CIO values at low to mid loading. Using a
suitable CIO value (e.g. 0 dB), a gain in burst rate performance of DC can be
achieved at low load with range expansion instead of a loss (e.g. when using
CIO = 3 dB). At high load, it is observed that using SC UEs can achieve
greater cell edge burst rate gain than that of DC UEs if the appropriate CIO
values are selected. In this scenario the SC CIO is set such that it is 1 dB
towards secondary carrier (F2) of macro cell, 2 dB towards primary carrier
(F1) of LPN and 3 dB towards secondary carrier (F2) of LPN.

Figure 58 and Table 81 show that the gains increase with the increase in load
and LPN density. DF-DC operation under range expansion offers higher and more
robust gains over DC only operation. For example, for the case of 4 LPNs/Macro
and16 UEs/Macro, without range expansion, the system offers an average burst
rate gain of 41% and a 5% burst rate gain of 71% over the no LPN baseline.
Range expansion with DC-only operation increases the average burst rate gain
to 55%, and increases 5% burst rate gain to 84%.
Range expansion with DF-DC operation increases both the average burst rate
gain and the 5% burst rate gain to 62% and 133%, respectively. When the load
is increased to 98% (32 UEs/Macro), deploying 4 LPNs without range expansion
offers an average burst rate gain of 161% and a 5% burst rate gain of 539%
over the baseline. Range expansion with DC-only operation increases the
average burst rate gain to 246% and increases the 5% burst rate gain to 849%.
Range expansion with DF-DC operation increases both the average burst rate
gain and the 5% burst rate gain to 237% and 1112%, respectively.

Figure 59: DL bursty traffic performance, 30dBm LPNs and uniform UE dropping,
no-indoor UEs
Figure 59 and Table 83 show the UE burst rate improvement and average TTI
utilization, respectively, from the HetNet deployment with 30dBm LPNs and
Uniform UE dropping and no-indoor UEs. Similar observations can be obtained as
those from the 50% clustering UE dropping. In general, range expansion with
DF-DC operation provides more robust and higher gains compared to range
expansion with DC only operation. The HetNet gain, as well as the range
expansion improvement, increases as the loading in the system increases. For
range expansion with DC only operation may cause some performance loss at low
to medium loading (due to UE peak rate impact). However, this could be
overcome by allowing DF-DC operation.
Range expansion with DC only operation performs worse than the HetNet
deployment without range expansion at 5% burst rate, under 16 UE/Macro which
corresponds to a baseline loading of 57%. On the other side, when DF-DC
operation is allowed for range expansion, UEs can be served by different
sectors on each carrier. As a result, the negative impact on the UE peak rate
is greatly mitigated.

##### 7.2.2.5.4 Thermal noise limited system with bursty traffic
Similar to the full buffer traffic scenario, the performance in a thermal
limited system with indoor UEs is considered. Indoor UEs are modelled with an
additional building penetration loss as before. The details of the simulation
and the distribution of the geometries can be found in subclause 7.2.2.5.2.

In general, we have the same observations as in the case of the interference
limited system. Consistent and significant performance benefit can be achieved
from HetNet deployment under range expansion with DF-DC operation, in terms of
both the average user experience (average UE burst rate) and worst case user
experience (5% UE burst rate).
Figure 61 and Table 85 show the UE burst rate improvement and average TTI
utilization, respectively, from the HetNet deployment with 30dBm LPNs and 50%
clustering UE dropping, 60% indoor UEs. In general, the gain is smaller
compared to clustering UE dropping.

##### 7.2.2.5.5 Performance in a mixed deployment scenario
A mixed HetNet deployment, in which only a subset of Macro cells have LPNs
being deployed is considered.
Figure 62: Mixed HetNet deployment, only green NodeBs (21 sectors) have LPNs
deployed, while light blue NodeBs (36 sectors) do not have LPNs
Figure 62 illustrates an example of a mixed HetNet deployment. The 57 cells
layout consists of three tiers of Macro NodeBs. Each Macro NodeB is sectorized
into three sectors. The first tier has 1 Macro NodeB (3 sector), the second
tier has 6 Macro NodeBs (18 sectors) and the third tier has 12 Macro NodeBs
(36 sectors). We only deploy LPNs in the geographic area of the centre 7 green
Macro NodeBs (21 sectors). The outer 12 light blue Macro NodeBs (36 sectors)
do not have any LPNs deployed. When range expansion is applied on carrier F2,
only the centre 21 green Macro sectors reduce their transmit power, the outer
36 light blue Macro sectors keep the same transmit power.
The general system simulation assumptions are summarized in the Annex. Some
salient aspects are:
  * 4 LPNs are uniformly dropped in the geographic area of each green Macro sector.
  * 16 UEs are dropped in the geographic area of each Macro sector. For the 21 green Macro sectors with LPNs, 50% Hotspot drops are used. For the 36 light blue Macro sectors without LPN, uniform dropping is applied.
  * Outdoor path loss model is considered.
  * LPNs transmit power is 30dBm per carrier. Without power reduction, Macro transmit power is 43dBm, with power reduction, green Macro sectors reduce their transmit power on F2 to 30dBm.
The same amounts of UEs are dropped per Macro sector irrespective of whether
the Macro sector has an LPN or not. As a result, the Macro sector without an
LPN is loaded more heavily as compared to the Macro sector with LPNs. Once the
transmit power on F2 from the Macro sectors with LPN is reduced, some of the
UEs could be switched to the Macro sectors without LPNs, which could further
increase the load discrepancy. In a practical deployment, LPNs are more likely
to be deployed in the Macro sectors that experience heavier traffic load
compared to the neighbouring Macro sectors. From this perspective, the
simulation results shown represent the worst case scenario.
Figure 63 shows the UE throughput improvement across the entire UE population
with and without range expansion. Without range expansion, performance gain
from the mixed HetNet deployment is much lower than the universal LPN
deployment as shown in previous subclauses. This is expected since in a mixed
HetNet deployment scenario, only 37% (21 out of 57) Macro sectors have LPNs
deployed. It is also interesting to see that the median and tail UE
performance improvement is small. This is because the majority of the UEs are
served by Macro cells without LPNs, therefore do not benefit from the HetNet
deployment under full buffer traffic.
Comparing range expansion on with range expansion off, we still observe
improvement in every system performance metric. The improvement is not as
significant as in the case of universal LPN deployment. The main benefit from
the range expansion technique is to equalize the load between the Macro sector
and LPNs, allowing more UEs to be served by LPNs. As LPNs are only deployed in
a subset of Macro sectors, the benefit from range expansion still exists, but
is somewhat reduced. With range expansion, DF-DC operation helps to improve
the system fairness. When compared to DC only operation, the DF-DC operation
improves the 5% UE tail throughput.

height="1.8534722222222222in"}
Figure 63: DL full buffer performance with 30dBm LPNs and mixed HetNet
deployment, entire UE population
Under the mixed HetNet deployment scenario, once the Macro sectors with LPNs
reduce their transmit power some UEs could be offloaded to the neighbouring
Macro sectors without LPNs. This could potentially cause some performance
degradation since the same amount of UEs per Macro sector are present
regardless of whether LPNs are deployed or not. In this setup, the Macro
sectors without LPNs serve more UEs than the Macro sectors with LPNs.
However, by reducing the Macro transmit power on F2; the interference to the
neighbouring Macro cells on F2 is also reduced. As a result, the UEs that are
served by the neighbouring Macro cells experience a geometry improvement on
F2. Consider the UEs that are served by the outer 36 Macro cells that have no
LPNs when range expansion is off. Their geometries on frequency F2 is shown in
Figure 64. Around 0.5- 1dB geometry improvement can be observed for the most
part.

Figure 64: CDF of geometry on F2 for UEs served by Macro cells without LPNs
Next, consider the UEs that are located in the second tier Macro NodeB (NodeB
1-6). As a whole population, after the range expansion, some UEs may
experience better performance since they are offloaded to LPNs, some may
experience worse performance since they are offloaded to the neighbouring
Macro cells without LPN. The rest of them stay with Macro cell and may observe
some geometry losses but also benefit from the reduction in Macro load as more
UEs are offloaded to the LPNs.
Figure 65 shows the throughput CDF among UEs that are dropped in the second
tier NodeB (NodeB 1-6). The gains are given in percentage throughput increase
over the baseline no LPN case. With range expansion on, some tail performance
loss is observed for DC only operation compared to the range expansion off. As
the Macro transmit power on F2 is reduced, we have different coverages on F1
and F2. Dual carrier operation forces the UE to be served by the same sector
on both F1 and F2 which explains the tail performance loss. However, after
enabling DF-DC, it is seen that consistent better performance is obtained
compared to range expansion off scenario.

Macro NodeB
In summary, simulation results show that, even for the mixed HetNet multi-
carrier deployments, range expansion by transmit power reduction on one
carrier still provided performance improvement. However, it should be
emphasized that the decision to lower the Macro transmit power should be made
while also considering the long term loading in the system. If a macro cell
that has LPNs deployed has neighbouring macro cells that are highly loaded any
without any LPNs, it may be better to avoid reduction of the transmit power
since it may add to the load discrepancy in the system. All range expansion
techniques need to be applied while taking into account the long-term loading
conditions in the system.
The levels to which the Macro transmit power is reduced are determined by the
network. For example, when the LPN power level is 24dBm, most of the benefits
can be obtained by reducing the Macro transmit power level to 30dBm on the
secondary carrier. In this case, an UL/DL imbalance of 6dB is observed. This
imbalance is the same as the UL/DL imbalance seen on the primary carrier as
described in clause 6 and the solutions identified in subclause 7.1 can also
be applied on the secondary carrier.
##### 7.2.2.5.6 Summary
  * The following conclusions can be drawn from the performance results shown in subclauses 7.2.2.5.1 to 7.2.2.5.5
  * Compared to a dual carrier HetNet co-channel deployment, range expansion significantly improves the system performance, especially the average UE throughput.
  * Further system performance benefit was observed by allowing DF-DC operation in addition to DC-only operation with range expansion. Compared to DC only operation, DF-DC operation improves the system fairness by significantly increasing the 5% UE throughput.
  * The impact of loss of DL coverage in a thermal noise limited system was also evaluated. The evaluation used a large percentile of indoor UEs with added Building Penetration Loss (BPL). Even with the indoor UE model, significant system performance gain was observed due to range expansion.
### 7.2.3 Decentralised biasing
In HetNet, the capacity gain is increased by offloading traffic from a Macro
to an LPN, utilising the scheduling resources of the LPN. This offloading can
be increased by biasing the UEs to hand over to the LPN at an earlier stage by
increasing the Cell Individual Offset (CIO) parameter, which effectively
expands the cell range of the LPN. Although this would increase the number of
UEs served by the LPN, the UEs being offloaded may suffer from poor geometry
especially when the biasing (i.e. CIO) value is large. Furthermore, capacity
gain may not be available to the offloaded UEs if the LPN does not have spare
capacity. Therefore, the gain of cell range expansion via biasing depends upon
the loading condition of the macro and LPN. A fixed uniform biasing where the
CIO for all LPNs is set to a fixed value would not be able to offer the
capacity gain that it is intended to do. It is therefore beneficial that the
biasing values (i.e. CIO values of the LPN) can be optimised according to the
condition of each cell. Moreover, the biasing value may be further optimized
accounting for UE receiver capacity or/and capability in addressing
interference.
In [37], centrally optimised biasing values based on loading conditions of
each cell are shown to improve the mean and 5% UE throughputs by 119% and 103%
respectively compared to a fixed uniform biasing value. A centralised
controller that can manage network wide biasing for all cells may not be
available, and therefore a decentralised biasing method is considered.
In the decentralised biasing method, measurement parameters such as SINR or
throughput are collected for all UEs in each cell by the network, and an
adaptation metric for each cell is computed based on these measurements.
Examples of suitable adaptation metrics are the 5% percentile UE SINR and 5%
percentile UE throughput. Using the adaptation metric, the network computes
the biasing value (CIO) for each cell. The updated CIO values are signalled to
the UEs. The rate of change of the biasing values is expected to be slow, e.g.
a few seconds. The details of a possible scheme can be found in Appendix B of
[37]. It is found in [37] that the decentralised biasing method is able to
give 112% to 119% average UE throughput gain and 77% to 88% 5% UE throughput
gain compared to using a fixed uniform biasing value.
The adaptation metrics from the cells need to be signalled to the RNC where
the biasing values can be updated, which would have some RAN3 impact. In
computing the adaptation metric, existing UE measurements can be used.
However, there may be some RAN1 and RAN2 impact if other UE measurements are
found to be beneficial in computing the adaptation metric. This feature would
be applicable for both single carrier and dual carrier deployments.
## 7.3 Combined cell
The main principle of combined cell is that a UE can move seamless within the
combined cell coverage without any RNC interaction. Figure 67 shows the system
architecture for the combined cell deployment, where all the nodes within a
combined cell are tightly coupled by high speed and low latency backhaul to a
central unit in the combined cell. For example, this central unit may be a
macro scheduling unit similar to a current main unit in main/remote base
station implementations. Coupling between various nodes is not a requirement
in the combined cell deployment. Note that in the combined cell deployment,
RNC connects to the central unit and is not aware of these different nodes.
For example, these nodes can be Remote Radio Units (RRUs). In the co-channel
deployment, scheduling is done per each cell while in a combined cell
scheduling is performed per combined cell. Hence, the scheduler decides which
nodes should transmit to a particular UE. Some of the mobility and resource
management operations performed in the RNC in the co-channel deployment will
be performed by the central scheduler in the combined cell deployment. For
example, the central scheduler tracks the UE between multiple nodes. Hence,
this configuration avoids the loading of RNC, while at the same time the
decisions and execution can be performed very fast (on TTI level). This
improves the overall performance of the network as well as the UE performance
(qualitatively and quantitatively).

nodes within a combined cell are tightly coupled and connected to the central
scheduler
### 7.3.1 Motivation of combined cell deployments
Since the introduction of LPNs does not create individual cells as in the co-
channel deployment, the following benefits can be achieved with the combined
cell deployment.
**1\. Handovers and Impact on End User Performance:** Since the LPNs are part
of combined cell, from a RNC perspective, the UE can move seamlessly within
the macro and LPN coverage areas that belong to the same combined cell,
without any handover. Hence, the number of handovers will be the same as that
of a homogenous network deployment (e.g., a macro-only deployment). Since
there are less handovers in this deployment, the probabilities as well as the
number of handover signalling failure are both reduced. Furthermore, this
results in less frequent RRC signalling. As a result, the end user performance
can be enhanced. For example, less dropped calls due to RRC signalling delay
or handover signalling failure.
**2\. Neighbour Cell List (NCL) Size:** Since in a combined cell deployment
the LPNs deployed within the Macro cell coverage area have the same L3 cell
Identity, i.e. for RNC the combined cell is considered as one L3 cell
Identity, so all LPNs that are deployed within the combined cell coverage area
including the Macro cell will have the same L3 cell Identity in the combined
cell deployment. Consequently, the current NCL size for a homogenous network
would be enough and there is no need to extend the NCL with the combined cell
deployment in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, because LPNs and Macro cell
share the same L3 cell identity in the combined cell deployment, the PSC
confusion problem could be avoided, especially when the number of LPNs
increases and consequently the network cell planning complexity will decrease.
**3\. Downlink/Uplink Imbalance:** The introduction of LPNs in a macro
coverage area can cause a downlink/uplink imbalance problem in a heterogeneous
network, when a UE is served by a strong macro downlink and has a stronger
uplink to the LPN. This might cause problems, for both uplink and downlink
control channels. Since in a combined cell deployment, both macro and LPN are
part of one combined cell, this problem can be avoided in the combined cell
deployment.
**4\. Interference Avoidance:** With the introduction of low power nodes, the
interference structure becomes more complex than in a homogenous network.
Since in a combined cell all the nodes are connected to a central node, the
interference can be avoided using co-ordinated scheduling.
**5\. Network Management:** With the introduction of low power nodes, the
network management, for example keep tracking of KPI, parameter tuning,
deployment strategies, become more complex. With combined cell, we can avoid
this problem as the network views these LPNs as part of one combined cell.
This is particularly appealing for network operators as they can reduce the
cost of deployment without compromising on the performance.
> **6\. Shadow fading effects** can be reduced in combined cell deployments
> for a large number of small cells [44].
### 7.3.2 Typical deployment scenarios and use cases
This subclause outlines a few typical deployment scenarios where combined cell
is attractive for heterogeneous deployments. Note that combined cell is not
only limited to these scenarios; it can be deployed in other scenarios as
well.
A. **High mobility between nodes:**
> These types of scenarios arise when a UE is moving at high speed between
> different nodes. For example as shown in Figure 68, the UE is moving between
> 3 nodes in a high mobility scenario (e.g. a high speed train). Hence,
> instead of treating these nodes as separate cells, if these 3 nodes are
> treated as one cell (e.g., combined cell), one can avoid the handovers
> between LPNs and the frequent signalling from RNC.
Figure 68: Combined cell deployment when a UE is moving between different
nodes with high speed
B. **In-Building deployments:**
> In certain existing deployments, in-building systems are deployed using
> distributed antennas which typically form one logical cell per floor. By
> deploying LPNs using the combined cell deployment one can reduce the
> neighbour list in the RNC.
C. **UE is in the vicinity of severe interference:**
> It is well known that the introduction of LPNs causes interference to legacy
> UEs. If the UE is connected to a LPN the performance may be impacted by the
> dominant interference from the macro node, hence the performance may be
> impacted severely. As shown in Figure 69, using the combined cell deployment
> avoids this problem by transmitting the same signal to the UE when the UE is
> in the vicinity of strong interfering node.
Figure 69: Combined cell deployment when the UE is in the vicinity of strong
interference
D. **Deployments where the number of LPNs is very large:**
> Another application of combined cell is when the number of LPNs is very
> large, for example, in public places such as shopping malls, train/subway
> stations, airports, stadiums, etc. By deploying LPNs in these places as a
> combined cell one can avoid the frequent handovers and a very large
> neighbour list.
### 7.3.3 Transmission modes
The downlink transmission modes can be divided into three types.
> **A. Single Frequency Network (SFN) mode:** This mode combines signals over
> the air from all nodes by means of transmitting exactly the same pilot
> channel, downlink control channels and downlink data channels using the same
> carrier frequency, spreading and scrambling codes. Figure 70 shows the
> conceptual diagram of this transmission mode, where we assumed one macro
> node and 3 LPNs are deployed in combined cell. Here only downlink physical
> channels which are relevant for the study are shown. The other downlink
> physical channels such as common control physical channel, synchronization
> channel, Acquisition Indicator Channel are not shown. They are transmitted
> either from all nodes or from a subset of nodes. Note that same colour code
> is used to indicate that same data is transmitted from all the nodes. Since
> in this mode, signal to noise ratio is improved by the addition of LPNs,
> this mode can be used for coverage improvements.
Figure 70: Downlink physical channel configuration in combined cell deployment
with SFN mode
> **B. Node Selection with Spatial Reuse:** Figure 71 shows the conceptual
> diagram of this mode, where it is assumed that one macro node and 3 LPN are
> deployed in a combined cell. Similar to the SFN mode, the same pilot signal
> P-CPICH is transmitted from all the nodes, thereby allowing this mode to
> serve the legacy users using this mode. The downlink control channels and
> the data traffic channels are scheduled to different UEs from different
> nodes, and are shown with different colour codes. Note that additional
> demodulation pilot channels are needed for data demodulation. Since the
> scheduling is done per combined cell, the central scheduler decides which
> nodes should transmit to the various UEs. Since each node can serve
> different UEs at the same time using same channelization codes, this mode
> can be used for capacity improvements.
Figure 71: Downlink physical channel configuration in combined cell deployment
with SR mode
**C. MIMO mode with spatially separated nodes:** Figure 72 shows the downlink
channel configuration for this mode. The combination of the nodes acts like
distributed MIMO, i.e. MIMO transmission with spatially separated nodes. For
simplicity we have shown only MIMO transmission from macro node and LPN-1 and
spatial reuse from LPN-2 and LPN-3. In this mode, it is expected that in
addition to the spatial re-use gains, MIMO gains (both diversity and
multiplexing gains) are possible. Hence this mode can be used for capacity
improvement when there are many MIMO capable UEs in the combined cell.

in MIMO mode with spatially separated nodes
### 7.3.4 System performance
The performance of combined cell deployment was evaluated via system and link
simulations. For system simulations full buffer traffic is assumed. System
simulation assumptions are summarized in Annex A.1 and system performance
evaluation metrics in Annex A.2. Link simulation assumptions are summarized in
Annex A.3. The gains are presented as the percentage increase over the
baseline throughput, where the baseline throughput is obtained when LPNs are
not present in the Macro cell.
#### 7.3.4.1 Single Frequency Network Mode
Figure 73 shows the average sector throughput vs. number of users per macro
node. The number of LPNs per Macro cell is 4. It can be observed that the
performance is improved at all loads. This is due to the increase in signal to
noise ratio with the addition of LPNs.
{width="4.660416666666666in" height="3.495138888888889in"}
Figure 73: Average sector throughput vs. number of users per macro node
Figure 74 shows the percentage of gain with respect to the case when no LPN is
deployed when we change the power of each LPN. The number of LPNs per Macro
cell is 4 with 16 UEs per Macro. Note that the gains decrease as we decrease
the power of each LPN as the SINR of the SFN channel is reduced when we reduce
the power of each LPN.

LPN power
It should be noted that figures 73 and 74 show the gains when the propagation
offsets have not been taken into account. The gains when propagation offsets
have been accounted for are shown in Table 55.
Further, when a continuous dedicated pilot is configured for the spatial re-
use mode (referred to as Solution II discussed later in section 7.3.4.2), the
available HS-PDSCH power is reduced. This would impact the gains as seen in
Table 86.

#### 7.3.4.2 Node selection with Spatial Reuse Mode
In a combined cell deployment, all the nodes transmit the same common pilot
(P-CPICH) and the UE computes the channel quality indicator (CQI) based on the
combined pilots. Hence the central node does not know where the UE is located
or which nodes should transmit data to this particular UE. This is similar to
cell selection in co-channel deployment, where the UE compares the pilot
strengths of each node and decide which cell is most suitable. Since in a
combined cell all the nodes have the same primary scrambling code, the UE
cannot distinguish between individual pilots. For identifying the best
suitable node for data transmission, two solutions are considered. The first
one is introducing new probing pilots which can be transmitted continuously at
a low power level, the other one is using demodulation pilots as probing
pilots with higher power.
##### 7.3.4.2.1 Solution I (using low power level probing pilots and
demodulation pilots)
Figure 75 shows the message sequence chart of this method. Assume that a
combined cell deployment consists of 4 Nodes serving multiple UEs (the same
procedure applies if the number of nodes is more than 4 or less than 4). A
reference signal which is unique to each node in a combined cell called
fractional CPICH (F-CPICH) is transmitted from each node simultaneously and
continuously. The F-CPICH is characterized by a spreading code (typically SF=
256) and a scrambling code which is either the primary scrambling code or a
secondary scrambling code of the combined cell. The F-CPICH channel power
levels may be indicated to the UE during the initial cell set up. In addition
to F-CPICH, the primary common pilot (P-CPICH) which is common to all the
nodes is continuously transmitted. From these two different pilot signals, the
UE estimates the channel and feeds back the channel quality information (CQI)
associated with these two pilots at two time intervals. Note that the CQI
estimated with F-CPICH indicates the channel quality corresponding to a
specific node, referred to hereafter as CQI~F~, and the CQI computed using
P-CPICH is the channel quality using the combined nodes, referred to hereafter
as CQI~P~. These two CQIs are time multiplexed and sent on the uplink feedback
channel HS-DPCCH. The same HS-DPCCH signal is received by all the nodes. The
central processing unit processes the received signal (HS-DPCCH) from all the
nodes. From CQI~F~ the central scheduler identifies which node the UE is close
to. Hence the scheduler informs the respective node to transmit to the UE. The
assigned node transmits the demodulation pilot channel (D-CPICH), downlink
control channel (HS-SCCH) and the downlink traffic channel (HS-PDSCH) to the
respective UE. Similarly, the central scheduler informs the other nodes to
transmit to the other UEs. Note that D-CPICH and F-CPICH use different
spreading codes and may have different power levels. For example, the power
level of F-CPICH may be relatively low and D-CPICH may be relatively high.
The effectiveness of F-CPICH and the corresponding CQI~F~ for cell association
has not been evaluated. The accuracy of the CQI reports would depend on the
measurement interval, the filtering length, and Ec/Ior for probing pilots. The
impacts due to the delays associated with cell selection that can result in
loss of opportunity to schedule the user from the right node and the
additional power allocated to probing pilots have also not been evaluated.
Therefore, the simulation gains presented in this section should be considered
as an upper bound.
When the scheduler relies on CQI~P~ to schedule HS-PDSCHs to the UE, some
inefficiencies may arise due to the distortion of the channel quality
information. The scheduler may employ CQI correction mechanisms to mitigate
this impact although some impact is expected due to estimation errors in the
SNR and can vary depending on the receiver implementation and the channel
profile. It should be noted however, that in the results presented, ideal
knowledge of the channel conditions from each cell to the UE have been
assumed.
There is additional complexity introduced in the UE when compared to co-
channel deployments. The UE would additionally have to:
  * Monitor F-CPICH channels and report the corresponding CQI~F~ in addition to the CQI reports on the P-CPICH channel
  * Implement an equalizer for F-CPICH in addition to P-CPICH for demodulation purposes. Depending on specific implementations, this could be significant increase in UE complexity.
  * Implement a mechanism for determining the cell from which the D-CPICH is transmitted. Depending on how this mechanism is specified the impact on complexity could be minimal.

Figure 75: Message sequence chart between the Nodes and the UE using Solution
I
##### 7.3.4.2.2 Solution II (using high power level demodulation pilots)
Figure 76 shows the message sequence chart of this solution. Assume that a
combined cell deployment consists of 4 Nodes serving multiple UEs (the same
procedure applies if the number of node is more than 4 or less than 4).
Instead of probing pilots, demodulation pilots are used from each node. In
addition all the nodes transmit the same pilot signal P-CPICH. Note that
channel sounding for CQI estimation is done on D-CPICH. From the D-CPICH
signal the UE estimates the channel and fed back the channel quality
information (CQI). The CQI information is sent in HS-DPCCH. The same HS-DPCCH
signal is received by all the nodes.
{width="5.928472222222222in" height="3.921527777777778in"}
Figure 76: Message sequence chart between the Nodes and the UE using Solution
II
The central processing unit processes the CQIs and identifies which node(s) a
UE is closest to. Hence the scheduler informs the respective node to transmit
to the UE. The assigned node transmits the downlink control channel (HS-SCCH)
and the downlink traffic channel (HS-PDSCH) to the respective UE. Note that in
this solution, D-CPICH needs to be continuously transmitted from each node
with a higher power as it is used for data demodulation.
The transmit power levels of the D-CPICH channels are the same as P-CPICH.
This ensures that the quality of the channel estimation is the same that
observed in legacy networks and consequently also ensures the quality of the
CQI report. The use of D-CPICH to report the CQI enables the network to avoid
additional CQI adjustments that are required in Solution 1.
Similar to Solution I, there is additional complexity introduced in the UE
when compared to co-channel deployments. In the case of Solution II, the UE
would additionally have to:
  * Monitor the D-CPICH channels and report the corresponding CQIs. This is in addition to the monitoring of the P-CPICH for mobility measurements and event reporting.
  * Implement an equalizer for D-CPICH in addition to P-CPICH.
  * Implement a mechanism for determining the cell that is transmitting data.
##### 7.3.4.2.3 System simulation results for Solution I
Figure 77 shows the percentages of gain with respect to homogeneous network
vs. number of users per macro node with uniform UE dropping. The number of
LPNs per Macro cell is 4. It can be observed that the performance is improved
at all loads except at 0.1 users per macro node. Similar to co-channel
deployment, the gains are mainly due to offloading and also the improved
geometry for those UE which are getting downlink transmission from LPN. The
performance with co-channel deployment is also shown. Without taking into
account the demodulation pilot (D-CPICH) overhead, the performance of spatial
reuse mode is slightly better compared to that of co-channel deployment. With
the addition of demodulation pilot overhead (-13 dB) i.e. 25% overhead in
total, the gains due to combined cell reduce as the power allocated for HS-
PDSCH is less. Hence a slight degradation is observed in Figure 77.

##### 7.3.4.2.4 System simulation results for Solution II
Table 87 shows the percentage of gains achieved with Solution II. Note that in
this scheme the gains are smaller compared to solution I. This is due to the
additional pilot overhead of D-CPICH (-10 dB).

##### 7.3.4.2.5 Link simulation results for Solution I and Solution II
Figure 78 shows the user placement assumed when analyzing the gains achieved
with spatial reuse mode via link simulations. The macro node is placed at the
center of the hexagon and the LPN is placed on the line joining the macro to a
hexagon's corner. We consider 8 user locations indexed from 1-8 in Fig. 68.
Locations 1-4 are close to the LPN while locations 5-8 are distributed in the
hexagon's sector. A 57-cell network simulator to calculate the received Ior
(Macro), Ior (LPN) and the Ioc values (includes contribution from other macro-
cells with 20% loading) is considered. In these simulations, we assume a 30
dBm transmit power for the LPN-cell and use 3GPP path loss models.
Figure 78: User placement configuration
The geometry (macro/LPN) is defined as the ratio of the Ior (macro/LPN) to the
Ioc, where Ioc does not include the contribution for the other cell
(LPN/macro). This quantity is tabulated in Table 88. Different path delays
between the macro and LPN result in an offset of the LPN-signal relative to
the macro-signal at the user. Assuming the speed of light _c_ , this offset
$\text{Î”t}$ is given by,
$\text{Î”t} = (d_{P} - d_{M}\frac{)}{c}$,
where $d_{P}$, $d_{M}$ denote the distances to the LPN and the macro-cell from
the user. The offsets are tabulated in Table 88 both in nanoseconds and UMTS
chips (260ns/chip).

For the settings of spatial reuse mode and co-channel heterogeneous network
modes, two users are simulated in the network. The first user is always
allocated to the Macrocell and the second user is allocated to the LPN. The
link simulation results from [45] and [46] are shown in tables 89-91.
Tables 89 and 90 show the percentage of gain/loss compared to the Macro only
case for solutions I and II.
In Table 89, up to 50% gains and losses up to 95% over a Macro deployment can
be seen.

Due to additional power of D-CPICH which is set to -10 dB, the gains are
somewhat less compared to solution I where the power overhead due to F-CPICH
is -16 dB and D-CPICH is -13 dB.
In Table 90, up to 55% gains and losses up to 95% over a macro deployment can
be seen.

Table 91 shows the link throughout comparison with solution I and solution II
from [46] In these results, gains as high as 66% are obtained over macro-only
network when solution II is considered. This corresponding highest gain for
solution I is 59%. For both these solution, the highest gain was observed when
Users 1 and 2 are placed at locations **L** 5 and L4 and associated to macro
and low power node respectively. Compared with solution I, we observe 4-10%
additional gains for solution II at most of the highlighted locations. It is
worthwhile to note that these gains are obtained in spite of the fact that
extra power is allocated to D-PICH, reducing the available HS power. This
extra power allocation to the control channels might be the reason the
performance of the enhanced proposal is still lower than the co-channel
heterogeneous network deployment by 8-11% at most locations.

Further evaluation of the downlink UE performance with the Type 3i receiver
follows. The propagation delay is modeled according to UE location, Macro node
location, and LPN location shown in Figure 78. UEs operating in the combined
cell spatial reuse mode use D-CPICH for channel estimation. For pilot solution
I, D-CPICH has Ec/Ior of -13 dB and F-CPICH has Ec/Ior of -16dB with a 25%
activity factor, and for pilot solution II, D-CPICH has Ec/Ior of -10 dB. In
these simulations, the UEs are scheduled continuously and thus D-CPICH is
transmitted in all TTIs. This allows the UE to use D-CPICH for CQI estimation.
A summary of simulation assumptions that differ from Annex A.3 is shown in
Table 92.

Results are summarized in Table 93, for combined cell pilot solutions I and
II. It is assumed that User1 is always served by the Macro node and User2 is
served by the LPN. Both User1 and User2 are equipped with a Type 3i receiver
in both the Macro-only and combined cell deployments. For the Macro-only case,
a round-robin scheduler is used to schedule the two users; thus each user gets
50% of the radio resources in time. It can be seen that in either case,
combined cell spatial reuse improves over the macro-only deployment
significantly for many of the UE location combinations. Compared to the co-
channel deployment however, there is a small loss, due to the additional pilot
overhead needed to support combined-cell spatial reuse. Although the spatial
reuse gain in combined cell is slightly smaller than in co-channel, combined
cell offers much improved mobility performance and mobility management in a
heterogeneous network. Thus, the combined-cell deployment could be used as a
good complimentary solution to the co-channel deployment to help manage the
mobility aspects of the network.

reuse compared to macro-only and co-channel deployments

##### 7.3.4.2.6 Conclusions on performance of Spatial Reuse Mode
Both system level simulations and link level simulations have shown
significant throughput gains with spatial reuse mode as compared to the macro
only network. Compared to the co-channel deployment, there is an 8 \-- 11%
loss due to the additional pilot overhead in spatial reuse mode.
### 7.3.5 Legacy UE performance in combined cell
The SFN mode is used for data transmission to a legacy UE. One potential issue
with the SFN mode is the increased delay spread due to the propagation delay
difference between transmitting nodes. Due to propagation delay the combined
channel impulse response (CIR) becomes longer due to different propagation
delays between two nodes. Note that when the LPNs are co-located with macro
node the propagation delay mismatch does not occur.
Another issue with SFN mode is that there might be some performance loss due
to the additional pilot overhead when some Release 12 UEs are in the network.
To understand the performance of the legacy UE in combined cell, system level
simulations and link level simulations were carried out.
#### 7.3.5.1 System level analysis
In system level simulations 4 LPNs per macro cell is assumed. The statistics
are collected for 16 UEs per cell. Table 94 shows the percentage of loss
compared to the macro only case with ISD of 500 m. It can be observed that the
legacy UEs which are served in the SFN mode may not get benefit with LPN
deployment. One could expect a loss in user throughput due to the additional
pilot overhead propagation delay mismatch, but from Table 94 it is seen that
the percentage of loss is small. A loss of 5.7% is observed at the cell edge,
while a loss of 2.4% is observed in mean user throughput. The percentage of
loss might be increased if the ISD is increased to 1.73 km.

#### 7.3.5.2 Link level analysis
The simulation setup is the same as described in subclause 7.3.4.2 5 (see
Figure 78 and Table 88).
The achievable gains when the UE operates in SFN mode are shown in [47] and
[48]. Table 95 summarizes the results from [47] The gains were shown for two
cases. The first case is when the propagation offset is set to zero, and the
second case is when the propagation offset is set according to Table 88. Note
that in both cases the pilot overhead is set to -16 dB (i.e. solution I of
spatial reuse mode in Section 7.3.5.1). As can be observed from Table 95 the
impact due to propagation delay and pilot overhead is very small. There are
some cases where the SFN mode will give gains, while in some cases there might
be some losses due to propagation mismatch.

#### 7.3.5.3 Performance of legacy users with spatial reuse
A legacy UE uses the P-CPICH, which is transmitted by all nodes in a combined
cell, for channel quality indicator (CQI) estimation as well as for channel
estimation. Consider the example illustrated in Figure 79, where two UEs are
in locations where the received signal is dominated by the signal only from
one transmit node. As shown, based on the P-CPICH, UE-A sees two strong paths
and one weak path (colored in red) from the Macro node and one additional weak
path (colored in purple) from the LPN. Similarly, UE-B sees two strong paths
(colored in purple) from the LPN and one weak path (colored in red) from the
macro node.
When the HS-PDSCH channel is transmitted using the SFN mode, the multipath
delay profile for the P-CPICH signal matches that of HS-PDSCH as illustrated
in Figure 80. However, in this case, UE-A and UE-B need to be either code-
division multiplexed, sharing the OVSF codes of HS-PDSCH, or time-division
multiplexed, served in different TTIs. In either case, the same radio
resources cannot be used to serve both UE-A and UE-B in the same TTI.

Figure 80: Multipath delay profile of P-CPICH matches that of HS-PDSCH in the
SFN mode.
In the scenario illustrated in Figure 79, the network may actually reuse the
same radio resource to serve UE-A and UE-B in the same TTI. This results,
however, in a propagation channel mismatch between P-CPICH and HS-PDSCH as
illustrated in Figure 81. SR gives rise to what is called the cell-splitting
gain. However, for legacy UEs a mismatch between the multipath delay profiles
of P-CPICH and HS-PDSCH will result in degradation due to inaccurate channel
parameter estimation (e.g. estimation of path delay and coefficient and CQI).
However, if the mismatch is small due to that the paths from the other
transmit nodes are weak, the benefits of spatial reuse can be preserved to a
large extent. For the general deployment case with RRUs deployed within a
Macro area a number of observations can be made:
  * To get the cell-splitting gain, users that can be scheduled simultaneously need to exist. This essentially means that there needs to be users with sufficient isolation between them.
  * Gains can be obtained even though simultaneously schedulable users cannot be found. The ability to mute, or rather not transmitting HS-PDSCH from certain nodes, will decrease the inter cell interference and is beneficial from an energy savings point of view.
  * For legacy users in the Macro served area, it is rather simple to find good candidates that benefit from re-use of resources, whereas for users in the LPN served area, it can be more difficult to find good candidates. The reason is that the strong Macro signal creates potentially strong interference in the LPN area, whereas the weak LPN signal disturbs Macro area users much less.
  * The central scheduler needs to know what users that are good candidates for joint scheduling. Since there are no probing pilots, or dedicated demodulation pilots available for legacy users, one needs to rely on other information. For example, uplink measurements can be used to estimate the isolation between different transmission nodes.
Another observation is that the operation of SR for legacy users can be
combined with the true SR concept for Rel-12 users (supporting demodulation
pilots). Hence, a legacy user in the Macro serving area can, for example, be
paired with a SR supporting user in the LPN serving area. Consequently, even
though significant capacity improvements can be offered to legacy users by
enabling SR, the gains are expected to increase even further with the
introduction of true SR supporting users. Enabling SR for legacy users should
be seen as a way of providing capacity enhancements for legacy users, but the
true SR mode with additional pilots is required to achieve general
improvements, and a capacity on-par with co-channel.

Figure 81: Multipath delay profile of P-CPICH does not match that of HS-PDSCH
in the spatial reuse (SR) mode.
For particular deployment scenarios, the gain of enabling SR for legacy users
can be significant while the operation can be simpler. Two examples are given
in Figure 82. In the highway scenario, it is more straightforward to find good
candidates that would benefit from joint scheduling and re-use of resources.
In the example below, three LPNs are deployed in a combined cell fashion, and
it is likely that users 1-3 can be scheduled simultaneously using the same
resources. In addition to the typical combined cell benefits, e.g. improved
mobility, this offers large capacity improvements compared to scheduling them
one and one in a TDM manner. Similar benefits can be found in the in-building
scenario, where the floor/ceiling provides natural isolation between different
transmission nodes.

#### 7.3.5.4 System level analysis of legacy users with spatial reuse
The performance of legacy users with spatial reuse enabled within a combined
cell is evaluated. For the combined-cell deployment, it is assume that either
25% or 30% power is consumed by overhead channels (i.e. combined cell pilot
Solution I and II in Section 7.3.4.2). For the macro-only and co-channel
deployments, 20% of the total power is assumed for overhead channels. The
baseline case is taken without any deployment of LPNs. In the simulation
results, average, median, and 5-percentile user throughout performance is
provided. The main simulation parameters are stated in Annex A.1. Additional
assumptions can be found in Table 97.

In contrast to the SFN case where all links in the combined cell are used for
HS-PDSCH transmissions, the SR mode allows multiple UEs to be served in the
same TTI, and each UE is served by only a subset of the nodes in a combined
cell. In this case, the network only uses links that have signal strength
above a threshold, which is determined as the best available link's signal
strength minus a parameter, namely the Isolation Offset. Choosing a large
Isolation Offset corresponds to pure SFN since all links will be employed for
serving one user, whereas a small Isolation Offset means that one or a few
links will be used to serve each user. The latter choice facilitates spatial
reuse (SR) for legacy users but is less robust against the channel mismatch.
When scheduling a SR enabled legacy UE in a specific TTI, all resources or
channel codes at the ports transmitting to the UE will be occupied and not
available for other UEs in this specific TTI. This means that only UEs that
use different ports may be scheduled simultaneously. To balance the possible
mismatch between the channel estimation and the true channel from the
transmitting links, a CQI adjustment based on HARQ statistics is used.
Figure 83 shows results with 25% control channel overhead and Figure 84
depicts results with 30% control channel overhead. In the figures, the
following labels are used: Mac -- macro-only; Co-ch -- co-channel; SFN \--
single frequency network; SR -- spatial reuse using demodulation pilots; SR-
L-x -- spatial reuse for legacy users with Isolation Offset equal to x. From
the figures, it can be seen that when spatial reuse is enabled for legacy UEs
in the same combined cell, it is possible to achieve a significantly higher
throughput than the macro-only deployment. Furthermore, there is a
considerably increased throughput compared to the pure SFN case, and
improvements are observed for the mean, the median and for the 5^th^
percentile user throughput. However, by comparing the performance between SR
for legacy users and SR for Rel-12 UEs, it can be noted that the channel
mismatch between P-CPICH and HS-PDSCH results in a significant degradation for
the legacy UEs. The setting of the Isolation Offset will be a trade-off
between cell splitting gains and robustness against the channel mismatch.
Depending on the scenario, the performance of SR enabled legacy users will be
somewhere in between SFN and pure SR. It should also be noted that in the
simulations, ideal node selection is used. This will give a slightly better
performance for the SR enabled UEs than what would be the case in a real
system, where node selection would be based on UL measurements.

In Figure 85, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of
scheduled UEs per TTI and cell is depicted. It can be seen that as the
Isolation Offset is decreased, the number of simultaneously scheduled users in
the same combined cell increases. Note that even for SFN and macro-only cases,
the average number of simultaneously scheduled users per macro cell may be
slightly greater than 1, due to code-multiplexing. Furthermore when the
Isolation Offset is decreased, the number of HARQ transmissions increases (see
Figure 86), indicating an increasing channel mismatch.

From the simulation results, it is clear that enabling SR for legacy users has
a good potential to increase capacity compared to SFN. However, to reach a
performance matching the co-channel case, the new combined cell pilots are
needed.
#### 7.3.5.5 Conclusions on legacy UE performance
SFN mode is primarily used for legacy users. When the propagation delay
offsets between different transmitting nodes are not accounted for, there is a
gain of up to 30% seen for legacy users in link simulations and gains of
around 6-17% in system simulations.
However, when practical propagation offsets are considered, the gains are
reduced. System level simulation results have shown a loss of around 5.7%,
while link level simulation results show that the loss is around 6% for
solution I and around 25% for solution II. This loss is observed in the
Pedestrian A channel and is smaller for other multipath channels.
Furthermore, it has been shown that also legacy users can enjoy the benefits
of spatial reuse. Though channel mismatches between P-CPICH and HS-PDSCH
result in degradation compared to the case of the SR deployment (no channel
mismatch), legacy UEs still experience higher average throughput compared to
the pure SFN or Macro only scenario. Consequently, enabling SR for legacy
users can provide significant capacity enhancements for legacy users, but the
true SR mode with additional pilots is required to achieve general
improvements, and a capacity on-par with co-channel.
#### 7.3.5.6 IPICH based solution for combined cells
There has been some inefficiency in Spatial Reuse mode compared to the
conventional HetNets due to the need for additional pilots for demodulation.
Further, optimal node selection still stands as a challenge unless DPICH
signals are continuously transmitted for CQI feedback. However, such a
continuous DPICH transmission reduces the amount of available HS power when
legacy users are scheduled.
In this section, a more robust approach to SR mode design is considered where
continuous pilots (referred to as IPICH (Identification pilot channel) are
transmitted. These are used for CQI computation at the UE and are transmitted
at a much lower level than CPICH and DPICH.
Thus, when legacy users are scheduled, there is a smaller reduction in the
available HS power. The motivation is that CQI computation might not need the
high pilot levels as data demodulation. In addition to legacy user performance
in SFN mode, node selection in SR mode is elaborated using link level
simulations when nodes are dynamically selected based on a network-throughput
maximization rule that uses the reported CQI information. The performance is
compared against the case where the nodes are statically selected by a genie
(based on exact path losses).
##### 7.3.5.6.1 System Model
Figure 87 indicates the SFN mode that is the proposed mode of operation for
the legacy users in a combined cell in the presence of IPICH that is discussed
below.

Figure 87: Operation of combined cell during TTI when legacy user is scheduled
(SFN)
Details for the SR mode with IPICH are presented below. The three different
pilots are used as shown in Figure 88.
  * P-CPICH (Primary common pilot channel)
    * It is continuously transmitted from Macro and LPN.
    * All the mobility triggers are based on P-CPICH measurements at UE, similar to the legacy UMTS system.
  * IPICH (Identification pilot channel)
    * Additional pilot channel for CQI estimation from each cell within a combined cell.
    * It is continuously transmitted from Macro and LPN(s). It is desirable to be transmitted at a lower power level compared to P-CPICH to minimize the overhead.
    * LPN(s) and Macro have a different IPICH (by assigning different channelization codes). It should be noted that for scenarios with a large number of LPN nodes, the number of channelization codes could become a constraint for this scheme.
    * UE reports all the obtained CQIs from LPN(s) and Macro to NodeB. Based on all the reported CQIs, the network determines the transmission mode (between SFN and spatial-reuse) and cell selection to transmit for each UE.
  * DPICH (Demodulation pilot channel)
    * Additional pilot channel for data demodulation from cell(s) that transmit HS data.
    * It will be transmitted only when HS data is transmitted in SR mode.
    * HS data demodulation can be further enhanced by combining DPICH and IPICH. However, DPICH was only used for HS demodulation in this contribution for simplicity.

##### 7.3.5.6.2 HSDPA link analysis for SFN mode (legacy user)
Throughput results are presented for the legacy user in SFN mode for different
levels of IPICH -13dB, -16 dB, -19 dB and -22 dB. Table 98 shows the actual
throughputs and Table 99 the gains that can be achieved. As expected, lowering
the IPICH level increases the HSDPA throughputs by increasing the available HS
power. The maximum gain of SFN mode varies from 23% (with realistic
propagation offsets) for an IPICH level of -22 dB and decreases to as low as
4% when IPICH is increased to -13 dB.
However, the IPICH power level also determines accuracy of cell selection. SR
user throughputs are analysed for different levels of IPICH in clause
7.3.5.6.3. The exact choice will possibly depend on the capabilities of SR
users.

Remarks
The analysis for SFN mode of operation for combined cells in a modified scheme
where continuous IPICHs are enabled for SR users\' CQI computation is
presented. The maximum gain of SFN mode varies from 23% (with realistic
propagation offsets) for an IPICH level of -22 dB and decreases to as low as
4% when IPICH is increased to -13 dB. However, the level of IPICH depends on
the node selection ability for SR users which is discussed in clause
7.3.5.6.3.
##### 7.3.5.6.3 HSDPA link analysis for SR users using IPICH
Throughput results are presented for the SR mode for different levels of
IPICH_Ec/Ior at -16 dB, -19 dB and -22 dB. One macro/one LPN with two users
are considered for the analysis. From Tables 100 (actual throughputs) and 101
(% gain), different schemes are evaluated.
  * The macro-only mode of operation uses an equal scheduling time for the two users at the two specified locations. Note that there is no LPN interference in this case.
  * The SR scheme (Genie) has the first user associated to macro and second user associated with LPN. Note that this is optimal allocation to maximize the sum throughput in a static sense. In this case, the IPICH channels are not transmitted.
  * The proposed SR scheme (with IPICH) utilizes IPICH at the specified level to perform node selection. To avoid reactions to fast fades, a filtering is applied onto the computed CQI based on received IPICH at NodeB. Node B chooses the serving nodes to maximize the sum throughput based on the filtered CQI values (for the macro and LPN) from the two users. An IIR filtering was used with appropriate time constants to filter CQI. It should be noted that the node selection is based on the filtered CQI to maximize the sum throughput, but actual TBS scheduling is based on CQI before the filtering.
  * The HetNet scheme assumes the same serving cell association to users as SR scheme (Genie). Note that the practical serving cell selection in HetNet is based on P-CPICH at -10 dB Ec/Ior.
Important observations are summarized below.
  * Significant gains are obtained by using the SR mode with IPICH (79% max) and HetNet mode (88% max) compared to macro-only case.
  * For the IPICH_Ec/Ior value of -22 dB with 100ms filtering for CQI, the performance close to SR with genie node selection is obtained. This is promising since this level of IPICH offers to optimize the gains in the Single Frequency Network mode. However, it is unclear whether such a low transmit power level of the IPICH would be applicable for other channel conditions. A more conservative choice of -16dB or perhaps -19dB may be more appropriate.
  * Increase in filtering time improves the SR (with IPICH) throughputs by improving the robustness to node selection.
  * Decrease in IPICH_Ec/Ior is expected to have two effects for SR users: increase the available HS power, decrease reliability of node selection. A slight improvement in performance suggests that even low transmit power levels of IPICH could offer a reasonable node selection capability with filtering. However, a more thorough evaluation for other channel types may be necessary in order to reach a final conclusion.

Remarks
The analysis for SR mode of operation for combined cells with a modified
proposal where a continuous IPICH is transmitted for the serving node
selection is presented. It is shown that IPICH (even at levels as low as -22
dB but with appropriately long filtering of 100ms for CQI) is effective in
obtaining the throughputs for SR mode close to SR with a genie node selection.
The maximum gains obtained are 79% while the co-channel HetNet offers up to
88% maximum gains. Note that the SR mode still has the DPICH overhead (-10 dB)
that reduces the available HS power, and it causes some performance loss
compared to the HetNet mode.
## 7.4 Mobility aspects
### 7.4.1 Solutions to small cell discovery and identification
This subclause describes some solutions identified so far. Some solutions
including the proximity detection have been investigated in LTE; see 3GPP TR
36.839 [25].
1\. UE based proximity detection
Proximity based mechanism was introduced for CSG cell detection and
measurement, in which autonomous search function is used to determine when and
where to search for the member CSG cells, similar mechanism could also be
extended to small cell discovery, and could be divided to several options
[11].
Based on UE implementation (e.g. the fingerprint info), UE is able to
determine that it is near a small cell and may provide to the network a
proximity indication, the network could configure the compressed mode gaps for
the UE to measure the inter-frequency small cells. The difference from CSG
case is that there is no \"CSG whitelist\" for small cells, and the small
cells are open and deployed in the public place, so how to maintain feasible
fingerprint info might be a challenge.
2\. Network based proximity detection
As described in [8], [10], [11] and [26], proximity detection for inter-
frequency small cells for UEs in the vicinity areas of Macro or small cells is
performed by the macro network or small cell through detecting the uplink
signal of UEs which are near the small cells in CELL DCH, upon being detected
by macro network or small cell, the UEs are further commanded to initiate
inter-frequency measurements towards small cells. Here the main challenge is
how to determine those nearby candidate UEs, Round Trip Time (as used in
location based service, for example) measurements, information on Active Set
or pre-configured information, e.g., fingerprint info, are possible ways.\ The
network can perform the proximity detection based on the existing measurement
report on the serving carrier. Based on the detected proximity information,
the network will make decision about when to activate the inter-frequencies
measurements.
3\. UE detects small cell with network assistance
The basic approach here is for the network to indicate the information of the
presence of small cells to the UEs, such info could help the UE to detect the
small cells nearby, in other words, network provides, the fingerprint info for
example, for the UE to use, which could improve the discovery efficiency and
save the power consumption. Such info could include (precise or approximate)
location info of the small cell(s) overlaid with the Macro cell, or distance
info of small cells towards Macro cells either in RSCP or in pathloss, or even
the frequency info of the small cell with which UE could use DRX to perform
background search. In general, the intention is to try to reduce the impact on
power consumption and data transmission introduced by proximity detection.
4\. Relaxed and limited measurements for UE in Non DCH state
The basic approach of this method is that the measurements towards
interfrequency cells are changed:
a. The network could request the UE to perform Inter-frequency measurements
for a limited period of time when entering non DCH states to save battery
power [15].
b. Also some relaxed inter-frequency measurements for cell reselection can be
used as described in [15][32].
5\. Configurable NCL in CELL_PCH and CELL_FACH
When the UE is in CELL_FACH or CELL_PCH, the Network can change the NCL of the
UE using dedicated signalling, cells can be added or removed from the list
broadcasted in the SIB on a per UE basis [15]

### 7.4.2 Solutions to the mobility performance degradation caused by high UE
speed
This subclause describes some solutions identified so far
([7][8][9][12][14][16][17][18][35]). Possible solutions achievable by proper
NW configuration and/or implementation are not covered.
1\. Solution to more signalling messages
To keep the Macro cell always in the active set will reduced the handover
procedures for the UE travelling across the Macro cell, i.e., when UE enters
the coverage of small cell, the UE will not report 1b, and the active set
update procedure for removing Macro cell from active set will not be
triggered. When UE moves out of the small cell coverage, the UE will not need
to report 1a for adding Macro cell into the active set.
2\. Solution based on UE speed knowledge
This approach firstly requires the knowledge of UE speed information. UE speed
information could be estimated through the statistics of the frequency of cell
reselection or active set changes, some additional info, e.g., cell size or
cell type (Macro cell or small cell), could help the estimation to be more
accurate.
Assuming an accurate knowledge of the UE speed, in CELL DCH, NCL could be
allocated dynamically based on UE speed in order to make the best use of
existing NCL size. Dynamically allocating NCL for medium and high speed UE
could decrease number of measurement reports and improve HO performance.
3\. Solutions to avoid handover or reselection to small cells without using
speed estimation.
In CELL_DCH state it is possible to configure measurements in order that some
measurement events are applicable to small cells and others to Macro cells --
this can be done using the existing \"cells for measurement\" IE, or in case
NCL needs to be extended it is possible to allocate extended values to small
cells while using the existing NCL for Macro cells. By configuring those
applicable to small cells to use, e.g. longer TTT, different CIO, or
hysteresis/threshold values it is possible to trigger small cells measurement
events when UE is at a relatively low speed or in good conditions without
affecting the Macro cell measurements. This approach can be studied, for
example, to cover cases of active set update, multiflow.
In Idle, PCH, FACH is also possible to use separate thresholds or CIO, longer
Treselection for small cells, or use uplink coverage as well as downlink
coverage when performing cell reselection calculation.
4\. Additional cell information per cell in NCL in CELL_DCH
Some information elements can be added in the NCL. The UE may use all or a
subset of the proposed parameters and report measurements back to the network.
The network may use these measurements to enable better decision making in
HetNet environments. Some possible information are: LPN power class for the UE
to know that the cell is low power node; LPN timing offset, to help the UE
cell search; LPN UL desensitization, for the UE to estimate UL/DL imbalance;
compensation factor for UE to calculate boosting factor for UL channels e.g.
HS-DPCCH; cell specific Time to Trigger.

### 7.4.3 Solutions to the issues of massive deployment of small cells
There are some solution alternatives or suggestions to PSC confusion which
have been discussed and suggested in [7][8][9][13][18][20][21].
1\. Extend the Neighbour Cell List (NCL) size
Actually this method is not for addressing PSC confusion but for NCL size
limitation. The main motivation of extending the size of NCL is to allow the
network to include all the small cells in the NCL so that UE could report each
detected small cell to the network side. More issues, however, might be
expected in this solution, e.g., how many additional entries could be extended
on top of existing size of NCL, should the measurement requirement be updated
or not, etc.
2\. Measurement event specific cell lists
The basic approach would be that a list of cells apply to some measurement
events (e.g. the current NCL in CELL_INFO_LIST containing Macro cells), and
another list of cells apply for other measurement events (e.g. an extension to
CELL_INFO_LIST containing PLN cells).

cells

Solution Power Consumption Performance Specification impact Complexity Impact
node 1) It depends on the number of added cells. In general, with a reasonable
size extension of the current NCL, it is a reasonable solution with good
performance if RAN4 requirements could be maintained. RAN2 and RAN4 would be
impacted Low complexity for network, the main updates inside the UE is
measurement behaviour and requirement. UE and RNC 2) Should not be
significant. Some mobility performance improvements could be expected, pending
on the detailed solution. Mainly RAN2, e.g., a new CELL_INFO_LIST for small
cell and some other new IEs need to be introduced pending on the detailed
solution. Medium. UE & RNC

### 7.4.4 Mobility aspects related with combined cell
As described in [24], in a combined cell deployment the Macro cell and LPNs
that are deployed within the combined cell coverage area will have the same L3
cell identity, and consequently the UE only needs to discover and identify the
combined cell (which includes LPNs deployed within the combined cell coverage
area). There is no need to discover and identify each LPN individually. Hence,
as far as cell discovery and identification are concerned, the UE will behave
as it is in a macro-only network and combined cell deployment can complement
co-channel deployment to improve the mobility performance of a heterogeneous
network.
7.4.4.1 Hand Over aspects in combined cell deployment
For combined cell deployment, in any transmission mode, see 7.3.4, no HO
occurs between LPNs or between a LPN and the macro cell within the coverage of
combined cell. Since there is no HO between Macro cell and LPN neither between
the LPNs within the combined cell, the robustness of the serving cell change
is improved in combined cell deployment compared to co-channel deployment
[30].
In SFN transmission mode, see 7.3.4, a subset of or all the LPNs in a combined
cell are selected to transmit the same signalling in parallel which improves
the transmission robustness for the HO signalling messages, which improves the
HO performance especially for UEs with a limited coverage area.
In the SR transmission mode, see 7.3.4, the central scheduler select the node
which has the best link to transmit HO signalling which will increase the
robustness of the HO performance and improve the resource utilization of the
Macro cell.
It is important to select the most suitable transmission modes to transmit HO
signalling in combined cell. The selection of the transmission nodes can be
switched on a TTI basis. Hence, the transmission node or transmission mode
could be different for different RLC (re)transmission attempts for the same HO
signalling message. In addition, adding LPNs in combined cell nullifies the
impact of shadow fading due to the combined reception of the P-CPICH signals
from all nodes and reduce the number of HOs compared to macro cell only case
and also compared the co-channel deployment case [31].
Hence, the introduction of LPNs does not affect the number of HOs in combined
cell compared to Macro only networks. In addition fewer HOs are triggered
compared to the co-channel deployment, see [31]. The HO performance
improvement in combined cell is especially important for a high speed UE.
7.4.4.2 Primary Scrambling Code in combined cell deployment
Since in a combined cell deployment the LPNs deployed within the combined cell
coverage area have the same primary scrambling code, then only one PSC is
needed to identify the combined cell including the macro cell and all LPNs
that are deployed within the combined cell coverage area and sharing the same
cell identity. Hence, there is a clear benefit with combined cell deployment
to avoid the PSC confusion problem.
7.4.4.3 Neighbour Cell List in combined cell deployment
In a combined cell deployment the LPNs deployed within the combined cell
coverage area have the same L3 cell identity as the macro cell, from RNC
perspectives, hence the entire combined cell is considered as one L3 cell
identity. Consequently there is no need to increase the NCL size due to the
deployment of LPNs, this helps to avoid the potential extension of NCL size in
heterogeneous networks.
### 7.4.5 Solutions to the issues of Multiflow and multi-carrier operation
Since there may be an issue of inefficient secondary serving cell change
during multi-carrier operation in HetNet deployment, some enhancements could
be considered. Here we provide examples of issues and possible solutions.
{width="5.3284722222222225in" height="2.325in"}
Figure 89: Range expansion scenario by reducing Macro power
In the first example in [33], as illustrated in Figure 89, the UE is working
in DC-HSDPA operation and the macro cell on frequency 2 is the serving cell
and the macro cell on frequency 1 is the secondary serving cell. If the UE
moves toward the small cell on frequency 2, the UE may trigger event 1D on
this carrier and then the serving cell is changed to that cell.
In order to optimize the handover performance for the above use case, for the
UE supporting inter-frequency measurements without compressed mode and
independent event reporting on the secondary carrier, it is suggested to use
inter-frequency measurement events in order for changing of the best cell to
the secondary carrier. For this procedure, the serving cell will be changed
from the macro cell on frequency 2 to the macro cell on frequency 1 instead of
the small cell on frequency 2.
In addition, the time for inter-frequency handover procedure will be shorter
as the network does not have to configure event 2d in order to know how bad
the used frequency is.
In the second example in [34], also illustrated in Figure 89, it would be
efficient to transition from DC to DF-DC as soon as the quality of the
secondary carrier cell from the neighbor Node B becomes good enough, for
example when it becomes better than current secondary cell. In this regard it
would be desirable that the UE could notify the RNC when certain measurement
events (e.g. change of best cell, pilot entering/leaving an ASET reporting
range) happen on the secondary carrier, similarly to what is defined for DC-
HSUPA (specifically, events 1a, 1b and 1c on the secondary carrier can be
reported when DC-HSUPA is configured).As illustrated above, let us assume a UE
moves from the macro cell to the small cell on frequency 2, starting in DC
mode, with F1 as the anchor carrier.
  1. If we rely on the existing mobility mechanism applied to the anchor carrier, DF-DC could be triggered by event 1a. The triggering process is not efficient though: in the specific case above, an event 1a will not be triggered until UE enters the SHO region near the DL boundary of F1. At that point, the UE can be switched to DF-DC by RNC blindly, or after an MCM instructing the UE to perform an inter-frequency measurement (e.g. using compressed mode).
By adding new event triggering functionalities, e.g. event 1d reporting (best
cell change) on the secondary carrier, the RNC could reconfigure the UE from
DC to DF-DC much earlier than waiting for an event 1a on the primary carrier
(as with legacy mobility). As such, it will increase the performance gains of
DF-DC because DF-DC region is extended. Note that when receiving an event 1d
on F2, the RNC would perform both anchor carrier switch (from F1 to F2) and
DF-DC reconfiguration, so that both cells on the anchor carrier (F2) can be in
SHO (it would not be possible on F1).
To efficiently exploit the described benefits of independent event reporting
on the secondary carrier (i.e. not triggered by events on the anchor carrier),
it is important to minimize or avoid performance issues due to periodic or
long inter-frequency compressed mode gaps.
# 8 Impact on specifications
For co-channel deployments, for the support of enhanced quality of pilots in
the uplink, the solution of boosting the existing channels requires setting
the rules when to apply boosting, while the solution of adding of a new pilot
channel requires the specification of such channel. The impact is on RAN1/2/3
specifications.
For the support of E-TFC selection backoff for uplink SI, rules for applying
the backoff need to be specified. The impact is on RAN2 specifications.
For the support of decentralized debiasing, the signalling of the biasing
values has impact on RAN3 specifications. UE receiver capability may be
signalled.
For the support of E-DCH decoupling, RAN2/3 signalling needs to be specified.
For the support of DF-DC, it is expected that the impact is on RAN1/2
specifications to add the new configuration.
For the support of NAIC, new signalling is expected to be specified: physical
layer signalling and/or higher layer signalling (impact on RAN1/2/3
specifications). UE receiver capability may be signalled. New RAN4
requirements may be specified for the IC capable UE receiver.
For the support of combined cell, the physical channel structure for pilots
needs to be added in RAN1 specifications, along with the control/feedback
channels, and the associated higher layer signalling in RAN2/3 specifications.
# 9 Conclusion
Heterogeneous networks offer substantial throughput gains for HSPA. The gains
increase as the percentage of UE offloaded from Macro cell to LPN increases.
For co-channel deployment, when placing LPNs within the Macro area, the
average, median and edge throughputs increase significantly, and throughput
increases when increasing the number of LPNs per Macro area and/or increasing
the transmit power of the LPNs. UL/DL imbalance in HetNet create issues such
as HS-DPCCH reliability and uplink interference, limiting the downlink and
uplink throughputs. To increase throughput gains, more UEs can be offloaded
from Macro nodes to LPNs by applying the cell individual offset (CIO) to bias
towards the LPNs during serving cell selection.
On the downlink, with 4 37dBm LPNs and CIO=3dB, the gains are in the order of
250% and 100% for the average and 5% UE throughput, respectively, with
offloading percentage of about 50%. As an example for the uplink, when placing
4 37dBm LPNs per Macro area, around 40% of the UEs are offloaded to LPNs and
then above 250% average throughput can be achieved. Compared to a CIO of 0dB,
applying a moderate CIO of 3dB allows less UL/DL imbalance and more UEs can be
offloaded to LPNs, which in turn improves the performance gains. For further
details on the results, see subclause 7.1.7.
Further gains can be achieved when the CIO values are adapted based on the
cells' loading. An example of adapting the CIO values is to use the
decentralised biasing method as described in subclause 7.2.3. Other way to
achieve further gains is to implement methods which will allow minimizing
interferences from UEs not in Soft HO towards macro and LPN base stations
originating from the UL/DL imbalance situation. Those can be based on limiting
macro UL UE throughput, applying different values of CIO or receiver
sensitivity level in LPN, ICIC or changing the carrier frequency for terminals
located in Strong Mismatch Zone (SMZ). Further details can be found in
subclause 7.1.6.
The reliability of the control information in the downlink and uplink has been
investigated. Based on this study, it was found that s _ome problems may arise
when applying CIOs exceeding 6dB for single Rx antenna UEs and exceeding 9dB
for dual Rx antenna UEs._ To ensure HS-DPCCH reliability in the uplink,
several alternatives have been addressed, including boosting of HS-DPCCH or
changes in power control/SIR can be done in current networks, or a new uplink
pilot channel can be added.
SF-DC operation improves the system performance at medium to low loading,
especially for the cell edge users. As the CIO increases and the cell edge
burst rate becomes smaller, SF-DC can improve the performance in the range of
50% to 70% for the cell edge.
DF-DC operation improves the range expansion gain. Using 4 LPNs/Macro as an
example, compared to DC only operation with range expansion, for interference
limited scenario DF-DC operation increase the 5% UE throughput gain from
around 128% to 180% while keeping the mean and media UE throughput almost the
same. For noise limited scenario, the average UE throughput gain improves from
226% to 301% and the 5% UE throughput gain improves from 67% to 99%.
E-DCH decoupling was one of the solutions considered in order to reduce the
negative effect of DL/UL imbalance. From the system evaluation when DL control
signalling is assumed ideal and its power overhead not accounted for, EDCH
decoupling gains up to 12% respect to the baseline co-channel deployment can
be achieved depending on the scheduling algorithm. These gains are observed
for CIO values between 3dB and 6dB, for which both UL and DL throughputs are
maximized. For CIO values up to 6dB, in the downlink the F-DPCH transmitted by
the non-serving LPN is reliable and the same F-DPCH power as in baseline co-
channel deployment can be used in E-DCH decoupling. Extra signalling
information is needed to be exchanged between the network and the UE to
decouple the UL in case of the UE entering SHO area. E-DCH decoupling scheme
was identified as a method which solves the problem with reception of UL HSUPA
scheduling related information (happy-bit, Scheduling Information) by the
serving macro cell. However other schemes improving the Scheduling Information
reception reliability were also part of the study e.g. E-TFC selection back-
off for UL SI, Dynamic power boosting etc. More details regarding benefits and
drawbacks of all those methods can be found in clause 7.1.2 for legacy
terminals and in 7.1.3 for Rel-12 enhancements
For combined cell:
  * SFN mode is primarily used for legacy users. When the propagation delay offsets between different transmitting nodes are not accounted for, there is a gain of up to 30% seen for legacy users in link simulations and gains of around 6-17% in system simulations. However, when practical propagation offsets are considered, the gains are reduced. System level simulation results have shown a loss of around 5.7%, while link level simulation results show that the loss is around 6% for solution I and around 25% for solution II. This loss is observed in the Pedestrian A channel and is smaller for other multipath channels.
  * Both system level simulations and link level simulations have shown significant throughput gains with spatial reuse mode as compared to the macro only network. Compared to the co-channel deployment, there is an 8 -- 11%loss due to the additional pilot overhead in spatial reuse mode.
  * It has been shown that also legacy users can enjoy the benefits of Spatial Reuse (SR). From the simulation results, it is seen that enabling SR for legacy users has a good potential to increase capacity compared to SFN. However, to reach performance matching the co-channel case, new combined cell pilots are needed.
Network Assisted Interference Cancellation (NAIC) was studied and potential
benefits and techniques have been identified. Both pre-decoding and post-
decoding interference cancellation have been considered, and substantial gains
of post-decoding IC over Type 3i can be achieved based on link level
simulations. The link level simulation gains of pre-decoding over Type 3i
receiver are also promising. Further system level investigations are needed in
order to conclude on the benefits of NAIC.
For Restricted Resources Subframe (RRS) pattern NAIC technique, when
restricting the modulation or code set of the interferer on some pre-
configured subframes, UE throughput gains over a baseline without RRS pattern
have been shown in link level simulations. Further evaluation of the impact on
Macro capacity is needed.
Some of the solutions discussed in the Technical Report do not need standard
support.
For the mobility study, RAN2 concludes as follows:
  * For mass small cell deployment, any further focus should be on NCL extension
  * For speed based mobility, further enhancements can be considered
  * For small cell discovery and identification, any further focus should be on proximity detection (UE based, NW based, UE based NW assisted) and the relaxed inter-frequency measurements for UE in Non DCH state.
  * For combined cell, mobility benefits could be expected, and no RAN2 mobility impact has been identified.
  * For range expansion, further mobility enhancements (e.g., intra-frequency event triggered reporting on the secondary carrier) can be considered.

# A.2 System performance evaluation metrics
For bursty traffic, the following performance measures are used for
evaluation:
  * Average burst rate:
    * The burst rate is defined as the ratio between the data burst > size in bits and the total time the burst spent in the system.
    * The total time the burst spent in the system is the time > difference measured between the instant the data burst arrives > at the Node B and the instant when the transfer of the burst > over the air interface is completed.
    * The total time the burst spent in the system is equal to the sum > of the transmission time over the air and the queuing delay.
  * Total system throughput
  * UE throughput: average, 50%, and 5%
  * Percentage of UEs served by LPNs
  * PDF of RLC packet delay: the delay is calculated as the time between when the RLC packet is constructed at the RNC until it is delivered by UE RLC receiver to upper layers; RLC packets discarded after maximum number of retransmissions should be counted separately. This metric is only applicable for scenarios as MultiFlow, where the RLC may be modelled.
  * Average and CDF of RoT for UL
For full buffer traffic, the following performance measures are used for
evaluation:
  * Sector throughput
  * UE throughput: average, 50%, and 5%
  * Percentage of UEs served by LPNs
  * Average and CDF of RoT for UL

The metrics used to evaluate the HS-DPCCH are described as follows:
  * False alarm
    * This event occurs when the NodeB falsely detects data when the UE transmits only DTX.
  * Misdetection or decoding error
    * This event occurs when one of the following events occur
      * The NodeB does not detect data when the UE transmits data, OR
      * The NodeB correctly detects data but decodes it incorrectly.
The misdetection or decoding error metric is computed as follows:
where
> $C_{\text{MD}}$= number of active carriers
>
> $C_{\text{DE}}$= total number of streams that are in error.

# A.7 Mobility simulation performance metrics
  * For UEs, a handover failure is declared if
    * after event 1D is triggered for the target cell, UE fails to > receive the RBR from the source cell, or
    * after the event 1A or event 1C was triggered for the same target > cell, UE failed to receive the ASU that added the target cell > in the active set.
  * RRC message reception failure can be modelled by either one of the two methods:
    * actual decoding failure;
    * comparing the CPICH EcIo with the respective threshold for the > RRC message.
  * Ping-pong handoverï¼š
    * Period during UE hand-in a cell and hand-out this cell less than > define threshold (i.e. 1 second).
  * Ping-pong handover ratioï¼š
    * defined by (number of Ping-Pong HOs) / (Total number of HO > attempts- number of HO failures).
# A.8 Mobility simulation results
Based on the mobility simulation assumption and performance metrics defined
above, simulation has been conducted focusing on the following cases: active
set update failure, serving cell change failure and ping-pong handover,
detailed simulation results could be seen in [6][7][8].
# A.9 Observations from the mobility simulation results
From the simulation results, the following observations could be achieved:
  * With the deployment of small cells, especially with the number of deployed small cells within one Macro cell increasing, both active set update and serving cell change increase.
  * With the increase of LPN density and UE\'s moving speed, both active set update failure ratio and serving cell change failure ratio increase.
  * In general, higher failure ratio for active set update and serving cell change is observed for mobility between Macro cells and smalls than between Macro cells, especially for mobility from small cell to Macro cell.
  * When SRB over HSPA is configured with pre-Rel8 serving cell change, the handover failure ratio is observed to be higher than using SRB over DCH or Rel8 enhanced serving cell change (using SRB over HS).
  * eSCC (SRBoH) can also achieve much better HO (serving cell change) performance than SCC with SRBoH
SCC with SRBoD and eSCC (SRBoH) could achieve similar HO (serving cell change)
performance
