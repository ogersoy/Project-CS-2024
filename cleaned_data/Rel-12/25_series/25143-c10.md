# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and the
donor base station.
**Down-link:** signal path where base station transmits and mobile receives
**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.
**Operating band:** the frequency range in which UTRA FDD operates, that is
defined with a specific set of technical requirements.
NOTE 1: The operating band(s) for an UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 4.1, Table 4.1.
NOTE 2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating band
and downlink operating band.
**Pass band:** the pass band is the frequency range in which the Repeater
operates in with operational configuration. This frequency range can
correspond to one or several consecutive nominal 5 MHz channels. If they are
not consecutive each subset of channels shall be considered as an individual
pass band. A repeater can have one or several pass bands.
**Repeater:** a device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or
conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from the base station to
the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from the mobile to the base
station). In operating bands specified with only down-link or up-link, only
the up-link or down-link as specified for the operating band is repeated.
**Up-link:** signal path where mobile transmits and base station receives.

* * *
b) A UTRA/FDD Repeater can support both fixed and variable up-link to down-
link frequency separation.
c) The use of other up-link to down-link frequency separations in existing or
other frequency bands shall not be precluded.
## 4.3 Channel arrangement
### 4.3.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 4.3.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to the table 4.4, which
means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 4.3.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN).
For each operating band, the UARFCN values are defined as follows.
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ -- F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ -- F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 4.3 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and
F~DL~ are defined in Table 4.4.

# 5 General test conditions and declarations
This specification applies only to UTRA/FDD Repeater.
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification. Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter
relative to a value, that is not fully specified in the UTRA specifications.
For these tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal
value specified by the manufacturer.
Some requirements for the Repeater may be regional as listed in subclause 5.6.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
Schematic drawings for the individual measurement set-up can be found in the
Annex.
## 5.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance, and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF test it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 5.1 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
### 5.1.1 Measurements of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the Repeater test environments defined in
Subclause 5.4, Test environments shall be.
> Pressure: ± 5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ± 2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ± 5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ± 1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ± 1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

## 5.9 Repeater configurations
### 5.9.1 Power supply options
If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the
power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of
conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the
range of conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
### 5.9.2 Combining of Repeaters
If the repeater is intended for combination with additional apparatus
connected to a repeater port and this combination is supplied as a system, the
combination of repeater together with the additional apparatus shall also
fulfil the repeater requirements. E.g. if the repeater is intended for
combination such that multiple repeaters amplify the same signals into the
same ports the combination shall also fulfil the repeater requirements.
An example of such a configuration is shown in figure 5.1

available at the antenna connector.
## 6.1 Maximum output power
### 6.1.1 Definition and applicability
Maximum output power, Pmax, of the Repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference condition.

### 7.4.2 Procedure
Measure the frequency error for both paths uplink and downlink of the
Repeater.
## 7.5 Test requirements
The measurement result of 7.4.2 shall not exceed:
\| f ~IN~ -- f out \| ≤ (f out * 0,01 ppm) + 12 Hz
# 8 Out of band gain
## 8.1 Definitions and applicability
Out of band gain refers to the gain of the Repeater immediately outside the
pass band. The measurements shall apply to both paths uplink and downlink of
the Repeater.
## 8.2 Minimum Requirements
The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in band signals
and not to amplify the out of band emission of the donor base station.
In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is less than
the donor coupling loss.
The repeater minimum donor coupling loss shall be declared by the
manufacturer. This is this the minimum required attenuation between the donor
BS and the repeater for proper repeater operation.
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the gain outside the pass
band shall not exceed the maximum level specified in Table 8.1, where:
> \- f_offset is the distance from the centre frequency of the first or last 5
> MHz channel within the pass band.
Table 8.1: Out of band gain limits 1
* * *
Frequency offset from the carrier frequency, f_offset Maximum gain 2,7 ≤
f_offset \ 3,0GHz.
### 8.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Set the signal generator to generate a CW-signal, applied to the input port
of the Repeater. The power level of the RF input signal shall be at least 5 dB
below the power level which, when applied within the pass band, would produce
the maximum rated output power, as declared by the manufacturer. This is to
ensure that the equipment is operating in the linear output range.
3) The average output power in each case shall be measured using a spectrum
analyser connected to the output port of the Repeater and the net gain shall
be recorded compared to table 8.3 or table 8.4 whichever is lower.
4) With the same input power as in step 1) set the repeater gain to the
minimum specified by the manufacturer.
5) The average output power in each case shall be measured using a spectrum
analyser connected to the output port of the Repeater and the net gain shall
be recorded and compared to table 8.3 or table 8.4 whichever is lower.

> NOTE 2: The requirements shall be reconsidered when the state of the art
> technology progresses.
>
> NOTE 3: The protection of R-GSM is for further study.
### 9.1.4 Co-existence with services in adjacent frequency bands
This requirement may be applied for the protection in bands adjacent to bands
I or VII, as defined in clause 4.1 in geographic areas in which both an
adjacent band service and UTRA are deployed.
The requirement applies only to the down-link direction of the repeater.

## 9.2 Spurious emissions
### 9.2.1 Definition and applicability
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
This is measured at the Repeater output port.
The requirements of either subclause 9.2.2.1 or subclause 9.2.2.2 shall apply
whatever the type of Repeater considered (one or several pass bands). It
applies for all configurations foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.
The spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz (or above, as
indicated in Table 9.9 and 9.10), excluding the frequency range from 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of the repeaters operating band up to 10 MHz above
the highest frequency of the repeaters operating band. Exceptions are the
requirement in Table 9.17 and 9.21 that apply also closer than 10 MHz from
repeaters operating band.
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power (RMS).
For repeaters capable of supporting both UTRA and E-UTRA, conformance to the
UTRA spurious emission requirements can also be demonstrated using E-UTRA
spurious emission test methods as described in TS 36.143 [13].
### 9.2.2 Minimum Requirements
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the following requirements
shall be met.
#### 9.2.2.1 Spurious emission (Category A)
The following requirements shall be met in cases where Category A limits for
spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [4], are
applied.
At maximum Repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the Repeater,
at levels that produce the maximum rated output power per channel, the power
of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits specified in Table 9.9.
When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB the requirements shall
still be met.
The requirement shall apply both with or without an input signal applied.

spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [4], are
applied.
At maximum Repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the Repeater,
at levels that produce the maximum rated power output per channel, the power
of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits specified in Tables 9.10
and 9.10A depending on the declared operating band for the down- and up-link.

is defined. This test includes EVM and peak code domain error.
## 10.1 Error vector magnitude
In this section the procedure for testing the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of
Repeaters is defined.
### 10.1.1 Definition and applicability
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
theoretical waveform and a modified version of the measured waveform. The
modification is done according to annex E of TS25.141. This difference is
called the error vector. The EVM result is defined as the square root of the
ratio of the mean error vector power to the modified mean reference signal
power expressed as a %. The measurement interval is one power control group
(timeslot).

Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.
The test is based upon the test for the base station. Test model 1 as
described in TS25.141 is used for the definition of the signal to test on. A
signal generator providing the required signals is connected to the input of
the Repeater. The Repeater is set to operate at full gain. The signal level is
adjusted to the equivalent level to obtain the nominal output power as
declared by the manufacturer. A signal analyser connected to the output is
used to measure the EVM value.
#### 10.1.4.2 Procedure

Magnitude, as defined in TS25.106, shall not exceed 13,2%.
## 10.2 Peak code domain error
In this section the procedure for testing the Peak Code Domain Error of
Repeaters is defined.
### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector onto the
code domain at a specific spreading factor. The Code Domain Error for every
code in the domain is defined as the ratio of the mean power of the projection
onto that code, to the mean power of the composite reference waveform. This
ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak Code Domain Error is defined as the maximum
value for the Code Domain Error for all codes. The measurement interval is one
power control group (timeslot).

described in TS25.141 is used for the definition of the signal to test on. A
signal generator providing the required signals is connected to the input of
the Repeater. The spreading factor of the signal generator is set to 256. The
Repeater is set to operate at full gain. The signal level is adjusted to the
equivalent level to obtain the nominal output power as declared by the
manufacturer. A signal analyser connected to the output is used to measure the
peak code domain error value.
#### 10.2.4.2 Procedure

shall not exceed -33,9 dB at spreading factor 256 as defined in TS25.106.
## 10.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE) for 64QAM modulation
### 10.3.1 Definition and applicability
The Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector (as
defined in 10.1) onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. Only
the active code channels in the composite reference waveform are considered
for this requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for every active code is
defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error projection onto that code,
to the mean power of the active code in the composite reference waveform. This
ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement interval is one frame.
The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for Repeater
supporting 64QAM modulated codes.
See TS25.141 [11] Annex E for further details.
### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement

error shall not exceed -19.3 dB at spreading factor 16 as defined in TS25.106.
# 11 Input intermodulation
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.
## 11.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to maintain
the wanted frequency free of internally created interference.
The test requirements in Tables 11.2 may be applied for the protection of FDD
Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA FDD and/or UTRA
FDD BS are co-located with a UTRA FDD Repeater.
The additional test requirements in Tables 11.2AA may be applied for the
protection of FDD Repeater input when a UTRA TDD BS is co-located with a UTRA
FDD Repeater.
This test applies to uplink and downlink path of the Repeater.
## 11.2 Minimum Requirements

For the parameters specified in table 11.2A and table 11.2AAA, the power in
the pass band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level
obtained without interfering signals applied.
## 11.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified in TS 25.106,
subclause 11.1.
## 11.4 Method of test
### 11.4.1 Initial conditions
1) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.
2) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
3) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.
4) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the Repeater. Set the
resolution bandwidth to 1 MHz in the centre of the pass band. Set averaging to
1 second or more.
### 11.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the pass
band, so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned in the
centre of the pass band, according to subclause 11.2.
2) Take the measurement of the rise of the output signal.
3) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the Repeater.
## 11.5 Test requirements
### 11.5.1 Mandatory requirement
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the intermodulation
performance should be met when the following signals are applied to the
Repeater:
Table 11.3: Input intermodulation requirement
* * *
f_offset Interfering Signal Levels Type of signals Measurement bandwidth 3,5
MHz -40 dBm 2 CW carriers 1 MHz
* * *
For the parameters specified in table 11.3, the power in the pass band shall
not increase by more than 11,2 dB at the output of the Repeater as measured in
the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained without
interfering signals applied.
### 11.5.2 Co-location with BS in other systems
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the intermodulation
performance should be met when the following signals are applied to the
Repeater:

For the parameters specified in table 11.4A and table 11.4AAA, the power in
the pass band shall not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level
obtained without interfering signals applied.
# 12 Output intermodulation
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products signals created
by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the repeater via the output
port.
## 12.1 Definition and applicability
The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation products
when a WCDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the output port at
a level of 30 dB lower than that of the wanted signal. The frequency of the
interference signal shall be ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and ±15 MHz offset from the
wanted signal, but within the frequency band allocated for UTRA FDD downlink
as specified in subclause 4.1.
The requirement is applicable for downlink signals.
The normative reference for this requirement is in TS25.106 [12] section 12.
## 12.2 Minimum requirement
In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1, the output intermodulation
level shall not exceed the out of band emission or the spurious emission
requirements of section 9.1 and 9.2.
## 12.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict the
generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject signal on
the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal applied at the
repeater output port.
## 12.4 Method of test
### 12.4.1 Initial conditions
1) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.
2) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater for tests of
repeaters with a pass band corresponding to one 5 MHz channel. Connect a
signal generator to the circulator on the output port and make sure the signal
generator power is directed to the repeater output port.
3) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 2,515
MHz and 4,0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.
4) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 4,0
MHz and (∆fmax -- 500 kHz) shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth. The 1MHz
measurement bandwidth may be calculated by integrating multiple 50 kHz or
narrower filter measurements
> 5) Detection mode: True RMS.
### 12.4.2 Procedures
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (subject signal) to
generate a signal in accordance to test model 1, TS 25.141 subclause 6.1.1.1,
at the level which produce the manufacturer specified maximum output power at
maximum gain.
3) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model 1, TS 25.141 subclause
6.1.1.1, at the level producing signal power corresponding to 30 dB below the
manufacturer specified maximum output power at the repeater output port with
the specified frequency offset from the wanted signal.
4) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value. Measurements in the band of the interfering signal shall be
excluded. The measurements can be limited to the power of all third and fifth
order intermodulation products.
5) Repeat from clause 3 until interference signals ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and ±15 MHz
frequency offset from the wanted signal has been tested. Note that interfering
signals outside the UTRA-FDD allocated frequency band , as specifies in
section 4.1. need not be tested.
## 12.5 Test requirements
In all measurements, the requirements according to sections 9.1.1.5 and the
downlink requirements in section 9.2.2.1 or 9.2.2.2 shall be fulfilled.
# 13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
## 13.1 Definitions and applicability
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted gain
per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the
repeater on an adjacent channel.
The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of Repeater where the
donor link is maintained via antennas (over the air Repeater).
## 13.2 Minimum Requirements
In normal conditions the ACRR shall be higher than the value specified in the
Table 13.1.

### 13.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the signal generator to transmit a signal modulated with a combination
of PCCPCH, SCCPCH and Dedicated Physical Channels specified as test model 1 in
TS 25.141 at the first or last 5 MHz channel within the pass band.
2) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain
3) Measure the RRC filtered mean power at the RF output port over a certain
slot.
4) Set the signal generator to transmit the same signal and the same input
power at one of the channel offsets according to Table 13.1.
5) Measure the RRC filtered mean power at the RF output port over a certain
slot.
6) Calculate the ratio of the measured power in the pass band to the measured
power at the channel offset.
7) Repeat step 4) to 6) until all channel offsets in Table 13.1 are measured.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements
The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined in subclause 5.2. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test
Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum
Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in table B.1.
