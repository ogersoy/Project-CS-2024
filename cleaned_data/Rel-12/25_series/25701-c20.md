# 4 Scenarios of scalable UMTS
## 4.1 Description
In standalone scenario, scalable UMTS carrier can be supported as standalone
utilization.
The multi-carrier scenario refers to the mode of operation where the 5 MHz
carrier acts as the primary carrier, and the scalable UMTS carrier is usable
as the secondary HS-DSCH carrier in downlink.
## 4.2 Deployment scenarios
Tables 4.2-1 and 4.2-2 below are listing the scenarios of scalable UMTS.

## 4.3 Feature support in UMTS and scalable UMTS
Potentially, the feature set supported by UMTS and scalable UMTS may differ.
Some initial observations have been made, but the following aspects have not
been considered in any detail by RAN1:
\- The degree to which scalable UMTS and UMTS features should be tied
Future standardization of new features for UMTS may potentially become more
complicated if scalable UMTS is introduced. For example, for each new UMTS
feature, an evaluation of the benefit of including the feature into scalable
UMTS would need to be evaluated. It should be clear from the initiation of a
scalable UMTS RAT whether new features should be always applicable to both.
An alternative would be to decouple scalable UMTS from UMTS and see it as a
separate RAT with more limited capabilities and its own evolution roadmap.
Specifying different capability levels for UMTS and scalable UMTS should be
seen in the light of the overall evolution roadmap.
\- How capability signaling should be managed, considering signaling and test
overhead
Another consideration should be whether UE capability for optional features
should be tied between UMTS and scalable UMTS, or whether capability should be
signaled separately. Introducing a new separate set of capabilities for the
scalable UMTS carrier could lead to increased signaling, and an explosion of
capability combinations that need to be tested, and will cause complications
in the RNC's radio resource management algorithms. On the other hand, tying
capabilities would require consideration of the benefits of features for both
scalable UMTS and UMTS.
\- Impacts on the overall benefit of scalable UMTS and carrier management of
not supporting all UMTS features
The performance of time dilated UMTS and scalable UMTS by filtering has been
evaluated against UMTS considering a release 6 configuration (i.e. no MIMO, no
advanced receivers, no multiflow etc.). The evolution of UMTS has aimed to
provide increased performance. Thus, against a benchmark of release 12 UMTS,
the performance of scalable UMTS will be further reduced. This highlights the
questions further as to whether scalable UMTS should support release 12
features, what the relative benefits of the features look like, and whether if
release 12 features are not supported the intention should be to evolve
scalable UMTS or that it always remains a low capability feature.
\- Specification complexity and management
Differing support between UMTS and scalable UMTS for different features would
potentially impact the complexity and diversity of the specifications. If the
reduced bandwidth UMTS would be specified within the existing specification
series, then the modes of operation and applicability of different features
would need to be differentiated. An alternative would be specifying reduced
bandwidth UMTS in separate specifications, however this would increase
overhead for specification maintenance.
# 5 Evaluation methodology
## 5.1 Channel model
The chip rate of time-dilated UMTS could be reduced to ½ or ¼ from the
existing 3.84 Mcps operation.\ Typically, in a UMTS link simulator, the
wireless multipath resolution is in units of the over sampling frequency K/Tc
at the output of the transmitter filter where Tc = 1 UMTS chip and K is the
oversampling factor.\ This is shown in Figure 5.1-1.
Figure 5.1-1: Sampling frequency at Tx filter output in UMTS
Channel multipath resolution should be invariant in different time-dilated
UMTS bandwidths, which could be realized by using the same channel sampling
rate as in the legacy UMTS system. Via this way, the existing PA, PB and VA
channel designed for legacy UMTS evaluation can be reused for time-dilated
UMTS.
For example, when K=4, the oversampling frequency is 15.36MHz in legacy UMTS
system. If it maintains the same multipath resolution, the time-dilated UMTS
oversampling frequency will be (K*N)/ Tc` = (K*N) / N*Tc = K / Tc. Therefore,
the oversampling in time-dilated UMTS is also 15.36MHz. This is illustrated in
Figure 5.1-2.

maintain the same multipath resolution as in UMTS
## 5.2 Link-level simulation
Link-level simulation assumptions and performance metrics for time-dilated
UMTS are defined in this subclause, for both the DownLink (DL) and UpLink
(UL). Specifically, the standalone DL, standalone UL and Carrier Aggregation
(CA) DL cases are covered. It should be noted that time-dilating control
channels is a method for trading off overhead to latency.
### 5.2.1 Simulation assumptions

The baseline parameters to be used for link-level simulations of standalone
time-dilated UMTS DL are listed in Table 5.2.1.1-1. For all DL link-level
assumptions, residual frequency error shall be 0 ppm.

### 5.2.2 Performance evaluation metrics
For DCH voice traffic, the following metric should be considered:
\- DL
\- BLER v/s Ec/Ior
\- UL
\- Residual BLER v/s Transmitted Ec/No.
\- Residual BLER v/s Received Ec/N0.
For HSPA traffic, the following metrics should be considered:
\- Throughput.
\- For latency:
\- Compute transmission delay CDF for L1 delay.
\- CELL_DCH latency
\- Compare the CDFs of the average number of the transmissions and then take
into account the increase in the TTI lengths to evaluate the latency.
\- Access latency
\- Consider with and without additional power/overhead.
\- For coverage:
\- CELL_DCH coverage
\- Examine performance at different geometries.
\- Access coverage
\- Consider with and without additional power/overhead.
Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) should be taken into account. The ICI model
is described in R1-131588 [9].\ The interference rise metric should be
considered.
In time-dilated UMTS link-level simulation, the performance metrics shall be
carrier specific.

### 5.3.2 Performance evaluation metrics
The following performance metrics should be compared between UMTS and scalable
UMTS.
For bursty traffic, the following performance measures are used for
evaluation:
\- Average burst rate:
\- The burst rate is defined as the ratio between the data burst size in bits
and the total time the burst spent in the system.
\- The total time the burst spent in the system is the time difference
measured between the instant the data burst arrives at the Node B and the
instant when the transfer of the burst over the air interface is completed.
\- The total time the burst spent in the system is equal to the sum of the
transmission time over the air and the queuing delay.
\- Total system throughput
\- UE throughput: average, 50%, and 5%
\- PDF of RLC packet delay: the delay is calculated as the time between when
the RLC packet is constructed at the RNC until it is delivered by UE RLC
receiver to upper layers; RLC packets discarded after maximum number of
retransmissions should be counted separately.
\- Average and CDF of RoT for UL
For full buffer traffic, the following performance measures are used for
evaluation:
\- Sector throughput
\- UE throughput: average, 50%, and 5%
\- Average and CDF of RoT for UL
The neighbour cell activity level should be modelled realistically considering
the offered load level and link throughput.
The full buffer results are indicative of the relative spectral efficiencies
that can be achieved with time-dilated UMTS, and are a complement to link
level simulations. However, they do not capture key system level aspects load
variation, activity factor, scheduling impact, queuing delay etc.
The bursty traffic results are a better indicator of the overall performance
of time-dilated UMTS since they take into account the differences in activity
factors, neighbour cell loading and inter-cell interference in a more
realistic manner. Therefore, conclusions on the relative performance of time-
dilated UMTS are primarily based on the bursty traffic analysis.
# 6 Solutions of scalable UMTS
## 6.1 Time dilation solution for scalable UMTS
### 6.1.1 Description
The scalable UMTS time dilation solution comprises increasing the UMTS chip
period by a time dilation factor N, where N is equal to 2 or 4. Consequently,
the scalable UMTS chip period is increased to N*T~c~, where T~c~ is the UMTS
chip period (i.e., 0.26 μs). This results in the scalable UMTS chip rate being
reduced by a factor of 1/N relative to the UMTS chip rate of 3.84 Mcps and the
scalable UMTS spectrum bandwidth being reduced by a factor of 1/N relative to
the UMTS spectrum bandwidth of 5 MHz. For example, in a 2.5 MHz bandwidth
(referred to as time-dilated UMTS N=2), the chip rate is reduced by a factor
of 2 relative to UMTS to 1.92 Mcps. In this sense, time dilation is used as a
means of achieving a smaller spectrum bandwidth. In the present document, this
solution is referred to as time-dilated UMTS. Figure 6.1.1-1 illustrates the
time dilation concept.
Figure 6.1.1-1: time-dilated UMTS FDD waveform
Time-dilated UMTS reuses the UMTS FDD physical layer specifications to as
large extent as possible. However, due to time dilation, all time-related
physical layer parameters in time-dilated UMTS are scaled accordingly (i.e.,
dilated N times relative to UMTS). For example, in the case of time-dilated
UMTS N=2, the radio frame duration increases from 10 ms to 20 ms which is
illustrated in Figure 6.1.1-2. Also, the HS-PDSCH subframe duration increases
from 2 ms to 4 ms as shown in Figure 6.1.1-3.

solution
#### 6.1.1.1 Power Spectral Density (PSD) of scalable UMTS Systems
In this subclause, different options for power spectral density are discussed
for standalone and dual carrier time-dilated UMTS systems. Since the bandwidth
of the time-dilated UMTS waveform is reduced, the PSD of time-dilated UMTS
system can be increased so that the total power of the time-dilated UMTS
system is the same as the total power of the equivalent UMTS system. On the
other hand, the PSD of the time-dilated UMTS system may also be increased to
be comparable with the UMTS system. These options are reviewed in this
subclause.
##### 6.1.1.1.1 Standalone time-dilated UMTS in downlink
Figure 6.1.1.1.1-**1** shows the scalable UMTS system based on the time
dilation solution, with the same PSD as normal UMTS system. In this scenario,
time-dilated UMTS system NodeB power is smaller than the UMTS system.\ In this
case, the power of time-dilated UMTS system with N = 2 is half, and in N = 4,
the power is one-fourth of the total power of the equivalent normal UMTS
system. This is illustrated in Figure 6.1.1.1.1-**1**. For example, for the
uplink, if the normal UMTS UE transmit power is 23 dBm, then the time-dilated
UMTS UE transmit power is 23 dBm -- 10log~10~(N) (i.e., 20 dBm for time-
dilated UMTS N=2 and 17 dBm for time-dilated UMTS N=4). In the downlink, if
the normal UMTS Node B/cell transmit power is 43 dBm, then the time-dilated
UMTS Node B/cell transmit power is 43 dBm - 10log~10~(N) (i.e., 40 dBm for
time-dilated UMTS N=2 and 37 dBm for time-dilated UMTS N=4).
Figure 6.1.1.1.1-1: Scalable UMTS N=2 time-dilation solution, with the same
PSD.\ The same principle applies to N = 4
Figure 6.1.1.1.1-**2** shows the scalable UMTS system based on the time-
dilation solution, with higher PSD.\ In this scenario, time-dilated UMTS
system has the same power as compared with the UMTS system.\ The PSD of time-
dilated UMTS system with N = 2 is twice, and in case of N = 4, is four times
the PSD of equivalent UMTS system, giving the time-dilated UMTS the same power
as the equivalent UMTS system.\ For example, in DL, if the normal UMTS Node
B/cell transmit power is 43 dBm, then the time-dilated UMTS Node B/cell
transmit power is also 43 dBm (for both time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4). In UL,
if the normal UMTS UE transmit power is 23dBm, then the time-dilated UMTS UE
transmit power is also 23dBm (for both N =2 and N = 4).

UMTS\ (i.e. time-dilated UMTS transmit power same as normal UMTS)
##### 6.1.1.1.2 Multi-carrier time-dilated UMTS in DL
The PSD level of dual carried Scalable UMTS depends on whether additional
power is available for the time-dilated UMTS carrier, or the total power is
shared between legacy UMTS and time-dilated UMTS systems.
In Table 6.1.1.1.2-1, a summary of possible scenarios for multi-carrier UMTS
system is considered.\ Extra NodeB power may be dedicated to the time-dilated
UMTS carrier, with higher PSD or the same PSD level.\ Alternatively, time-
dilated UMTS and legacy UMTS may share the total NodeB power. These options
are summarized in Table 6.1.1.1.2-1, and further explained in this subclause.
Table 6.1.1.1.2-1: Scenarios for multi-carrier time-dilated UMTS system

Total NodeB Power time-dilated UMTS vs. UMTS Carrier PSD Note Extra Power for
time-dilated UMTS Carrier Same PSD between time-dilated UMTS and Legacy UMTS
e.g., separate PA, without increasing time-dilated UMTS PSD Shared Power
between time-dilated and Legacy UMTS Carrier Same PSD between time-dilated
UMTS and Legacy UMTS e.g., single PA, reducing PSD of both UMTS and time-
dilated UMTS Extra Power for time-dilated UMTS Carrier Higher PSD for time-
dilated UMTS as compared to Legacy UMTS Carrier e.g., separate PA, with
increasing time-dilated UMTS PSD
* * *
Figure 6.1.1.1.2-1 represents the PSD of a dual carrier time-dilated UMTS
system with increased total power, and same PSD for time-dilated UMTS carrier.
In this case, the PSD of the time-dilated UMTS system is at the same level of
the PSD of the UMTS system. The overall power of the combined system is
increased, with extra power dedicated for the time-dilated UMTS carrier.

Figure 6.1.1.1.2-2 represents the PSD of a multi- carrier time-dilated UMTS
system in case of shared power between normal UMTS and time-dilated UMTS
carriers. The total NodeB power remains unchanged in this scenario, while PSD
of both normal UMTS and time-dilated UMTS is reduced. This scenario can be
attractive for example, if there is not additional NodeB power available for
time-dilated UMTS carrier.

total power as the UMTS carrier. The overall NodeB across carriers is
increased.

#### 6.1.1.2 Design options for PCCPCH channel
In this subclause, several design options are reviewed for the PCCPCH channel
with the time dilation solution.\ Two approaches are discussed, based on
reduction of the spreading factor, or addition of secondary PCCPCH channels.
##### 6.1.1.2.1 Single PCCPCH channel with reduced spreading factor
In this approach, the spreading factor of the PCCPCH is channel is scaled down
by a factor of N, N = 2 or 4. In conjunction of reduction of spreading factor,
the power allocated to the PCCPCH channel is scaled up by a factor of N.
##### 6.1.1.2.2 Multiple PCCPCH channels
In this approach, multiple PCCPCH channels are provision in N = 2 or N = 4
scenarios. These secondary PCCPCH channels use the same spreading factor and
power as standard PCCPCH channel in normal UMTS system. Two cases of N = 2 and
N = 4 are discussed in this subclause.
##### 6.1.1.2.2.1 Time-dilated UMTS N=2 {#time-dilated-umts-n2 .H6}
For time-dilated UMTS N=2, the multiple PCCPCH mechanism consists of using a
total of two SF=256 PCCPCHs in order to support the same BCH user data rate as
normal UMTS (i.e., 12.3 kbps). Since two SF=256 PCCPCHs are required, 3 dB
more power must be allocated to the time-dilated UMTS N=2 broadcast channel.
As an alternative to two SF=256 PCCPCHs, a single SF=128 PCCPCH could be used.
Table 6.1.1.2.2.1-1 lists the time-dilated UMTS N=2 time dilation solution BCH
parameters if two SF=256 PCCPCHs are used.

##### 6.1.1.2.2.2 Time-dilated UMTS N=4 {#time-dilated-umts-n4 .H6}
For time-dilated UMTS N=4, the multiple PCCPCH mechanism consists of using a
total of four SF=256 PCCPCHs in order to support the same BCH user data rate
as normal UMTS (i.e., 12.3 kbps). Since four SF=256 PCCPCHs are required, 6 dB
more power must be allocated to the time-dilated UMTS N=4 broadcast channel.
As an alternative to four SF=256 PCCPCHs, a single SF=64 PCCPCH could be used.
Table 6.1.1.2.2.2-1 lists the time-dilated UMTS N=4 time dilation solution BCH
parameters if four SF=256 PCCPCHs are used.

#### 6.1.1.3 CS voice in time-dilated UMTS
Since the spreading factor is maintained on all of the channelization codes,
the data rates are also reduced by a factor of 1/N for time-dilated UMTS.
However, for time-dilated UMTS N=2, for delay sensitive radio bearers such as
the standalone 3.4 kbps signalling radio bearers on DCH, the same bit-rate as
UMTS should be maintained.
In UMTS, a voice packet is produced every 20 ms from the vocoder and is
transmitted with a 20 ms TTI over the air interface. Together with the voice
packet, the SRB packet could also be transmitted over the air interface but
with a different TTI e.g. 40 ms TTI, as illustrated in Figure 6.1.1.3-1.
Figure 6.1.1.3-1: CS voice in UMTS
With the introduction of time-dilated UMTS, it is expected that the vocoder
function is to be kept unchanged.\ The voice packet should be transmitted over
the air interface with the same TTI as in UMTS i.e. 20 ms. Since with time-
dilated UMTS _N_ =2, the radio frame is 20 ms, the voice packet transmission
in stand-alone time-dilated UMTS can be re-designed as follows.
**Option 1: DPCH SF unchanged**.\ The same DPCH spreading factor as in the
legacy system is used. To maintain the same voice quality, multiple codes for
DPCH are to be used for one user. It is shown in Figure 6.1.1.3-2. Two DPCHs
per user are allocated for voice packet transmission. The SRB is transmitted
in both the DPCHs with TTI being kept unchanged i.e. 40 ms as in the legacy
system.
**Option 2: DPCH SF reduced**.\ The DPCH spreading factor is half of that used
in the legacy system, as illustrated in Figure 6.1.1.3-3. One DPCH per user is
allocated for voice packet transmission, with reduced SF compared with UMTS,
e.g. SF=64 in downlink in time-dilated UMTS N=2.
Figure 6.1.1.3-2: CS voice in stand-alone time-dilated UMTS option 1: DPCH SF
unchanged,\ SRB TTI = 40 ms
Figure 6.1.1.3-3: CS voice in stand-alone time-dilated UMTS option 2: DPCH SF
reduced,\ SRB TTI = 40 ms
Standalone time-dilated UMTS with N=2 supports CS voice over DCH using either
of the two options above.\ However, the voice capacity of time-dilated UMTS is
expected to be reduced when compared with UMTS.
#### 6.1.1.4 PRACH and AICH
The PRACH is used to carry the RACH. The AICH is used to carry the Acquisition
Indicator (AI).
##### 6.1.1.4.1 PRACH/AICH timing relation
Figure 6.1.1.4.1-1 illustrates the timing relationship between the AICH and
PRACH access slots for UMTS (i.e., N=1) and time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4. The
preamble-to-AI distance τ~p-a~ is defined in Table 6.1.1.4.2-1 of this
contribution. As depicted in figure 6.1.1.4.1-1, the PRACH and AICH access
slot lengths for time-dilated UMTS N=2 are increased from 1.33 ms to 2.67 ms
relative to UMTS. For time-dilated UMTS N=4, they are increased from 1.33 ms
to 5.33 ms relative to UMTS. Also, the radio frame length for time-dilated
UMTS N=2 is increased from 10 ms to 20 ms relative to UMTS while for time-
dilated UMTS N=4 it is increased from 10 ms to 40 ms relative to UMTS.

UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4
##### 6.1.1.4.2 Random access procedure
Figure 6.1.1.4.2-1 illustrates the UMTS (i.e. N=1) and time-dilated UMTS N=2
and N=4 random-access procedure. The preamble-to-preamble distance τ~p-p~,
preamble-to-AI distance τ~p-a~ and preamble-to-message distance τ~p-m~ are
defined in Table 6.1.1.4.2-1. As shown in Table 6.1.1.4.2-1, τ~p-p~, τ~p-a~
and τ~p-m~ for time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4 are increased by a factor of N
(i.e., 2 and 4) relative to UMTS. Also, the PRACH message part radio frame for
time-dilated UMTS N=2 is increased from 10 ms to 20 ms relative to UMTS while
for time-dilated UMTS N=4 it is increased from 10 ms to 40 ms relative to
UMTS.

##### 6.1.1.4.3 Random access procedure
Figure 6.1.1.4.3-1 illustrates the structure of the PRACH message part radio
frame for UMTS (i.e. N=1) and time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4. The N*10 ms
message part radio frame is split into 15 slots, each of length T~slot~ = 2560
chips. Each slot consists of two parts, a data part to which the RACH
transport channel is mapped and a control part that carries Layer 1 control
information. The data and control parts are transmitted in parallel. An N*10
ms message part consists of one message part radio frame, while an N*20 ms
message part consists of two consecutive N*10 ms message part radio frames.
The message part length is equal to the TTI of the RACH transport channel in
use.\ This TTI length is configured by higher layers (e.g., in SIB5).
NOTE: During the RRC connection establishment procedure, the PRACH message
part carries the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message.
As depicted in Figure 6.1.1.4.3-1, the PRACH message part radio frame for
time-dilated UMTS N=2 is increased from 10 ms to 20 ms relative to UMTS while
for time-dilated UMTS N=4 it is increased from 10 ms to 40 ms relative to
UMTS.
Figure 6.1.1.4.3-1: UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4 PRACH\ message part

Table 6.1.1.4.3-1 lists the random-access message data fields and Table
6.1.1.4.3-2 lists the random-access control fields for UMTS (i.e., N=1) and
time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4. Note that the channel bit rate and symbol rate
are reduced by a factor of 1/2 for time-dilated UMTS N=2 relative to UMTS. For
time-dilated UMTS N=4, they are reduced by a factor of 1/4 relative to UMTS.
Consequently, the SF for all slot formats stays the same.

##### 6.1.2.1.1 HSDPA simulations results
Tables 6.1.2.1.1-1 and 6.1.2.1.1-2 show the DL link level simulation results
for HSPA, comparing UMTS and time-dilated UMTS with scaling factor N =2, for
PA3, VA3, VA30 and VA120 channels, assuming one P-CCPCH channel. For outer-
loop ON, HARQ BLER control steers the BLER to a 10% target for the first HARQ
transmission.\ Table 6.1.2.1.1-1 and Table 6.1.2.1.1-2 correspond to the
results assuming outer loop ON and outer loop OFF, respectively. Due to the
variable implementation of outer loop by different network vendors, for
completeness, the outer loop OFF results are also included along with outer
loop ON results.
The performance metrics that are shown are computed as follows:

HSDPA latency as an additional metric for time-dilated UMTS (N=2, 4) for outer
loop ON setting is presented.\ The latency presented is the OTA transmission
delay taken to transmit a data packet. The following two figures depict the
CDF and average transmission delay metrics for UMTS and the time-dilated UMTS
for the same PSD and single PCCPCH code assumption.

Figure 6.1.2.1.1-2: Average transmission delay for time-dilated UMTS compared
to UMTS
The latency of DL control channels has increased due to time dilation -- by a
factor of 2 for N=2 time-dilated UMTS and by a factor of 4 for N=4 time-
dilated UMTS. The increase in latency allows the DL control channels to be
transmitted at the same transmit Ec/Ior as UMTS.
If the latency for the DL control channels in time dilation UMTS were to be
the same as UMTS, then the transmit Ec/Ior would have to increase by a factor
of 10logN.

#### 6.1.2.2 DCH link level simulation results
Time-dilated UMTS with scaling factor N = 2 is considered to be able to carry
AMR 12.2kbps DCH voice. In order to compare the performance of time-dilated
UMTS with UMTS, the following performance metrics are computed as:
_\- time-dilated UMTS gain (UL) = (Rx Ec/No with UMTS) -- (Rx Ec/No with time-
dilated UMTS -3dB)_
_\- time-dilated UMTS gain (DL) = (Tx Ec/Ior with UMTS) -- (Tx Ec/Ior with
time-dilated UMTS -3dB)_

#### 6.1.2.3 System level simulation results
In the standalone case, if an operator has a 5MHz UMTS carrier available that
is not fully loaded, it is always better to map users to the 5 MHz carrier,
since the users will experience significantly better throughput on 5 MHz than
2.5 MHz. Thus the metric of interest is the capacity available from a
standalone time-dilated UMTS carrier when other UMTS carriers are loaded or no
other carriers are available.
##### 6.1.2.3.1 Downlink bursty UEs simulation results in Band VIII
Average, 90^th^ and 5^th^ percentile burst rate of bursty traffic UEs is used
as the performance measure for the scenarios simulated. Burst rate is defined
as the ratio between the data burst size in bits and the total time the burst
spent in the system. Two evaluations of user burst rate and capacity in band
VIII have been performed and are presented in this subclause.
Figures 6.1.2.3.1-1\~3 show the bursty traffic performance of UMTS and time-
dilated UMTS for different user percentiles from evaluation 1.

Figure 6.1.2.3.1-3: Average UE burst rates for 90th percentile
The x-axis for Figures 6.1.2.3.1-1\~3 indicates the offered load per cell. The
number of users for any point can be obtained by dividing the offered load by
the average file size introduced in accordance with the bursty traffic model.
The performance of UMTS and time-dilated UMTS can be compared by examining the
performance of the two systems at the same relative load. Since time-dilated
UMTS N=2 (shown in the plots above) has half the bandwidth of UMTS, the load
for the two systems is equal when the number of users for time-dilated UMTS is
half that for UMTS. In other words, the average burst rate is compared when
the offered load for time-dilated UMTS is half that of UMTS,
When handling packet data in general, system level investigations in the
downlink indicate that user packet throughput will reduce to be lower than
1/N. This implies that packet transfer times increase by at least N, and in
most cases greater than N when comparing time-dilated UMTS and UMTS. This will
increase in general the activity level of the cell. (For small packets that
can be transferred in less than 1 TTI and voice packets, transfer time will
increase by N.)
In another evaluation (evaluation 2), the average UE burst rate for UMTS and
time-dilated UMTS is shown in Figure 6.1.2.3.1-4. In addition the performance
for multiple P-CCPCHs is also shown for N=2 and N=4 time-dilated UMTS.

Figures 6.1.2.3.1-5\~7 show the performance of time-dilated UMTS with
normalized offered load for evaluation 1.\ A comparison of the performance at
the same relative load per carrier can be made from these figures.

Figure 6.1.2.3.1-7: 90th percentile user throughput vs. offered load
It is observed that if there would be no spectral efficiency loss at link
level, the average burst rate of UMTS system would be approximately twice that
of Time dilated UMTS system with N =2 when the load per MHz is the same (i.e.
the there is half as much traffic on 2.5 MHz compared with 5 MHz). Also, the
average burst rate of UMTS would be approximately 4 times the average burst
rate of Time dilated UMTS with N = 4 when the load per MHz is the same (i.e.
one quarter of the traffic volume of 5 MHz). This is expected as the loading
is the same in a UMTS system with m UEs and m/N UEs for Time dilated UMTS
system with dilation factor N. The reduction in the bandwidth accounts for the
reduced burst rate.
It can also be observed that while the burst rate for time-dilated UMTS N=2 is
expected to be half of UMTS, when practical link losses are accounted for, it
is somewhat less than half of UMTS due to link level losses, the lower
trunking efficiency in time-dilated UMTS and the increased inter-cell
interference.
Table 6.1.2.3.1-1 shows the 50^th^ and 5^th^ percentile user burst rates that
can be achieved with a 5 MHz UMTS carrier and with a 2.5 MHz UMTS carrier at
several normalized offered load levels, derived from figures 6.1.2.3.1-5 to
6.1.2.3.1-7.

The CDF of burst rate for different number of UEs for time-dilated UMTS and
UMTS for evaluation 2 is plotted in Figure 6.1.2.3.1-8. This corresponds to 8
UEs for UMTS and 4 and 2 for time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4.
From Figure 6.1.2.3.1-8, it is observed that the effect of the additional
P-CCPCH and consequently the increased Ec/Ior is approximately a constant
change in the burst rate over different number of UEs. For N =2 Time dilated
UMTS system, the burst rate is about 300 kbps more when a single P-CCPCH is
configured compared to when two\ P-PCCPCHs are configured. For time-dilated
UMTS N =4, the burst rate is about 500 kbps more when a single P-CCPCH is
configured.

### 6.1.3 Coverage of time-dilated UMTS
The coverage of time-dilated UMTS is analyzed by computing the link budget of
time-dilated UMTS N=2 and with that of UMTS (N=1). The evaluation is done for
both 2 ms and 10 ms TTI lengths and for the cases where the power spectral
densities are set to be the same for both UMTS and time-dilated UMTS and where
the power levels are set to be the same.
The comparison is made for R99 voice as well as E-DCH traffic. In the case of
E-DCH traffic, the TBS size for time-dilated UMTS is set to be twice that of
UMTS. The T/P is chosen such that the data rates of UMTS and time-dilated UMTS
are the same for fair comparison of coverage.
Simulations were performed to evaluate the required Eb/No per antenna to
complete the link. Since the link budget evaluates the MAPL (Maximum Allowed
Path Loss), the UE is assumed to have reached it max power limit and so power
control is disabled. The most challenging channel from a coverage perspective
is the PA3 channel and so, the simulations assumed this channel. The
assumptions made for computing the link budget are shown in Table 6.1.3-1.

#### 6.1.3.1 Simulation results
Figures 6.1.3.1-1\~6.1.3.1-3 show the performance of UMTS and time-dilated
UMTS N=2 in the PA3 channel for 2 ms and 10 ms TTIs. The power control is
turned off and hence the performance corresponds to the worst case scenario
for purposes of coverage or link budget analysis.

Figure 6.1.3.1-3: BLER vs. combined Ec/No for UMTS and\ time-dilated UMTS with
N=2; AMR 12.2K; 900 MHz
From Figures 6.1.3.1-1 and 6.1.3.1-2, it can be seen that since the bandwidth
of time-dilated UMTS N=2 is half that of UMTS, the noise power is reduced by
half as well. Therefore, we would expect that the difference between the two
curves would be 3dB. However, note that the TBS size is doubled and the
resolution of the channel paths is lower in time-dilated UMTS resulting in the
allocation of a smaller number of fingers. Therefore, there is a reduction in
gains and we have a small loss in performance for time-dilated UMTS.
From Figure 6.1.3.1-3, it is seen that time-dilated UMTS requires around 3-4dB
additional SNR to achieve the same rate and latency for AMR12.2K. This is
expected since the spreading factor is reduced by half.
The target Ec/No is obtained from these curves in order to achieve a
performance of 1% BLER. This value is used to compute the corresponding link
budget and the results are presented in the next subclause.
#### 6.1.3.2 Link budget analysis
Link budget is analysed for UMTS and time-dilated UMTS for the following
cases:
\- R99 Full Rate AMR 12.2k
\- E-DCH with 2 ms and 10 ms TTI for UMTS
\- Corresponds to 4 ms and 20 ms TTIs for time-dilated UMTS N=2
\- Same PSD for both UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2
\- Same power levels for both UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2
\- Corresponds to different PSDs for UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2
\- The effective data rate is the same for both UMTS and time-dilated UMTS
Table 6.1.3.2-1 shows the link budget comparison between UMTS and time-dilated
UMTS N=2 for E-DCH data at the same data rates for 2 ms TTI.
Table 6.1.3.2-2 shows the link budget comparison between UMTS and time-dilated
UMTS N=2 for E-DCH data at the same data rates for 10 ms TTI.
Table 6.1.3.2-3 shows the link budget comparison between UMTS and time-dilated
UMTS N=2 for AMR 12.2K at the same latency.
Table 6.1.3.2-4 summarizes the MAPL values for all the link budget comparisons
between UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2.

* * *
From Tables 6.1.3.2-1\~6.1.3.2-4, the following observations can be made:
\- For E-DCH traffic,
\- When the same PSD is assumed, then the coverage in terms of MAPL between
UMTS and time-dilated UMTS is comparable. Even though the UE transmit power is
reduced by 3 dB, the corresponding reduction in noise power compensates
thereby resulting in similar coverage for both cases.
\- When the same power is assumed, there is a gain in coverage for time-
dilated UMTS by about 3dB. This is because the noise power level is reduced by
3 dB due to the reduction in the bandwidth but there is no corresponding
reduction in the transmit power. Note that the PSD in this case is not equal.
\- For AMR 12.2K
\- When same PSD is assumed, the coverage of time-dilated UMTS is lesser than
that of UMTS by around 4 dB. When the same power is assumed, the coverage is
lesser by 1 dB. These results imply that the time-dilated UMTS system should
be operated with the same power on the uplink.
### 6.1.4 Impacts on the network and UE
#### 6.1.4.1 UE receiver
Scenarios for time-dilated UMTS are divided to two cases, standalone and
multicarrier operation. It is justifiable to assume that time-dilated UMTS UE
would need to support also legacy UMTS. The complexity aspects discussed in
the following subclauses apply when UE is operating in the time-dilated UMTS
mode. The UE still needs to be dimensioned to support also legacy UMTS
operation.
The simulated time-dilated UMTS system in the present document assumed the
same sampling rate as the UMTS system. This complexity analysis is based on
scaled-down sampling rate, which is considered to be feasible.
##### 6.1.4.1.1 RF and digital front-end
Figure 6.1.4.1.1-1 illustrates examples of RF and digital front-end receiver
portions for the UMTS receiver that is also capable of receive diversity. An
example of front-end implementation of standalone time-dilated UMTS is shown
in Figure 6.1.4.1.1-2.
\- In both cases, a single local oscillator implementation is assumed for the
purpose of RF down-conversion.
\- The analog Low Pass Filter (LPF) is now a narrower bandwidth (5/N MHz) when
compared to the baseline case (5 MHz bandwidth).
\- The ADC sampling rate decreases linearly in accordance with the analog LPF
bandwidth.
\- The complexity of the digital filter is 1/N to an FIR implementation of the
UMTS FDD Square Root Raised Filter (roll-off factor = 0.22)

Figure 6.1.4.1.1-2: Front-end implementation for standalone time-dilated UMTS
An example of the front-end implementation for multicarrier time-dilated UMTS
is shown in Figure 6.1.4.1.1-3.\ This example assumes similar frond end
implementation as has been used in dual cell HSDPA. This implementation can be
used only in case two carrier signals are within the front-end sampling
bandwidth. Therefore carriers should be adjacent or nearly adjacent. Carrier
C1 has here been assumed to be the legacy carrier and C2 is the time-dilated
UMTS carrier. Hence carrier separation for C1 is similar to legacy DC-HSDPA
and only rotates signal to base band. Carrier separation for C2 needs to be
slightly changed from legacy since the centre frequency of the time-dilated
UMTS carrier can be different. Similar to the standalone case, the sampling
rate can be reduced and is beneficial for the rest of the receiver chain.
So far it has been assumed that in time-dilated UMTS bandwidth reduction is
handled by changing carrier distances within operators own band. Hence
additional filtering may not be needed. However, additional filtering, if
needed, would result in additional complexity. In any case filters are
required to support half and/or quarter bandwidths.

Figure 6.1.4.1.1-3: Front-end implementation for multicarrier time-dilated
UMTS
##### 6.1.4.1.2 Base-band detector
The differences in base-band processing of the HS-PDSCH detector between the
baseline and time-dilated UMTS receiver structures are examined in this
subclause.
The legacy UMTS UE receiver can be assumed to employ a linear MMSE receiver
operating in diversity mode as shown in Figure 6.1.4.1.2-1. Both the UMTS and
time-dilated UMTS UE receivers are required to estimate the channel impulse
response on the two receiving branches.
However, since the time duration of time-dilated UMTS is dilated by N times,
the length of the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) in unit of chips is reduced
to 1/N of the CIR length for the UMTS receiver. Furthermore, because the
sampling rate of time-dilated UMTS receiver is 1/N of the UMTS receiver, the
complexity of searcher while searching for the CIR timing and channel
estimator is 1/N^2^ of the UMTS receiver.
The complexity of LMMSE processing is scaled with the CIR length and sampling
rate. Similar to the searcher and channel estimation complexity, the length
and sampling rate of the linear equalizer in the time-dilated UMTS receiver
are both 1/N of the linear equalizer in the UMTS receiver. So the complexity
of LMMSE processing is also reduced to 1/N^2^ of the UMTS receiver. The
allocation of the fingers in the rake receiver or the decision how to measure
the impulse response in the type 3/3i receivers may need some fine tuning for
different sampling rates and bandwidths.
When doing initial synchronization the UE may need to search time-dilated UMTS
and legacy UMTS bandwidths, which could increase searcher complexity. However,
the complexity may be limited by signalling information on possible bandwidths
in each band. The same applies for neighbour cell measurements.
Figure 6.1.4.1.2-1: UMTS receiver: Base-band detector block diagram
##### 6.1.4.1.3 Base-band decoder
Since the data throughput and peak rate are expected to be 1/N of the UMTS FDD
system, the decoder complexity is also expected to be reduced to 1/N of the
UMTS decoder. Figure 6.1.4.1.3-1 illustrates a high level block diagram of the
base-band decoding process for both the UMTS and the time-dilated UMTS
receivers. For time-dilated UMTS, the IR buffer requirement is the same as
UMTS but the Turbo decoder speed requirement is reduced to 1/N.
Complexity of DCH decoding remains the same as legacy assuming that DCH
content remains the same, e.g. data rate of speech call is not affected by
time-dilated UMTS.
Figure 6.1.4.1.3-1: UMTS receiver: Base-band decoding
#### 6.1.4.2 UE transmitter
Uplink of time-dilated UMTS is assumed to be using reduced bandwidth only in
standalone case whereas legacy bandwidth is used in multicarrier. Changing the
system bandwidth has impact to transmission filters and possibly PA
implementations depending on the maximum transmission power.
In multicarrier scenarios, the HS-DPCCH feedback for the time-dilated UMTS
carrier needs to be accounted for. Assuming time dilation, there is feedback
for the secondary carrier in every Nth TTI. Feedback timing for the time-
dilated UMTS carrier needs to be defined.
In case UE supports only time-dilated UMTS and not legacy UMTS, the following
physical layer changes may be expected on the UL transmitter implementation:
\- Reduction of the physical layer processing speed by 1/N;
\- Reduction of the digital pulse shaping filter sampling rate by 1/N;
\- Reduction of the analog filter bandwidth to 1/N of UMTS FDD sampling rate.
#### 6.1.4.3 BS receiver
##### 6.1.4.3.1 RF and digital front-end
One example of front-end implementation for UMTS and time-dilated UMTS
receiver is shown in Figure 6.1.4.3.1-1. Received signal is filtered to the
LPF after RF down-conversion and then is sampled to generate digital signals
(ADC) for the rest of the receiver chain, i.e. carrier separation, pulse
shaping filter and demodulation.
Figure 6.1.4.3.1-1: Example block diagram of RF and digital front-end
Comparison:
\- The LPF handles a narrower bandwidth (5/N MHz) for time-dilated UMTS and 5
MHz bandwidth for baseline UMTS.
\- The ADC sampling rate decreases to 1/N of the baseline.
\- The pulse shaping filter handles a narrower bandwidth (5/N MHz) for time-
dilated UMTS and 5 MHz bandwidth for baseline UMTS.
##### 6.1.4.3.2 Base-band detector
The processing of decoder of time-dilated UMTS is the same as UMTS for a
transport block with a specific size per TTI, which means the peak rate or
throughput is 1/N since the TTI length of time-dilated UMTS is dilated by N
times, hence the complexity is 1/N of the UMTS FDD system.
#### 6.1.4.4 BS transmitter
##### 6.1.4.4.1 Base-band process
The transmitter need perform encoding, modulation, spreading, scrambling and
so on. All the same operation, assuming for the same TBS, is processed in N
time longer TTI for time-dilated UMTS, comparing to UMTS FDD system, therefore
the total complexity of time-dilated UMTS is 1/N of UMTS system.
##### 6.1.4.4.2 RF and digital front-end
Similar to the same part of receiver, the time-dilated UMTS system requires a
narrower bandwidth (5/N MHz) low pass filter, lower sampling rate(1/N) ADC and
narrower bandwidth (5/N MHz) pulse shaped filter.

In this part performance comparisons are presented, when DPCCH gating impact
is applied to both UMTS and time-dilated UMTS using 2.5 MHz of spectrum.

UMTS had gain in case of 0% and 50% gating pattern and loss in case of 75%
gating pattern because of longer gating slot. During gating slot, IPC gains
are hold. For VA30 and VA120, time-dilated UMTS had gain for all gating
pattern against UMTS except TBS 3119, 0% gating pattern in VA30.

##### 6.1.4.5.2 Impact to on-percentage due to time-dilation
The impact to on-percentage when CPC is enabled can be evaluated as described
in the following. The analysis focuses on the DL but is also applicable to UL.
Three cases can be distinguished:
  1. **Light traffic** period\ > In this case each burst is transmitted in one TTI. As the same CPC > parameters (in terms of TTI) are configured for legacy- and > time-dilated UMTS, the on-time percentage is the same. The on-time > percentage increase is zero.
  2. **Moderate traffic** period\ > In this case, each burst can be completely transmitted before the > next burst arrives. In spite of time dilation, the TBS transmitted > in each TTI remains roughly the same. Therefore the same numbers > of TTIs are required in legacy- and time-dilated UMTS. Given that > the inter-burst time is the same, time-dilated UMTS is occupied > for twice as long. Therefore time-dilated UMTS would have less > idle time. In this case time-dilated UMTS would see increase in > on-time percentage.
  3. **Heavy traffic** period\ > In this case, the next burst arrives before the previous burst is > completed. The DL is constantly active until the last burst > arrives. The same numbers of TTIs are required to deliver the > traffic in legacy- and time-dilated UMTS, but for the same heavy > traffic period both systems would see 100% on-time. As a result, > the on-time percentage increase is nearly zero.
The real scenario is a statistical mix of the 3 cases. The chosen traffic
profiles cover all of them.

Traffic Case focused on Ping Mix of light to moderate traffic Web browsing
(Amazon) Mix of moderate to heavy traffic Web browsing (CNN) Mix of moderate
to heavy traffic YouTube Mainly heavy traffic
* * *
Consequently, there is not much difference in on-time percentage for Ping or
YouTube. More pronounced difference can be seen for web browsing.
The battery performance is not only a function of the CPC on-time, but it is
also a function of the time the UE spends in different RRC states.
##### 6.1.4.5.2.1 Simulation Results {#simulation-results-2 .H6}

With the Ping traffic, on-time is increased from 6.85% for legacy UMTS to
7.48% for time-dilated UMTS (N=2) regardless of geometry and the number of Rx
antennas. This is because each burst (320 bits on the DL, 320 bits on the UL)
is always small enough to fit in the currently scheduled TBS. The on-time
percentage is small in light traffic. Consistent on-time increase in time-
dilated UMTS is seen as compared to legacy UMTS.
With web browsing traffic (CNN), the on-time is increased from around 40% for
legacy UMTS to around 60% for time-dilated UMTS (N=2) on the DL and from
around 25% to 35% on the UL. The increase is more significant on the DL where
data are transmitted than on the UL where TCP requests and acknowledgements
are transmitted. With web browsing traffic (Amazon), the numbers are more
uneven, but in general an increase of 9% on the DL and 6% on the UL from
legacy UMTS to time-dilated UMTS (N=2) can be observed.
With YouTube traffic, the on-time percentage on the DL for legacy UMTS is
fairly high, especially at low geometry and for single Rx. Consequently, for
single Rx, the largest difference occurs in the 10dB geometry case where the
on-time percentage on the DL increases from 63% for UMTS to 73% for time-
dilated UMTS (N=2). The difference is larger for dual Rx, especially at 0dB
geometry where the on-time percentage increases from 70% for legacy UMTS to
89% for time-dilated UMTS (N=2).
#### 6.1.4.6 Impact on network performance
##### 6.1.4.6.1 Impact on physical layer procedures
The time-dilated UMTS utilized dilated time units, e.g. chip, slot, TTI, and
frame, so that all time-related physical layer parameters in time-dilated UMTS
are scaled accordingly (i.e. dilated N times relative to UMTS), and also time
consumption of physical procedures are scaled accordingly, such as
synchronization, power control, random access, HARQ transmission (HS-DSCH-
related and E-DCH-related procedures) etc.
The impact of longer time duration on synchronization procedure is that the
time consumption will be extended.\ For cell search, it is assumed that the
SCH codes will not be changed and hence the time duration of cell search
operation will be extended accordingly. For synchronization parameters, such
as synchronization window length 40 ms and 160 ms are better to be dilated for
time-dilated UMTS, e.g. 240 slots instead of 160 ms, and 60 slots instead 40
ms.\ In addition, considering the usage of post-verification (as mentioned in
Synchronization procedure A in TS 25.214),\ the increase of initial
synchronization time due to time-dilated UMTS could be further reduced, i.e.
10 ms for N=2 and 30 ms for N=4.
From the link performance point of view, the impact of reduced ILPC (Inner
Loop Power Control) frequency is captured in the evaluation on voice and data
service in subclause 6.1.2. The reduced ILPC frequency due to time-dilated
UMTS is expected to have small impact on low and high speed UE since the power
control frequency tends to be sufficient for low speed UE and the power
control target is to track relative long term fading for high speed UE, and is
expected to have larger impact on moderate speed UE. It is for further study
if this can be improved by optimizing the power control step size for time-
dilated UMTS.
The impact of longer time duration on random access is that the time
consumption will increase, which is captured in subclause 6.1.1.4.
From the link performance point of view, the impact of increased HARQ-RTT is
shown in the evaluation on voice and data service in subclause 6.1.2. For
HSDPA, UE needs to feedback CQI, which is calculated based on a 3-slot
reference before the TTI where CQI is transmitted, and the CQI reference
length will be time-dilated by N times in time-dilated UMTS system. It is for
further study if the CQI reference length may be further optimized by
implementation, e.g. setting to other values such as 1 slot.
##### 6.1.4.6.2 Impact on higher layer timers
Longer time duration of sub-frame and frame has impact on the MAC timers such
as T2, Backoff timer TBO1, AG_Timer, and Non_Serving_RG_Timer, which are set
according to the length of TTI. These timers are expected to be dilated by N
times for time-dilated UMTS.
For RRC layer timers, since they are set to a large time granularity (in
hundreds of millisecond, second or minute), these values are sufficient enough
even for time-dilated UMTS. Hence it is not necessary to modify the value sets
of RRC timers.
##### 6.1.4.6.3 Impact on radio resource management
The radio resource management in RNC needs to be extended to support time
dilation.
As is the case for all optional features, RNC needs to keep track of which
time_dilated features are supported in different cells (e.g., standalone time
dilation N=2 with speech, standalone time dilation N=4 without speech, etc.)\
and take that into account together with UE capabilities when determining
where to setup radio links and what EUL/HS connection capabilities to
configure on those radio links.
New UE categories for UEs supporting time dilation will be introduced. It is
for further study exactly how these UE categories will be defined. The
relation between support of time dilation and support of other features needs
to be clarified as well, since it is unclear which of the already specified
features that are applicable to time-dilated operation. Potentially the RNC
will have to decide between steering a call towards a normal UMTS carrier with
a certain set of connection capabilities or a time-dilated UMTS carrier with
another set of connection capabilities. Further, such traffic steering needs
to take into account that the different carriers can be placed in different
bands, with different band characteristics. It is expected that proprietary
traffic steering load sharing implementations will have to be extended.
Depending on exactly what time-dilation alternatives are supported, the number
of different carrier types will differ, e.g.: standalone time-dilated N=2 with
speech, standalone time-dilated N=4 without speech, time-dilated N=2 as
aggregation carrier, time-dilated N=4 as aggregation carrier, time-dilated N=2
used as both standalone and aggregation carrier with speech support, etc.
If standalone time-dilated carriers do not support DCH speech (e.g. for N=4),
then inter-frequency handover needs to be triggered for UEs with ongoing
packet data connections on the time-dilated carrier when a request to setup
speech arrives from core network.
##### 6.1.4.6.3a Other issues relating to introduction of less time-dilated
carriers
The fact that time-dilated carriers will inherently be less capable than
normal UMTS carriers in terms of maximum bitrate, user plane latency, capacity
etc is a challenge that needs to be addressed. UEs supporting both normal and
time-dilated UMTS will at times be serviced by a time-dilated carrier,
depending upon RRM, thereby resulting in a lower maximum bitrate and increased
user plane latency than would otherwise be the case if the UE is serviced by
normal UMTS. Strategies (e.g. incentives) need to be developed and executed by
an operator that will ensure a good penetration of time-dilated UMTS capable
UEs even though the end user experience at times will be worse than if time
dilation was not supported taking the above issues into account. How the
operator can mitigate these negative consequences for end users is outside the
scope of this technical report. However, in any case it is expected that
traffic steering mechanisms would need to be extended to ensure good system
capacity with balanced end user performance.
The problem with lacking end user incentive to buy a UE capable of time
dilation is most clear for standalone operation. However, also in the carrier
aggregation case this is an issue, since then the main alternative to set up
e.g. a 5+2.5 MHz aggregation is to set up a 5+5 MHz aggregation if the
required bandwidth is available.
##### 6.1.4.6.4 KPI impact
Due to the longer radio frames, the SCH code words will also be spread over
time, and it will take longer time to acquire the synchronization channel
during cell search. Longer cell identification times may result in delayed
mobility procedures, which may have an impact on call retainability. However,
this has not been evaluated.
In general, unless absolute bitrates are kept for SRB signalling when going to
the narrower bandwidth, there will be negative impact on RRC procedure delays,
which in turn may result in delayed mobility procedures, which may have an
impact on call retainability. Further, as described in subclause 6.5.1.1, if
no solution to reduce SRB signalling delay is adopted the air-interface
portion of the call setup time procedure will double for time-dilation with
N=2 compared to normal UMTS.
End user perception may be impacted by the increased Round Trip Time (RTT) and
the lower bitrate capability on time-dilated carriers, see subclause 6.1.7.
It has been identified that there may be impact on the BCH mapped on P-CCPCH.
If P-CCPCH bitrate is decreased due to time dilation, then access latency will
increase. The exact impact, if any, depends on if absolute bitrate is kept or
not in the final specified solution.
A changed SFN clock can impact the DRX cycle for paging since that is based on
SFN. It is for further study what the impact on signalling is to be able to
keep the existing DRX cycles also with time-dilated UMTS. If DRX cycles become
inherently longer with time dilation this will lead to increased latency, e.g.
for mobile terminated speech calls.
It is assumed that a normal UMTS carrier is deployed whenever the available
bandwidth is sufficient for that, and that radio resource management and
mobility algorithms do not have to consider handover between a normal UMTS
carrier and two N=2 time-dilated carriers in the same frequency allocation.
Such a deployment would lead to soft handover being replaced by inter-
frequency handover between carriers of different types, which could be
expected to have impact on KPIs.
##### 6.1.4.6.5 Hardware complexity impact - summary
[Editor\'s Note: This text is put here as a general discussion on hardware
complexity.\ The current structure of the present document splits complexity
into four different clauses,\ and the discussion presented here is valid for
all.]
As described in subclause 6.1.4.1-6.1.4.4 there is impact on both radio and
baseband hardware both in NodeB and UE to support the new bandwidth and chip
rate. Since the chip rate is a very fundamental parameter in any CDMA system,
it is not unlikely that the hardware impact can be very large for certain
implementations. It is also possible that other implementations offer the
possibility to change the chip rate quite flexibly.
##### 6.1.4.6.6 Site migration
Deploying additional time-dilated carriers within a NodeB site with existing
normal UMTS carriers will lead to one of several possible site migration
scenarios when it comes to radio equipment (power amplifiers etc.):
\- Installation of new power amplifier hardware to supported the added time-
dilated carrier;
\- Share power with already existing carriers on already installed power
amplifier hardware.\ This will lead to reduced power capability of the
existing normal UMTS carriers.
\- Utilizing unused power capability in already installed power amplifier
hardware.
Hence, the impact on the site at migration depends on the operator's detailed
migration scenario and the installed hardware capabilities.
It should be noted that the overall capacity and end user performance impact
of a migration where power is moved from normal UMTS carriers to time-dilated
carriers will depend on the penetration of time-dilation capable UEs.\ If this
penetration is low the capacity loss on normal UMTS carriers can be larger
than the capacity benefit from the additional time-dilated carrier.
##### 6.1.4.6.7 UE battery consumption
An implication of longer radio frames is that for fixed packet size type
traffic, especially when the packet sizes are relatively small, the
transmitter and receiver on times in the UE will be lengthened due to the
longer transmission times and HARQ cycles, which will have an impact on UE
battery life. There is also likely to be an increase in the amount of packets
handled by the network simultaneously, which could lead to an increase in
overhead or decrease in efficiency.
The burst rate of a time-dilated carrier will be lower than that of a normal
UMTS carrier. Therefore, the total time the UE spends in CELL_DCH to transfer
a certain amount of bits will be higher with time-dilated UMTS.
##### 6.1.4.6.8 O&M, parameter management
As mentioned in subclause 6.1.5.5, a set of new RB combinations needs to be
defined. The time-dilated RB combinations would need to be managed in RNC. In
addition to physical layer parameters, new MAC/RLC parameters and timer values
for time-dilated UMTS cells need to be managed (see subclause 6.6). Earlier,
the MAC/RLC and timer values used were typically aligned between all cells,
while with time-dilated UMTS, an additional set of optimal parameter values
need to be introduced. Some parameters can maybe be scaled directly as a
function of the time dilation factor (and RTT), but others use optimal values
that do not depend solely on the RTT and hence maybe be difficult to decide by
simple rules. Simulations may be required to derive optimal values for those
parameters.
Also other parameters in various areas may need to be updated and managed
separately for time-dilated UMTS cells. Tentative examples include:
\- Power control parameters due to the new power control update rate (no
longer 1500 Hz)
\- Compressed mode parameters. What impact the inter-frequency and inter-RAT
measurements have on compressed mode operation needs further study. E.g.,
reasonable compressed mode patterns need to be found, taking the limitation of
one transmission gap per radio frame into account. If it is not possible to
get reasonable measurement performance with this limitation when radio frames
become longer, then multiple transmission gaps may need to be enabled in one
radio frame. The need and feasibility of this is left for further study.
\- CPC parameters. Due to the time dilation optimal parameters may differ from
legacy UMTS CPC.
\- Synchronization parameters due to the new radio frame length
\- Power-related parameters. E.g. if the same cell size is required for time-
dilated UMTS cells as for normal UMTS cells, then the values of various power
related information elements are decreased by 10log~10~(N),\ where N is the
dilation factor. Examples of such parameters include e.g. Qrxlevmin.
##### 6.1.4.6.9 Timing relations
So far it has been assumed that all control loops like inner loop power
control, HARQ, etc. are simply scaled in time. However, since the current
control loops requirements have been derived with assumptions on processing
times in UE and NodeB, and these processing times do not scale linearly with
time dilation factor N, there exist some optimization possibilities in these
control loops for time-dilated UMTS. This can be done in order to reduce the
inner loop power control delay, the HARQ retransmissions delay, etc. It is for
further study if such optimizations shall be applied to the time dilation
scheme.
In the multi-RAT carrier aggregation case, where a UMTS cell is serving cell
and a time-dilated UMTS cell is secondary serving cell, the two cells involved
in communication to one dual-cell UE will have different subframe lengths.
This may lead to some complications, since earlier it has been assumed that
serving and secondary serving cells have identical timings (all subframes
perfectly aligned through use of same Tcell values). This may impact NodeB and
UE implementations.
##### 6.1.4.6.10 Scheduler impact
In general, with a longer TTI length the degrees of freedom available to the
scheduler in meeting differing QoS requirements of different traffic types
will be reduced and the impact of this reduced flexibility on system
efficiency and KPIs should be investigated. There may be a need to improve
scheduler implementation in NodeB to avoid negative effects in this area.
It is also foreseen that the different TTI lengths on serving and secondary
serving cells in an aggregation scenario will impact the HS scheduler
implementation. The exact impact depends on the baseline scheduler
implementation.
The time dilation may also have impact on the EUL scheduler, depending on if
there is a need to modify grant scheduling for different time dilation
factors.
##### 6.1.4.6.11 Positioning
With time dilation, the chip time is increased. This can negatively impact the
resolution of time measurements, such as RTT measurement for positioning. The
detailed impact due to the reduced time resolution is for further study.
##### 6.1.4.6.12 Impact on system information
With time-dilated UMTS, information about the time dilation factor (or chip
rate) needs to be associated with every cell. This information has to be
signalled to the UE in some use cases, both in idle mode (in system
information) and in connected mode (in signalling radio bearers).
No conclusion on exactly how this information shall be represented has been
agreed between RAN2 and RAN4. However, it cannot be ruled out that this
information will result in some additional bits to be transmitted in system
information. Depending on how full the BCH channel is this may result in need
for changed SIB scheduling or reduction of other information in the existing
SIBs (e.g. number of neighbours in neighbour lists).
##### 6.1.4.6.13 Impact on other RATs
Time dilation will impact RRM procedures, particularly in the area of inter-
frequency and inter-RAT measurements.\ As stated in subclause 6.1.5.2.4 and
its subclauses, there is a tradeoff between keeping measurement duration and
keeping measurement requirements. For now it remains unclear how the final
requirements would be formulated.\ In any case, measurement performance needs
to be secured for measurements on normal UMTS FDD, time-dilated UMTS FDD, LTE,
GERAN and the various UMTS TDD chip rate options. There is impact in both
directions, i.e. a UE operating on a time-dilated UMTS carrier needs to be
able to measure on e.g. LTE carriers and a UE operating on LTE carrier needs
to be able to measure on a time-dilated UMTS carrier. Hence, impact in this
area is not limited only to WCDMA RAN, but also other RATs will be impacted by
introduction of time-dilated UMTS.
### 6.1.5 Impacts on specifications
#### 6.1.5.1 Impact to RAN1 specifications
The assumptions made include the following:
\- HS-SCCH and HS-PDSCH TTI: N*2 ms on time-dilated cell
\- No MBMS support in time-dilated cell
\- No STTD support on dedicated channels in time-dilated cell
\- No change is done to uplink/downlink timing relation at UE to enable e.g.
lower TPC delay in time-dilated cells
\- SFN (and also CFN) is increased by one every radio frame, i.e. SFN clock is
running with different absolute rate on UMTS and time-dilated UMTS cells
\- No need for compressed mode patterns with more than one transmission gap
per radio frame when time-dilated UMTS is introduced
\- No impact on ACK/NACK & CQI coding with introduction of time-dilated cells.
\- Maximum carrier aggregation is one UMTS carrier + one time-dilated UMTS
carrier
If the above assumptions would not hold, there may be additional specification
impact.
Further, it has been assumed that time-dilated UMTS shall offer similar level
of functionality as normal UMTS, so that the existing specifications and
structure can be reused.
**TS 25.201**
The clauses of TS 25.201 that are impacted by the time-dilated UMTS solution
are listed in Table 6.1.5.1-1.\ The changes required primarily comprise
scaling all time values by a factor N and the FDD bandwidth/chip-rate value by
a factor 1/N (e.g., 10 ms becomes N*10 ms and 3.84 Mcps becomes 3.84/N Mcps
where N=1, 2 or 4).\ In addition, the entire concept of additional operation
modes for UMTS FDD needs to be introduced. These additional operation modes
can be described as different chip rate options similar to the different UMTS
TDD chip rates.\ A complication here is that with carrier aggregation multiple
chip rates are used simultaneously, so exactly how to introduce and describe
these new modes of operation is TBD.

**TS 25.215**
The clauses of TS 25.215 that are impacted by the time-dilated UMTS solution
are listed in Table 6.1.5.1-6.\ The changes required primarily comprise
scaling all TTI values and all radio frame time values by a factor N (e.g. 10
ms becomes N*10 ms where N=1, 2 or 4), and these changes are not explicitly
mentioned below.\ See comment below clause title in Table 6.1.5.1-6 for other
types of changes in TS 25.215.

In summary RAN4 foresees impact on the following RAN4 specifications with
introduction of time-dilated UMTS.
**Base Station:\ 25.104:** Base Station (BS) radio transmission and reception
(FDD).\ The impact is due to new BS core requirements (or extension of the
existing requirements to time-dilated UMTS case) and new BS performance
requirements.\ **25.141:** Base Station (BS) conformance testing (FDD)\ The BS
conformance testing specification will be affected accordingly. Additionally
the corresponding MSR specifications will be affected:**\ 37.104:** E-UTRA,
UTRA and GSM/EDGE; Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base Station (BS) radio
transmission and reception\ **37.141:** E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE; Multi-
Standard Radio (MSR) Base Station (BS) conformance testing
**User Equipment:\ 25.101:** User Equipment (UE) radio transmission and

of the existing requirements to time-dilated UMTS case) and new UE performance
requirements.
**25.133:** Requirements for support of radio resource management (FDD).\ RRM
core and performance requirements.
**36.133:** Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Requirements

Additionally RAN4 foresees potential impact on other RAT specification which
needs to be further investigated as follows:
**36.104:** \"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Base
Station (BS) radio transmission and reception\", because of coexistence and
also depending on whether new interferer types need to be introduced.
**36.101:** \"Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); User
Equipment (UE) radio transmission and reception\", because of coexistence and
also depending on whether new interferer types need to be introduced.
Additionally RAN4 foresees potential impact on the following specifications,
however detailed analysis has not been provided and needs to be further
investigated:
**25.106:** \"UTRA repeater radio transmission and reception\" (and
accordingly the repeater conformance testing specification **25.107**).
**25.111:** Location Measurement Unit (LMU) performance specification; User
Equipment (UE) positioning in UTRAN.
**25.113:** \"Base Station (BS) and repeater electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC)\" and the corresponding MSR specification **37.113**.
**25.144:** User Equipment (UE) and Mobile Station (MS) over the air
performance requirements.
##### 6.1.5.2.1 General
Time-dilated UMTS carriers with 1/2 or 1/4 of the chip rate of a normal
carrier need to be distinguished from each other and from the normal carrier
that has the same center frequency. This means the same UARFCN alone cannot be
used for all cases. Several solutions could be considered, i.e. to assign a
new UARFCN to each new chip-rate variation for every possible channel position
or other solutions. The solution defined in RAN4 may have implications in
RAN2.
RAN4 also has identified open aspects related to UARFCN as follows:
\- Discuss whether the current UARFCN range is sufficient (currently the
UARFCN range is 0...16383.\ The largest reserved value to date is 10849 (from
TS 25.101).
\- Whether to consider the same channel raster or additional channel raster
finer than 200 kHz may be considered for time-dilated UMTS in order to provide
deployment flexibility within the spectrum operator owns.
\- The final decision on the channel raster has implication on the multi-
carrier scenarios agreed in RAN1. It may or may not affect conclusions in RAN1
study for the multi-carrier scenario.
\- It should be noted that if a finer frequency raster is necessary for the RF
analog part of the radio, the comparator frequency of the synthesizer may need
to be lowered depending on implementation.\ In this case the synthesizer spurs
will have a lower frequency content and the loop filter of the synthesizer
needs to be lowered. This may have implications related to phase noise on some
implementations.
It should be noted that this aspect requires coordination with RAN2.
##### 6.1.5.2.2 BS RF core and performance requirements
For BS core and test requirements, the specifications impacted due to
introducing time-dilated UMTS include TS 25.104, TS 25.141, TS 37.104 and TS
37.141.
The time-dilated UMTS configurations will be introduced in the specification
depending on the feasibility analysis.\ The same Tx-Rx separation as in legacy
UMTS would be applicable for time-dilated UMTS.
##### 6.1.5.2.2.1 BS transmitter core requirements {#bs-transmitter-core-
requirements .H6}
Due to the new bandwidth for time-dilated UMTS, the majority of the
transmitter requirements will need to be redefined.
The BS output power of small power class may need some modifications to take
into account the decision on PSD level.
No impact is foreseen for frequency error, primary and secondary CPICH power
accuracy requirement.
The available power range for the code domain compared to the total power
shall be kept unchanged in order to keep the same flexibility of code domain
power adjustment for time-dilated UMTS. The minimum total power when no
traffic channels are activated is determined by the minimum power of basic
control channel and also shall be kept unchanged for time-dilated UMTS.
Therefore, power control dynamic range and total power dynamic range compared
to the maximum total power can be unchanged.
Output RF spectrum emissions will be highly affected by the introduction of
time-dilated UMTS. In particular this will depend on the assumptions related
to time-dilated UMTS, i.e.:
\- nominal bandwidth;
\- assumptions in terms of PSD.
The following provides a brief initial assessment of the impact for each
individual requirement present in TS 25.104.
\- Occupied bandwidth requirement for time-dilated UMTS with new scalable chip
rates needs to be introduced.
\- New SEM requirements for time-dilated UMTS should be defined. The
definition should take into account co-existence study result and BS
implementation feasibility. See subclause 6.1.6.1.\ The ACLR is a direct
measure of the interference which is leaking in adjacent spectrum. New ACLR
requirements for time-dilated UMTS should be defined. The type of adjacent
channel should be studied for time-dilated UMTS carrier when defining ACLR
requirement for each chip rate of time-dilated UMTS. ACLR is directly linked
to ACIR which directly impact the interference generated by time-dilated UMTS
to other carriers, other RATs or other operators and hence it should be
studied carefully. Note also that the ACLR is defined by considering an
integration bandwidth of 5MHz for both the wanted signal and the interfering
adjacent carrier. With the introduction of time-dilated UMTS new type of
adjacent channel should be considered. In particular ACLR may be defined for
symmetric adjacent channels (same channel bandwidth as the wanted time-dilated
UMTS carrier) and for legacy UMTS adjacent carriers.
\- Spurious emission requirements include regulatory and co-existence
requirement. Regulatory requirements are mandatory for deployment and must
therefore be met. Co-existence requirements depend on the noise figure of the
receiver of protected system. Appropriate values and measurement bandwidth for
the spurious emission need to be considered by taking into account the time-
dilated UMTS itself and other RATs systems protection needs.\ Additionally,
the introduction of time-dilated UMTS may impact other RATs spurious emissions
(to protect scalable UMTS systems).
\- The transmit intermodulation is the capability of the transmitter to
inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear elements caused by
presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna. The interfering signal is defined currently as a
UTRA modulated signal. The transmit intermodulation requirements will be
affected by the introduction of time-dilated UMTS. Namely, the type of
interfering signal and offset values needs to be redefined for time-dilated
UMTS carrier.
\- Transmit modulation requirements are determined by the system performance
requirement. Analysis has not been conducted to understand whether the same
EVM requirements as for legacy UMTS can be considered also for time-dilated
UMTS. Hence, while it is desirable to keep them unchanged, analysis is needed
in order to understand the implication of this choice.
\- The transmit pulse shape filter can be reused for time-dilated UMTS if the
same roll-off factor as for legacy is considered. However, the chip rate needs
to be modified for time-dilated UMTS.
\- The peak domain error may need to be re-evaluated in order to take into
account the new waveform corresponding to the new nominal bandwidth.
\- Time alignment error requirement is for ensuring the demodulation
performance of diversity, MIMO and carrier aggregation. For time-dilated UMTS,
the TAE requirement between each branch in MIMO and the TAE between UMTS and
time-dilated UMTS carrier may be kept unchanged. It should be noted that
multi-carrier operations should be taken into account for the definition of
the core requirements, by considering TS 37.104 and TS 25.104.
##### 6.1.5.2.2.2 BS receiver core requirements {#bs-receiver-core-
requirements .H6}
The time-dilated UMTS can be deployed either as stand-alone or in carrier
aggregation with UMTS carriers. In case of standalone time-dilated UMTS
deployment the uplink follows the time-dilated UMTS carrier scaling. Due to
the new bandwidth for time-dilated UMTS, all the receive requirements will
need to be redefined. In case of multi-carrier operation when time-dilated
UMTS is deployed together with legacy UMTS, the study item considers a single
uplink carrier anchored to the 5MHz downlink carrier. Hence for multi-RAT
scenarios a limited impact is foreseen.
The following provides a brief initial assessment of the impact for each
individual requirement.
\- New reference measurement channels for time-dilated UMTS need to be defined
first and all the receiver requirement need to be specified based on the new
reference measurement channels.
\- REFSENS is specified so far supporting that modulated signal is occupying
5MHz case. For time-dilated UMTS carrier, the same noise figure of base
station receiver should be kept (due to the same hardware design) but new
study would be needed on the demodulated SNR. Hence new REFSENS values will be
defined.
\- Receiver dynamic range is the receiver ability to handle a rise of
interference in the reception frequency channel. The wanted signal power needs
to be studied on the demodulated SNR for time-dilated UMTS and interference
level should be determined depending on UE power decision. The ACS, in-band
blocking and intermodulation requirement is defined in current specification
for an interferer with 5MHz UMTS modulated signal. When introducing time-
dilated UMTS, the interferer bandwidth shall be changed in order to consider
the presence of time-dilated UMTS interferer, the offset levels should be
changed in order to take into account new bandwidth. Moreover the interferer
power level should be studied further, depending on the uplink PSD decision.
\- The narrow-band blocking and out-of-band blocking requirement is defined in
current specification for an interferer either GMSK modulated signal or CW
signal to capture the co-existence with GSM system in the same band and any
other system in other bands. These two requirements will need to be redefined
for time-dilated UMTS. The offset level should be changed in order to take
into account new bandwidth. The interferer levels can be reused.
\- The RX spurious emissions follow the TX spurious emissions. Therefore, the
same applies.
New test requirements for time-dilated UMTS, corresponding to the core
requirements which are mentioned above should also be introduced. Test model
defined in TS 25.141 also need to be changed for time-dilated UMTS.

##### 6.1.5.2.2.3 BS performance requirements {#bs-performance-requirements
.H6}
The BS performance requirements will be affected for standalone time-dilated
UMTS scenarios when the UE uses time-dilated UMTS to transmit the data. Both
legacy UMTS and HS-related requirements would be affected, as time-dilated
UMTS would be used to carry both HS traffic and UMTS.
BS performance requirements in TS 25.104 are currently defined under several
assumptions specifically developed for the 5 MHz channel bandwidth. Changing
the bandwidth would imply changes of some of the assumptions (depending on RAN
1/RAN 4 agreements), which in turn will impact the BS performance
requirements. Extensive simulation work is needed to set new requirements in
accordance to the new assumptions.
For the time being no impacts on BS performance requirements for multicarrier
time-dilated UMTS scenarios is foreseen.
The channel propagation conditions and the path positions should be carefully
reviewed to avoid more adverse conditions. The fading propagation channels
which are aligned with the chip rate shall be redefined (Case 3, 4).\ For
these channels the path delay position is the chip positions for 3.84 Mcps,
that is, 260 * N [ns]. If the chip rate is changed, the path delays are put on
the sub-chip position because of the possible extended chip duration and it
causes inter-symbol interference which may lead to different demodulation
performance. Also in cases of other multipath propagation conditions, where
the path delays are not assigned to chip positions, extension of chip duration
will lead to different timing relations between the delay of particular path
and chip positions, however in these cases redefinition of channel models is
not required. Nevertheless, this behaviour may cause different demodulation
performance as well.
All BS performance requirements are defined for particular reference
measurement channels which shall be modified due to chip rate scaling.
Modifications of reference channels shall apply at least to spreading factor
or information bit rate which scale with the same factor as chip rate.
Taking the above into account, the table below presents a list of BS
performance requirements of TS 25.104 which would need additional minimum
values due to potential introduction of time-dilated UMTS.

##### 6.1.5.2.3 UE RF core and performance requirements
##### 6.1.5.2.3.1 UE transmitter core requirements {#ue-transmitter-core-
requirements .H6}
Several transmitter core requirements will be affected by the introduction of
time-dilated UMTS. Note that the only in case of standalone time-dilated UMTS
the UE is required to transmit by using a reduced bandwidth. In the following
the analysis is mainly applicable to standalone time-dilated UMTS case.
The maximum transmit power depends on the PA characteristics. Unless a
dedicated PA is considered as baseline architecture the maximum achievable
transmit power could be considered to be the same also for time-dilated UMTS.
However, the maximum transmit power used by the UE for time-dilated UMTS may
be affected pending the decisions on same PSD or higher PSD for time-dilated
UMTS.
The CM characteristics will change for time-dilated UMTS. The ranges of CM
will need to be revisited as well as the reference waveform. Consequently the
amount of allowed MPR will need to be re-discussed.
No major changes foreseen for relative code domain power accuracy.
For the following requirements:
\- frequency error,
\- minimum output power,
\- output power dynamics,
\- inner loop power control,
\- out of synchronization handling of output power,
\- transmit ON/OFF time mask,
\- change of TFC,
\- power setting in uplink compressed mode,
\- HS-PDCCH transmitter power step tolerances.
Transients and measurement periods are defined according to the legacy WCDMA
system. Depending on the final solution chosen in RAN1, e.g. dilation of
timing, these will need to be revisited in order to achieve similar
performance as for legacy UMTS.
Additionally minimum output power and ON/OFF time mask may be affected because
of the required power level when a reduced bandwidth is considered.
The occupied bandwidth will change according to the decided nominal
bandwidths.
SEM may need to be redesigned by taking into account that for time-dilated
UMTS the bandwidth is reduced wrt to the 5MHz bandwidth used so far (the
requirements are defined starting from 2.5MHz away from the carrier).\ See
subclause 6.1.6.3 for some initial discussion on SEM. Note that the SEM is a
regulatory requirements and the emission levels of time-dilated UMTS will need
to comply with the necessary limits in various country.
The ACLR is a direct measure of the interference which is leaking in adjacent
spectrum. The same analysis as for BS ACLR for standalone time-dilated UMTS is
applicable for UE ACLR.
For spurious emissions it should be noted that new values may need to be
defined in order to protect Scalable UMTS systems (e.g. changing on the
integration bandwidth and analysis of the value needed to protect other
Scalable UMTS is required).
For transmit intermodulation the same discussion as for BS transmitter is
applicable.
For transmit modulation (pulse shape filter, EVM, peak and relative code
domain power) the same discussion as for BS transmitter is applicable.
If the same PA is considered for the UE supporting time-dilated UMTS phase
discontinuity requirements may not be affected.
A table capturing the detailed summary of the new requirements which need to
be introduced is missing.
##### 6.1.5.2.3.2 UE receiver core requirements {#ue-receiver-core-
requirements .H6}
In the time-dilated UMTS downlink, the UE would be required to receive the
signal according to several possible configurations. In particular, the UE can
receive a single time-dilated UMTS carrier in a _standalone_ configuration, or
a time-dilated UMTS carrier as a supplemental downlink carrier in a multi-
carrier configuration. The scenarios and the configurations agreed will need
to be introduced in the specifications and captured depending on the
capability of the UE.
Changes in channel bandwidth may require changes in the UE RX RF filters.
Since the concept of _flexible bandwidth_ is already used in LTE, there is no
technical reason why this cannot be done in UMTS; however, ,the receive
channel filtering may need to be optimized for UMTS with the new bandwidth. In
the following an initial assessment of the impact of time-dilated UMTS on the
UE receiver core specification is provided for main RF UE core requirements.
Multi-carrier scenarios can be introduced in the specification by considering
the exact operator scenario as shown in the above subclause or by considering
the nominal spacing between the center carriers. In case exact operator
configurations are considered the spacing between the center carriers is
reduced.
**REFERENCE SENSITIVITY LEVEL:** **New requirements need to be specified for
time-dilated UMTS for both standalone and multi-carrier scenarios. If the
multi-carrier scenarios as described in the above subclauses are introduced as
such into the specification then new REFSENS requirements may be needed for
the legacy UMTS carrier in the multi-carrier scenarios for some cases
(potential impact for N=2).**
> One of the main UE receive core requirement is the Reference Sensitivity
> level (REFSENS).\ REFSENS is the basis for most of the UE receiver core
> requirement. ACS, Blocking and Intermodulation requirements in fact are all
> based on the sensitivity level. These values are defined with units of
> dBm/3.84MHz, i.e. they assume UMTS chip rate. These requirements should be
> re-written for any change in chip rate and bandwidth. In addition, a new
> corresponding Reference Measurement Channel (RMC) for each new time-dilated
> UMTS chip rate needs to be defined in order to be able to measure REFSENS.
> Since the SNR requirement for these new RMCs may differ from the existing
> one for 3.84 Mcps, the REFSENS requirements need to be re-evaluated for each
> new chip rate.
>
> The REFSENS depends on how the physical layer will be defined in RAN1.New
> requirements will be needed also for the multi-carrier configuration agreed
> with time-dilated UMTS and UMTS carriers.
>
> REFSENS values could be influenced by the exact filter design of the front-
> end analog filter for time-dilation UMTS. However, these aspects are subject
> to implementation.
**MAXIMUM INPUT LEVEL:** **New requirements need to be specified for time-
dilated UMTS.**
> The maximum input level is defined in TS 25.101 equal to -25dBm /3.84MHz.
> The maximum input level is implicitly a requirement on the ADC to make sure
> that the ADC is capable of handling a certain dynamic range. If the ADC
> linearity region can be considered the same as for legacy UE then the time-
> dilated UMTS UE will be able to handle the corresponding input level (wrt to
> nominal bandwidth which will be agreed). It can be discussed further whether
> the maximum input level is rescaled depending on the nominal bandwidth (as
> it is done for multi-carrier aggregation in legacy WCDMA up to dual carrier)
> or if it is considered as an absolute value (independent from the bandwidth
> as in LTE and for legacy WCDMA for number of carriers>2).
>
> The minimum requirements in terms of throughput vs. Ec/Ior will need to be
> re-evaluated for both standalone carriers and multi RAT-configurations.
**ADJACENT CHANNEL SELECTIVITY:** **New requirements need to be specified for
time-dilated UMTS for standalone and multicarrier configurations. New
requirements may need to be considered for legacy UMTS carrier in the multi-
carrier scenarios depending on the blocker assumption. New requirements for
the legacy UMTS carrier when time-dilated UMTS is the blocker may be needed.**
> The introduction of time-dilated UMTS may require the definition of new
> interferer types which corresponds to time-dilated UMTS carrier with
> different nominal bandwidth. The ACS is defined in two different cases with
> a UMTS modulated interferer located at 5MHz wrt the center of the wanted
> carrier. In the case of time-time-dilated UMTS the same requirements will
> need to be defined at least for a time-time-dilated UMTS wanted carrier with
> a time-time-dilated UMTS modulated interferer located at an offset which is
> at least equal to the time-time-dilated UMTS bandwidth. It will need to be
> discussed further whether the power levels of the interferers with respect
> to the wanted signal could be possibly maintained, or whether changes are
> needed. Additionally the characteristics of the time-dilated modulated
> interferer may need further discussion pending decisions in RAN1 (compared
> to the WCDMA modulated interferer defined in Table C.7 in TS 25.101).
>
> The requirement will need to be defined for all the time-dilated UMTS
> bandwidths which will be introduced in the specifications.
>
> Whether or not to introduce ACS requirement for all the combinations of
> time-dilated UMTS bandwidth for the wanted signal and the interference
> signal need to be decided. It may be possible to limit the number of test
> cases as done in E-UTRA specification (ACS requirements for carrier
> bandwidth xMHz are defined only for an interferer xMHz wide).
>
> New requirement will need to be defined also for the multi-carrier scenarios
> for configurations based on the aggregation of time-Dilation UMTS and UMTS
> carriers. The definition of new time-dilated UMTS interferer types may have
> some implications also on other RAT specifications, e.g. discussions are
> needed whether the introduction of new interferer types requires the
> introduction of new requirements for legacy UMTS (and other RATs) in the
> presence of time-dilated UMTS interferers.
**BLOCKING REQUIREMENTS:** **New requirements need to be specified for time-
dilated UMTS standalone and multi-carrier configurations. New requirements may
be needed for legacy UMTS carrier in the multi-carrier scenarios.**
> Blocking requirements include in-band blocking, out of band blocking and
> narrowband blocking requirements. In general new definitions of blocking
> requirements are required for a time-dilated UMTS carrier when the blocker
> is a time-dilated UMTS carrier with at least equal bandwidth for both
> standalone and multi-carrier scenarios.
>
> The requirement will need to be rewritten by taking into account new channel
> bandwidths for the interferer and the wanted signal. As for ACS power levels
> and offset values need further discussions and evaluations.
>
> In LTE for example the offset wrt the REFSENS value depends on the channel
> bandwidth, while the interferer is kept constant. The same approach could be
> considered for time-dilated UMTS; more analysis is needed on this topic. The
> requirement (the BER level) shall be re-evaluated depending on the new test
> conditions.
>
> For all the blocking requirements, in case of multi-carrier scenarios new
> requirements need to be defined not only for the time-dilated UMTS carrier
> but also for the legacy UMTS carrier.
>
> The in-band blocking requirement is defined for a W-CDMA modulated
> interferer. The new requirements shall be based on a new time-dilated UMTS
> modulated interferer whose characteristics may need to be modified to

##### 6.1.5.2.3.3 UE performance requirements {#ue-performance-requirements
.H6}
**General**
In TS 25.101, existing demodulation requirements are organised into clause 8
(performance requirements for R99 channels), clause 9 (performance
requirements for HSDPA, clause 10 (performance requirements for E-DCH) and
clause 11 (performance requirements for MBMS). Depending on RAN1 decisions on
the functionality of a possible Scalable UMTS work item, it is anticipated
that these clauses would need to be extended with requirements for time-
dilated UMTS operating at all relevant chip rates. In general, the following
tasks would need to be performed to extend the specification for other chip
rates.
\- Discussion and agreement on the relevant reference receiver types for time-
dilated UMTS, e.g. whether all of type 0, type 1, type 2, type 3 and type 3i
receiver types are relevant for time-dilated UMTS implementations. However,
since all enhanced receiver requirements currently defined in TS 25.101 are
extensions and enhancement of type 0 requirements, it is anticipated that the
baseline type 0 performance needs to be accounted.
\- Discussion and agreement of the general framework and test case list for
time-dilated UMTS. Not all test cases for 3.84 Mcps may be relevant for time-
dilated UMTS depending on future decisions about the functionalities that are
defined for time-dilated UMTS. For example, it is necessary to understand
whether Rel-11 or Rel-12 UTMS features are included in time-dilated UMTS in
the first instance. In addition, the UE demodulation performance may be
considered partially verified already by the existing test cases, assuming
that all time-dilated UMTS UEs are also required to support 3.84 Mcps
operation. However, it would also be necessary to ensure good requirements
coverage at fractional chip rates, to ensure the expected time-dilated UMTS
system performance in practical deployments.
\- Discussion and agreement of reference measurement channels and OCNS
modelling for time-dilated UMTS
\- Discussion and agreement of propagation conditions for time-dilated UMTS.
This has been discussed to an extent during the study item and further
considerations are provided below
\- Alignment simulations of time-dilated UMTS cases.
\- Simulation of impairment margins and agreement of requirements based on
some agreed methodology e.g. averaging of results.
\- Change requests to introduce time-dilated UMTS requirements to TS 25.101

To develop corresponding channel models for time-dilated UMTS, two possible
approaches can be envisaged.\ The relative delay may be scaled according to
the chip rate (e.g. multiplied by 2 or 4 for ½ or ¼ chip rate time-dilated
UMTS). In principle, this should give quite similar performance to the 3.84
Mcps performance level since the channel profile is scaled equivalently to the
chip rate itself. Alternatively, if the channels are considered to have
physical meaning based on typical conditions experienced in deployments, they
may be used unscaled which means that the time-dilated UMTS receiver will
experience shorter relative delays in units of chips, compared to the full
chip rate receiver. Thus, somewhat different performance levels can be
anticipated.
For HSDPA, ITU channel models are used to verify the performance as shown in
table 6.1.5.2.3.3-3.

Since the ITU channel models have relative delays which are not related to the
chip rate of the UE and are representative of conditions experienced in
deployment, it would not be appropriate to scale the relative delays of
channel taps. Therefore, the UE performance can be expected to be somewhat
different from 3.84 Mcps performance, even in alignment simulations, since the
UE receiver experiences a different tap delay relative to its own chip rate.
Subject to the availability of MBMS and MBSFN with time-dilated UMTS in the
work item, similarly channel models used for MBMS (TS 25.101 table B.1.D) and
MBSFN (TS 25.101 table B.1.E) testing are based on conditions which may be
considered relevant for practical deployment, and would not be scaled for
time-dilated UMTS.
A number of channels have been defined for stress testing of the UE receiver
and need special consideration. These are moving propagation conditions
(B.2.3), birth death propagation conditions (B.2.4) and high speed train
condition (B.2.5). For moving propagation conditions and birth death
propagation conditions, RAN4 should discuss the relevant stress tests for a
lower chip rate receiver. For high speed train condition, the characteristics
depend on train velocity, distances between the node Bs and distance between
each node B and the track. Therefore it is not anticipated that high speed
train propagation condition would be modified for the work on time-dilated
UMTS, although the UE performance with the different chip rates needs to be
simulated.
Finally, MIMO propagation conditions defined in TS 25.101 annex B.2.6.1,
B.2.6.2 and B.2.6.3 may be straightforwardly reused for time-dilated UMTS
since the channels are all single tap channel.
##### 6.1.5.2.4 RRM requirements
A number of existing RRM requirements defined for the UE and Node B
measurements are met over certain physical layer measurement period or
evaluation time. These existing RRM requirements are defined for the current
chip rate and bandwidth of 3.84 Mcps and 5 MHz respectively. Furthermore a
number of RRM requirements are defined under certain side conditions or signal
levels e.g. SCH Ec/Io, CPICH Ec/Io, CPICH RSCP, Io levels etc.
In time-dilated UMTS due to reduction in chip rate for bandwidths smaller than
5 MHz the information will be sent over a time period longer than that used in
case of legacy UMTS (i.e. 5 MHz) assuming the spreading factor remains the
same. For example P-CPICH in time-dilated UMTS is sent using the existing
SF=256 but will be spread over time if the chip rate is reduced to 1.92 Mcps
for channel bandwidth of 2.5 MHz. For time-dilated UMTS, it is desirable to
keep the side conditions the same to ensure same coverage as in the legacy
UMTS. Impact on UE and Node B related RRM requirements due to introduction of
time-dilated UMTS is analyzed in the next sub clauses.
In order to verify the RRM core and performance requirements a number of test
cases are defined in the annex A of TS 25.133 and TS 36.133. Therefore any
impact on the RRM core or performance requirements will affect the
corresponding test cases defined in the annex A of TS 25.133 and annex A of TS
36.133. The RRM conformance tests in TS 34.121 and TS 36.521-3 are developed
by RAN5 based on RRM tests in the annex A of TS 25.133 and TS 36.133
respectively. Therefore any impact on the RRM core or performance requirements
will also affect RAN5 specifications TS 34.121 and TS 36.521-3.
##### 6.1.5.2.4.1 UE RRM requirements {#ue-rrm-requirements .H6}
Two major concerns were raised on time-dilated UMTS RRM performance:
\- L1 measurement period and corresponding measurement accuracy;
\- Additional signalling overhead wrt the time-dilated factor.
Both aspects have been extensively addressed in [10] and [11].
Based on one company\'s extensive simulation results, it was shown that almost
all UE RRM measurement requirements defined in TS 25.133 are not affected if
the measurements on time-dilated UMTS carrier are also time-dilated. The
exception was the measurement requirements in CELL_FACH state when HS-DSCH
discontinuous reception is ongoing with 2nd DRX. It should be noted that 2nd
DRX is an optional feature in Rel-11 and this impact may be eliminated by some
searcher optimization. The analysis assumed a natural time-dilated of
measurements compared to the legacy UMTS measurements implying potential
additional current consumption due to the increase in \"ON\" time for
measurements.
On the other hand, if the duration of each measurement on time-dilated UMTS
carrier is kept the same as the existing UMTS [12], [13], the following list
of UE RRM requirements defined in TS 25.133 may be expected to be affected if
measurement is done on time-dilated UMTS carrier. Due to lack of adequate
studies and analysis under this assumption, it will require detailed analysis
to confirm the impact.
\- Evaluation period in cell reselection:
\- Intra-frequency case in idle, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states
\- Inter-frequency case in idle, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states
\- Cell identification delay related requirements:
\- Intra-frequency cell identification delay in CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH states
\- Inter-frequency cell identification delay in CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH states

\- CPICH RSCP and
\- CPICH Ec/No
\- System information acquisition for inter-RAT UTRA FDD CSG cell
##### 6.1.5.2.4.2 BS RRM requirements {#bs-rrm-requirements .H6}
Similarly to UE RRM requirements impact, it is expected that NodeB RRM
measurement requirements defined in TS 25.133 are not affected if the
measurements on time-dilated UMTS carrier are also time-dilated. This implies
potential additional current consumption due to the increase in ON time for
measurements.
On the other hand, if the duration of each measurement on time-dilated UMTS
carrier is kept the same as the existing UMTS, a number of base station
related RRM measurement requirements defined in TS 25.133 is expected to be
affected for measurements on time-dilated UMTS carrier. These measurement
requirements are defined in terms of physical layer measurement period and
corresponding accuracy to be met under certain side conditions.\ The BS
measurement related requirements potentially to be affected are:
\- Received total wideband power
\- SIR
\- Transmitted carrier power
\- Transmitted code power
\- Round trip time
\- UTRAN GPS Timing of Cell Frames for UE positioning
\- SFN-SFN time difference
\- Transmitted carrier power of all codes not used for HS-PDSCH, HS-SCCH,
E-AGCH, E-RGCH or E-HICH transmission
\- DL Transmission Branch Load
\- Received Scheduled E-DCH Power Share (RSEPS)
Due to lack of adequate studies and analysis under this assumption, it will
require detailed analysis to confirm the impact.
##### 6.1.5.2.4.3 Additional observation related to RRM {#additional-
observation-related-to-rrm .H6}
For the signalling overhead wrt the time-dilated factor, an efficient
signalling mechanism could be designed for the communication of the Scalable
UMTS time-dilated factor N, where N is equal to 2 or 4 for Scalable UMTS N=2
and Scalable UMTS N=4, respectively. For example, a signalling mechanism has
been proposed in [11]. Hence a Scalable UMTS carrier becomes nothing but an
inter frequency in a different band from an existing RAT perspective. As a
result, the work required for introducing additional band can be expected to
happen in standards to introduce Scalable UMTS in certain bands.
A time-dilated UMTS capable UE will have to perform blind search of the chip
rate used on UMTS carriers searched during an initial cell search procedure
aka frequency search or band scanning. However, it should be noted that this
is similar to have additional band scanning for a multi-band capable UE
compared to a single-band capable UE.\ For example, if the UE supports legacy
UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2 in the same band, the complexity of band
scanning would be similar to the case when the UE supports legacy UMTS in two
different bands.
#### 6.1.5.3 Impact to GERAN1 specifications and coexistence
Void.
#### 6.1.5.4 Impact to RAN3 specifications
Different NodeBs may not support the same chip rates. Furthermore, there will
also be mixture of legacy NodeB and new NodeB capable of additional chip
rate(s) operating in the same coverage area. In order for the RNC to
communicate chip rates on different cells or carriers to the UE for
measurements, the RNC will have to acquire the NodeBs capability of supporting
different chip rates and also the currently used chip rate in the NodeBs. This
may also affect signalling and procedures defined in RAN3 specifications
covering NBAP, Iur, and Iu; e.g. TS 25.433, TS 25.423, TS 25.434, TS 25.435
etc. Therefore we foresee implication of time-dilated solution also on the
procedures defined in RAN3.
\- It is foreseen that the RNC needs to communicate chip rates on different
cells or carriers to the UE for measurements. Therefore the RNC also needs to
acquire the NodeB\'s capability of supporting different chip rates and also
the currently used chip rate used by different NodeBs, which are included in
the neighbour cell list signalled to the UE for measurements.
\- Capability signalling (impact AUDIT RESPONSE message);
\- SRNC needs to find out the time-dilated UMTS related parameters (e.g. chip
rate, ...) for external cells.
\- The \"Neighbouring UMTS Cell Information\" IE needs be modified to contain
time-dilated UMTS information.
\- The INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION REQUEST message which can be used by
one RNC to request another RNC to provide information about indicated cells.
\- The Requested Data Value IE or the ANR Cell Information IE in the Requested
Data Value IE in the INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION RESPONSE message needs be
updated to allow inclusion of time-dilated UMTS information for the requested
cells.
\- Potential need to update the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION.
#### 6.1.5.5 Impact to RAN5 specifications
For all impact on L1, L2, L3 and RF/RRM, this will spread to the RAN5 test
cases to:
1) provide test coverage for time-dilated UMTS aspects; and
2) to create variants or update existing test cases that do not specifically
verifies time-dilated UMTS to be able to be run on UEs supporting time-dilated
UMTS.
NOTE: One cannot just insert a scaling factor of \"N\" everywhere. E.g. TS
34.108 needs to be updated with all new bearer combinations that are needed.
New tests specific to time-dilated UMTS would be introduced, but also a number
of basic or legacy tests will not work.\ Hence, there is a need to redefine
all tests for any core/performance requirements which would be affected by
time dilation solution. For instance, with introduction of MIMO, one does not
have to add new tests for legacy requirements, like cell reselection,
measurement accuracy, cell search, etc. For time-dilated UMTS, there might be
a need to redefine lots of basic tests for each new chip rate introduced (I.e.
even those tests which were developed in R99).\ A particular challenge arises
in TS 34.108 if absolute bit rate should be kept same with time-dilated UMTS
solution. Doing 12.2 kbps AMR requires new RB mapping since one needs to have
one AMR frame per 20 ms (UMTS: 2 radio frames, time-dilated UMTS: 1 radio
frame). Also, SRB 3.4 kbps is low already today, reducing that to 1.7 kbps is
not good, hence new mappings of SRB are needed. Thus, there might be a need to
create variants for a number of prioritized DCH RB combinations. Any impact on
the RRM core or performance requirements will affect the corresponding test
cases defined in the annex A of TS 25.133 and annex A of TS 36.133. For
example, if cell identification delay is extended for lower chip rate, then
test requirements in the tests verifying such requirements will have to be
modified. For example, test times that are tailored for the test requirements
(e.g. delay/measurement period) need to be modified, new reference measurement
channels to be defined and new parameters like chip rate, bandwidth, etc.,
will have to be included. For clarity, a good approach would be to redefine a
new set of test cases for all lower chip rates. This will however heavily
affect RAN5 conformance testing.
Impacted specifications are:
\- TS 34.108 (common test environment, default messages, radio bearer
definitions);
\- TS 34.121-1 (RF/RRM test cases);
\- TS 34.121-2 (Applicability, Implementation Conformance Statements (ICS) for
RF/RRM test cases);
\- TS 34.123-1 (Protocol test cases);
\- TS 34.123-2 (Applicability, Implementation Conformance Statements (ICS) for
protocol test cases);
\- TS 34.123-3 (TTCN test model for time-dilated UMTS solution).
### 6.1.6 Impacts on coexistence
According to an LS sent by RAN1, the following scenarios are possible for
time-dilated UMTS deployment:

In RAN4 #67 it was decided to investigate the following area:
\- NodeB transmitter characteristics against the existing TS 25.104
(Standalone) and\ TS 37.104 (Multi-carrier)
\- Metric: ACLR, UEM
\- Scenarios: Multi-carrier and Standalone
\- UE transmitter characteristics against the existing TS 25.101
\- Metric: ACLR, SEM
\- Scenarios: Standalone
\- NodeB receiver blocking compared to the existing TS 25.104 (Standalone)
and\ TS 37.104 (Multi-carrier)

\- Metric
\- Band I: ACS and in-band blocking
\- Band VIII: ACS, in-band blocking and narrow band blocking
\- Scenarios: Multi-carrier and Standalone
**Under the following assumptions**
\- PSD: Same PSD, Same Power, Other PSD
\- PA for multi-carrier BS: A common PA, separate PAs
\- BS: Wide area BS
\- Multi-carrier BW assumption
\- Nominal spacing
\- 6 MHz
\- Note that the following assumptions are considered in RAN1 for the
analysis:
\- The distance from the center carrier frequency to the band edge should be
at least 2.5 MHz for legacy UMTS carriers and 2.5/N MHz for 5/N MHz scalable
UMTS carriers.
\- A 5 MHz nominal bandwidth shall be considered for legacy UMTS
\- For the 3.84/N Mcps carrier, a 5/N MHz bandwidth is assumed. The carrier
separation depends on the specific scenario.
#### 6.1.6.1 BS transmitter characteristics
ACLR and SEM are two requirements which limit the interference level to
adjacent systems. RAN4 has conducted initial evaluation considering current
UMTS SEM and ACLR requirement for time-dilated UMTS carrier.\ The following
observations were made:
\- As the bandwidth decrease, the margin between signal spectrum and UMTS mask
at the bandwidth edge also decrease;
\- The margin between spectrum and UMTS mask at the bandwidth edge is smaller
for the same power case than that for the same PSD case;
\- For FCC regulatory requirement, -13dBm requirements shall be fulfilled in
narrower bandwidth.
In addition, several options of spectrum emission mask for time-dilated UMTS
are also discussed [4][5][6]:
**Option 1: UMTS mask**
\- One company's results show that UMTS mask (without additional offset) can
be met [4][5]. However, UMTS mask feasibility for time-dilated UMTS as minimum
requirements requires further study.
**Option 2: MSR BC2 mask applied for all the bands**
\- It is feasible to meet MSR BC2 mask defined in TS 37.104 for time-dilated
UMTS for all the bands.
**Option 3: Follow MSR specification (as done for LTE with narrow carrier),**
i.e. BC1 mask for BC1 bands such as band I and BC2 mask for BC2 bands such as
band VIII
\- It is feasible to meet MSR BC1 mask for BC1 bands time-dilated UMTS and BC2
mask for BC2 bands time-dilated UMTS
\- According to BC1 mask defined in 37.104 the requirements for receiver and
transmitter shall apply with a frequency offset from the lowest and highest
carriers to the RF bandwidth edges (F~offset,\ RAT~) equal to BW~Channel~/2 +
200 kHz . This implies that the distance from the center carrier frequency to
the band edge should be at least 2.5/N MHz +200 kHz for 5/N MHz time-dilated
UMTS carriers. Additional offset introduced by this mask may have implication
on the multi-carrier scenarios agreed in RAN1. It may or may not affect
conclusions in RAN1 study for the multi-carrier scenario.
**Option 4: MSR BC1 mask for all the bands**
\- It is feasible to meet MSR BC1 mask for time-dilated UMTS. Same comments as
for option 3 apply.
For ACLR requirement, based on one company's measurement results [4], we have
observations as below:
\- Time-dilated UMTS (same PSD or same power) has comparable ACLR toward UMTS
and time-dilated UMTS systems when compared to UMTS.
\- UMTS has comparable ACLR toward time-dilated UMTS systems when compared to
UMTS to UMTS ACLR.
#### 6.1.6.2 BS receiver characteristics
From BS receiver side, legacy UMTS/LTE BS receiver performance such as ACS and
in-band blocking requirements should be investigated in presence of time-
dilated UMTS interference because of the closer interference frequency offset
from the RF bandwidth edge and possible higher interference PSD level. It may
cause additional interference to the receiver and impact performance of
existing receivers of those in-field BS as currently there is no requirement
to satisfy rejection of signal with such parameters.
{width="3.0180555555555557in"
height="2.563888888888889in"}{width="3.5701388888888888in"
height="2.5868055555555554in"}
Figure 6.1.6.2-1 Minimum offset of adjacent channel signal for 2.5 MHz
scalable UMTS
Based on the analysis from two companies [8][14], in the current
specifications, the narrow band blocking requirement is more stringent than
the ACS requirement with interference of time-dilated UMTS carrier. The narrow
band blocking interference with GMSK modulated signal has higher interfering
power, narrower interfering bandwidth and closer frequency offset compared
with adjacent time-dilated UMTS interference, but shares the same sensitivity
degradation with current ACS requirement (6 dB desensitisation). From this
point of view, for the BS in the band which has narrow band blocking
requirement like Band VIII, the impact of introducing time-dilated UMTS
carrier would be further reduced because of the stricter design to resist
narrow band blocking interference. For the band which has no narrow band
blocking requirement, further analysis needs to be done, for example for Band
I. Another issues might be connected with existing blocking performance as
currently there are no requirements to satisfy rejection of -40 dBm
interfering signal with the offset of 3.75 MHz for N=2 and 1.875 MHz for N=4
(see Figure 6.1.6.2-1).
Based on the test results on some commercial BS provided by one company [7],
it is shown that time-dilated UMTS interfering signal affects legacy BS
receiver in a similar way as the legacy UMTS interferer, regardless of whether
the time-dilated UMTS interfering signal has the same power or the same PSD as
the legacy UMTS interfering signal.\ The same conclusion is expected to be
valid for LTE and GSM.
#### 6.1.6.3 UE transmitter characteristics
One company has provided analysis on coexistence in [15, 16] against the
existing TS 25.101 requirements.
From the analysis provided in [15, 16] the following observations can be done:
\- For occupied bandwidth: Measurements in [16] show that the requirements for
time-dilated UMTS occupied bandwidth is consistent with UMTS/N
\- SEM: One company observation is that measurements in [16] and simulation
results in [15] show that UMTS mask can be met without additional offset. As
the bandwidth decrease, the margin between signal spectrum and UMTS mask at
the bandwidth edge also decrease;
\- The margin between spectrum and UMTS mask at the bandwidth edge is smaller
for the same power case than that for the same PSD case;
\- UMTS mask feasibility for time-dilated UMTS as minimum requirements
requires further study.
\- ACLR values are comparable to those obtained with legacy UMTS carrier for
the first adjacent carrier.\ The legacy UMTS cannot maintain the performance
of legacy alternate channel rejection ratio if the first and second adjacent
carriers are time-dilated UMTS carriers.
#### 6.1.6.4 UE receiver characteristics
One company has provided analysis on UE rx requirements related to coexistence
against the existing TS 25.101 requirements. The following observations are
derived from the results shown in [17] by one company, they may not represent
averaged results across the companies in RAN4.
From the analysis provided in [17] the following observations can be done:
\- Time-dilated UMTS UE shows degraded margins wrt to REFSENS compared to
legacy UMTS UE.
\- For ACS when a time-dilated UMTS jammer (with same power offset as in
legacy test) interferes with a legacy UMTS victim, an increased margin is
observed compared with legacy UMTS reception in presence of legacy UMTS
jammer.
\- When the jammer level is decreased (such that the PSD of time-dilated UMTS
jammer is same as the PSD of the UMTS jammer) an increased margin is observed.
\- ACS for legacy UMTS carrier in presence of N time-dilated interference has
not be addressed.
\- Time-dilated UMTS (N=2) receiver has decreased margin compared to an UMTS
receiver in presence of a UMTS jammer.
\- For in-band scenarios, comparable performance was observed for time-dilated
UMTS receiver performance.
\- time-dilated UMTS receiver shows comparable results for narrowband blocking
compared to legacy UMTS carrier
\- The observation above is applicable for multi-carrier scenarios when the
nominal spacing is maintained.\ If the multi-carrier scenarios as described in
the above clauses are introduced as such into the specification, further study
is needed.

##### 6.1.7.1.1 Example: web page download user plane latency over Uu
interface
The median Web page sizes used in this analysis are ≈ 150 kbyte to 1500 kbyte.
Assuming that there are 1500 byte per IP packet, this translates into ≈ 100 to
1000 IP packets per Web page.
An estimate of the Web page download user plane latency over the Uu interface
is shown in Table 6.1.7.1.1-1 for normal UMTS and the time-dilated UMTS. Two
cases are analyzed:
\- Case A: 100 IP packets per Web page;
\- Case B: 1000 IP packets per Web page.
The Web page download user plane latency over the Uu interface
(_Web_page~latency_Uu~_) was estimated as a function of the number of MAC PDUs
per IP packet (_MAC_PDU~IP~_).
Not captured in Table 6.1.7.1.1-1 is the fact that the request-response nature
of HTTP leads to multiple round trips being required to retrieve objects such
as an image, JavaScript, CCS file, etc., where the median number of objects
per Web page is ≈ 13 for a 150 kbyte Web page and ≈ 95 for a 1500 kbyte Web
page. During this time the Uu interface may be under-utilized. This, coupled
with Web browser processing delays and server load, leads to Web browsing
delays saturating once the channel rate is sufficiently high (i.e., when the
number of MAC PDUs per IP packet is small).

normal UMTS and time-dilated UMTS N=2.\ In the test lab setup, the two main
parameters that were controlled were channel type and cell geometry. Fading
was introduced using a channel emulator. Geometry was controlled using a

Figure 6.1.7.1.2-2, Figure 6.1.7.1.2-3 and Figure 6.1.7.1.2-4 show the Web
page download times for an AWGN, PA3 and VA30 channel, respectively.
For low cell geometries (0 dB), the Amazon Web page download time for time-
dilated UMTS N=2 is approximately double that for normal UMTS. At higher cell
geometries (5 and 10 dB), the Amazon Web page download time for time-dilated
UMTS N=2 is approximately 30% longer than that for normal UMTS. At very high
cell geometries (20 dB), the Amazon Web page download times for time-dilated
UMTS N=2 and normal UMTS are similar.
Note that the request-response nature of HTTP leads to multiple round trips
being required to retrieve objects such as an image, JavaScript, CCS file,
etc. During this time the Uu interface may be under-utilized. This, coupled
with Web browser processing delays and server load, leads to Web browsing
delays saturating once the channel rate is sufficiently high (i.e. very high
cell geometries).

##### 6.1.7.2.1 Uplink user plane latency mitigation techniques
When the PSD of time-dilated UMTS is scaled by a factor N (as shown in Figure
6.1.7.2.1-1) then the extra power available for time-dilated UMTS can be used
to overcome data rate and/or latency impacts and achieve a performance that is
comparable to normal UMTS. The extra power may be applied in this manner when
the UL is not interference limited; in other words, it may be applied within
the UL RoT budget. In what follows, two cases for latency are analyzed. In one
case, referred to as the \"same rate\" case, the extra power is used to make
the time-dilated UMTS data rate be the same as normal UMTS. In the second
case, referred to as the \"reduced rate\" case, the extra power in time-
dilated UMTS is used to overcome the latency impact of HARQ at the cost of
reduced data rate (reduced by a factor of 1/N) relative to normal UMTS. It
should be noted that these mitigation techniques would have a corresponding
impact on capacity due to the reduced rate since additional RoT would be
required.
Figure 6.1.7.2.1-1: Time-Dilated UMTS PSD scaled by N relative to normal UMTS\
(i.e. Time-Dilated UMTS transmit power same as normal UMTS)
Table 6.1.7.2.1-1 lists the user plane latency impact due to HARQ for the
\"same rate\" case. Here we assume a target of 10% BLER after 1^st^
transmission and a maximum of 2 transmissions.

Table 6.1.7.2.1-2 lists the user plane latency impact due to HARQ for the
\"reduced rate\" case, where the extra power available for time-dilated UMTS
is used to increase the probability that only a single HARQ transmission is
required relative to normal UMTS. Here we assume a target of 10% BLER after
1^st^ transmission and a maximum of 2 transmissions for normal UMTS and a
single transmission for time-dilated UMTS.

#### 6.1.7.3 User plane latency analysis in CELL_FACH state
The main impact of time-dilated UMTS on CELL_FACH is on latency. The
functional operation in CELL_FACH in time-dilated UMTS is the same as that for
UMTS. An analysis of the latency in CELL_FACH is provided in the following
subclauses. It should be noted that the UE power consumption in CELL_FACH
would be higher in time-dilated UMTS as compared with UMTS even when DRX in
CELL_FACH is used. This is due to the longer transmission times required in
time-dilated UMTS.
##### 6.1.7.3.1 Uplink
##### 6.1.7.3.1.1 RACH {#rach .H6}
The user-plane latency in case of uplink transmissions on RACH is introduced
from the physical random access preamble ramping procedure and the
transmission of the data message part i.e. TTI duration.
Since the latency aspects related to the reading of the SIB have been dealt
with in RAN2, we focus on the other aspects that contribute to the latency.
Table 6.1.7.3.1.1-1 provides an estimate of the average latency values. It is
assumed that 4 preambles per preamble ramping cycle and 1 preamble cycle are
needed during the Random Access procedure.

##### 6.1.7.3.1.2 Common E-DCH {#common-e-dch .H6}
Common E-DCH utilizes E-DPDCH/E-DPCCH physical channels for uplink
transmissions in CELL_FACH state.\ With Common E-DCH, it can be assumed that
the UE is not required to read SIB7 since the UE will likely be camping in
CELL_FACH state thus having an up to date value (of SIB7) already. Also, if
the IE \"UL interference\" is included in SIB5/5bis, the UE is not required to
read SIB7. The access procedure and the message part still contribute to the
latency. Two other sources of latency need to be considered for this case:
\- Latency due to pilot (DPCCH) only transmission duration i.e. DPCCH
preamble;
\- Latency due to interlace structure of HARQ.
The resources needed for control signalling for time-dilated UMTS is the same
as for UMTS despite supporting half the number of users.
Table 6.1.7.3.1.2-1 lists the user plane delay impact for the message part of
Common E-DCH.

for time dilation) to achieve synchronization at the Node-B, i.e. the number
of chips of DPCCH only transmission remains the same between UMTS and time-
dilated UMTS. Due to the excess energy accumulated over given amount of time
in time-dilated UMTS, the duration of the DPCCH only preamble (configured in
SIB5/5bis/22) could be reduced from that listed in Table 6.1.7.3.1.2-2 for
time-dilated UMTS.

##### 6.1.7.3.2 Downlink
##### 6.1.7.3.2.1 FACH {#fach .H6}
For FACH transport channel, SCCPCH is used at the physical layer for downlink
transmissions to the UE in CELL_FACH state. Unlike the uplink, there are no
delays associated with SIB acquisition or preamble ramping to transmit data to
the UE in the downlink in CELL_FACH. The excess latency introduced in the
user-plane is due to the actual transmission duration, i.e. the SCCPCH TTI
elongation. In UMTS, the SCCPCH TTI is 10 ms which would get elongated to 20
ms and 40 ms for time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4 cases. This is captured in
Table 6.1.7.3.2.1-1 below.

elongation, the HARQ structure would add to the user-plane latency in time-
dilated UMTS compared to UMTS.

The median e-mail size used in this analysis is ≈ 150 kbyte. Assuming that
there are 1500 byte per IP packet, this translates into ≈ 100 IP packets per
e-mail.
An estimate of the e-mail download user plane latency over the Uu interface is
shown in Table 6.1.7.3.2.3-1 for normal UMTS and the time-dilated UMTS.
The e-mail download user plane latency over the Uu interface
(_Web_page~latency_Uu~_) was estimated as a function of the number of MAC PDUs

### 6.1.8 Impact on mobility (idle mode and connected mode)
#### 6.1.8.1 Carrier identification and UE capability
Time-dilated carriers with N=2 or N=4 of the bandwidth of a normal carrier
need to be distinguished from each other and from the normal carrier that has
the same centre frequency. This means the same UARFCN alone cannot be used for
all cases. The same issues apply to UE capability signalling. For various
inter-frequency and inter-RAT procedures and measurement setups, the network
needs to know if a UE supports a certain time-dilated carrier.
The RAN2 solution depends on what RAN4 agrees with regards carrier
identification. The complexity of this solution may, hence, also depend on the
RAN4 solution. Some solutions have been submitted but not yet discussed in
RAN2. The impact on RAN2 work depends on the solution(s), once the concrete
solution(s) are known better, a more detailed evaluation of the impacts can be
performed.
#### 6.1.8.2 Inter-frequency mobility
Introduction of time-dilated UMTS carriers will impact mobility procedures
where there is a need to handover the UE to carriers with different bandwidth.
For example:
\- Inter-frequency handover within the same frequency band, or to another
frequency band;
\- IRAT Handover to UTRAN from LTE/GSM;
\- RRC Connection Reject with redirection to other frequency;
\- RRC Connection Release with redirection to other frequency.
For all these use-cases there is a need to provide additional information so
that the UE is able to identify the target carrier. For example, if the same
frequency band contains both time-dilated and normal UMTS carriers proper
signalling indication must be included in all RRC messages that can be used to
execute the mobility procedures. In addition, neighbour cell information in
NBAP / RNSAP Radio Link Addition/Setup Response / Failure also needs to be
extended with information to identify the time-dilated UMTS carrier. There
could also be a signalling impact on the corresponding LTE and GERAN
specifications in order to support a handover or a redirection to a time-
dilated UMTS carrier
To avoid the situation whereas the RNC might redirect the UE to a carrier
using a non-supported bandwidth, the UE needs to provide information about
supported bandwidths already in the RRC Connection Request message. However,
the size of RRC connection request is a limiting factor and the needs for its
extension should be evaluated
#### 6.1.8.3 Impact on Cell Selection and Cell Reselection
The time it takes to detect and evaluate the serving cell and neighbouring
cells listed in System Information are controlled by the measurement
requirements specified in TS 25.133.
Measurement requirements may increase the measurement periods for intra-
frequency and inter-frequency measurements performed in Idle mode, URA_PCH,
CELL_PCH and CELL_FACH states. For a time-dilated UMTS carrier both the DRX
cycle as well as the FACH measurement occasion cycle may increase by a factor
of N (this is pending on RAN4 analysis).
Longer measurement periods will impact the cell reselection performance.
#### 6.1.8.4 Positioning
Impact on Positioning should also be evaluated to make sure that countries and
regulators requirements are fulfilled.
#### 6.1.8.5 Other mobility aspects
##### 6.1.8.5.1 RL failure or RLC unrecoverable error
Assuming a longer SRB latency, there will be an increased risk to detect Radio
link failure and RLC unrecoverable error procedures for time-dilated UMTS Upon
detection of a RL failure or RLC unrecoverable error, the UE can move to state
CELL_FACH and initiate the Cell Update procedure in order to try to recover.
When this happens, there is an interruption time which can be broken down in:
\- time to find a suitable cell;
\- time to acquire system information in case no stored information is
available for the selected cell;
\- transmission of cell update and reception of cell update confirm;
\- synchronization procedure.
For time-dilated UMTS all these components will take longer time and, hence,
the total interrupt time may increase.
### 6.1.9 Impact on SIBs acquisition
If no latency mitigation techniques are used, the BCH user data rate is scaled
by 1/N relative to normal UMTS.\ This impacts SIBs acquisition time (e.g.
assuming a SIB repetition period of 1.28 s, for N=2 the total SIB acquisition
time is estimated to be at least 2.56 s and for N=4 it will take 5.12 s for
the UE to read all the SIBs).\ Longer acquisition time will impact, for
example, cell reselection and CS Fallback from LTE (CSFB).
Some solutions have been submitted but not yet discussed in RAN2. For example,
the following latency mitigation techniques may be used: (1) optimized SIB
structure and/or scheduling mechanism; (2) multiple PCCPCH mechanism or single
PCCPCH mechanism with SF scaled by 1/N; (3) limit the features which time-
dilated UMTS can be configured for.
Feasibility of (1) may depend on if and how much the repetition periods can be
optimized, whilst (2) would have an impact of the overall control channel
overhead as the existing power and code spent on P-CCPCH needs to be
multiplied by a factor of N. New radio configurations for the P-CCPCH would
also need to be defined. RAN2 has not evaluated the above solutions.
### 6.1.10 Impact on signalling and user plane data
#### 6.1.10.1 SRB performance
The impact on latency for time-dilated UMTS has been analysed for a few
example use-cases.
Only the Uu signalling delay (including TTI alignment) is considered in the
analysis.\ It is assumed that the NBAP/RNSAP and RANAP signalling delay and
also the processing times in the UE, RBS, RNC and CN will be the same in both
the UMTS and the time-dilated UMTS scenario.
With a scaling factor of N=2 and a minimum radio frame of 20 ms the signalling
time will be doubled.
##### 6.1.10.1.1 Call setup delay for speech AMR NB MM multi-rate
12.2/7.4/5.9/4.95 from idle
For this use case, a stand-alone signalling bearer of 13.6 kbps and TTI 10 ms
(TS 34.108, subclause 6.10.2.4.1.3) is established for the initial signalling.
In order to improve the UL coverage and DL capacity a multi-mode multi-rate
AMR NB speech configuration is likely to be used in a time-dilated UMTS
system. When the speech radio bearers are established the SRB is reconfigured
to 3.4 kbps with a TTI of 40 ms (TS 34.108, subclause 6.10.2.4.1.4a).
The speech call setup sequence can be broken down in the following RRC
signalling:

For scenarios where the complete System Information needs to be read, the
speech call setup time will increase even more
If no solution is adopted, SRB latency would be, logically, scaled up by N.
Some solutions have been submitted but not discussed in RAN2. For example, one
option could be to scale SRBs\' SF by 1/N (or using additional available
power, for the SRBoHS case, by scaling the Scalable UMTS Power Spectral
Density). Changing SF may require introducing new radio bearer configurations.
RAN2 has not evaluated the above solutions.
It is proposed that solutions for reducing the long speech setup delay for
time-dilated UMTS are studied together with consequences for each solution. In
specific in relation to emergency calls the increased delay of establishing a
speech call needs to be mitigated.
#### 6.1.10.2 User plane performance
The detailed impacts of time-dilated carriers on user-plane performance have
not yet been studied.\ The expected impacts are:
\- Peak Rate: Decrease in peak rate by the same factor as the time-dilation.
\- Data Rate and Latency:
\- For PS/data traffic, when the PSD of the Scalable UMTS time-dilated
solution is the same as normal UMTS, then the Scalable UMTS data rate and
latency are scaled accordingly (i.e., by a factor of 1/N for data rate and N
for latency, assuming that the number of UEs served by Scalable UMTS and
normal UMTS are the same). This increase in latency could have an impact on
TCP performance.
\- However, some solutions to address these issues have been presented in RAN2
but not discussed or evaluated.
\- If the spreading factor of the BCCH and other DL control channels are
reduced proportionally maintain the same bitrate for performance reason, the
number of codes available for HS transmissions may be reduced, which would
impact the maximum DL bitrate.
#### 6.1.10.3 New radio configurations
For a time-dilated UMTS system where the radio frames are scaled by a factor
N=2 or N=4, there is a need to use other radio bearer configurations than
those that are specified in TS 34.108 and TR 25.993.
### 6.1.11 Impact on MAC, RLC and RRC performance, including impact on timers
and procedures
**RLC impact**

## 6.2 Time-dilated solution for Carrier Aggregation scenarios
### 6.2.1 Solutions for Carrier Aggregation scenarios
#### 6.2.1.1 Timing relation of HS-PDSCHs and HS-DPCCHs
Assuming the CPICHs (also HS-SCCHs) of both legacy primary carrier and the
small bandwidth secondary carrier are time aligned, the timing relation of HS-
PDSCHs is shown in Figure 6.2.1.1-1. The start of any subframe of the small
bandwidth carrier with N=2 begins 4/3 ms after the start of the nearest
subframe of the legacy carrier; and the start of any subframe of the small
bandwidth carrier with N=4 is aligned with the start of one subframe of legacy
carrier.
Figure 6.2.1.1-1: Timing relation of HS-PDSCHs
Assuming the timing between HS-PDSCH and HS-DPCCH is kept as Rel-5
(approximately 7.5 slots) in the cell where HS-PDSCH belongs to, the timing of
HS-DPCCH for legacy carriers and small bandwidth carriers will be not aligned
any more. The timing relation is shown in Figure 6.2.1.1-2.
Figure 6.2.1.1-2: Timing relation of HS-DPCCHs
#### 6.2.1.2 HS-DPCCH solutions
For CA of a legacy UMTS carrier with a time-dilated UMTS carrier, both single
and dual code design solutions can be considered.
**Solutions of HS-DPCCH design**
\- Solution 1: Single HS-DPCCH with joint encoding for ACK and TDM for CQI of
carriers;
\- Solution 2: Dual HS-DPCCHs with each corresponding to one downlink carrier.
**The illustration of Solution 1 is shown in** Figure 6.2.1.2-1 **and** Figure
6.2.1.2-2 **for scaling factor N=2.\ In Solution 1 joint encoding for ACK and
TDM for CQI is adopted and time adjustment is used to follow the timing based
on legacy UMTS feedback occasions. The exact time adjustment for ACK or CQI
can be further studied.**

different HS-DPCCH timings in different carriers, wherein for each cell legacy
HS-DPCCH feedback delay (approximately 7.5 slots is kept.)

#### 6.2.2.2 System simulation results for Carrier Aggregation of time-dilated
UMTS with UMTS
In the multicarrier case, multicarrier users can benefit from increased
throughput; the extent of the benefit depends on the bandwidth and the
penetration level of multicarrier users.
The bursty traffic UEs are modelled by the parameters given in simulation
assumptions in subclause 6.3.1.\ The same assumptions are applied to both
carriers, with the exception of control channels on the second carrier where
it was assumed that only P-CPICH is transmitted. The time dilation factor on
the first carrier is always N =1 and the factor on the second carrier is N = 2
or N =4.
In the results for Carrier Aggregation shown below, all the UEs are assumed to
be capable of Carrier Aggregation. The system performance for lower
proportions of Carrier Aggregation UEs has not been evaluated.
{width="5.375in" height="3.747916666666667in"}
Figure 6.2.2.2-1: Average UE burst rate
In Figure 6.2.2.2-1, the average burst rate of the UEs is presented for
different scenarios. From the figure it is observed that for total K UEs in
single carrier case if the average burst rate is R, the dual carrier with N =
2 on the second carrier and with 1.5 K UEs has an average burst rate of
approximately 1.5 R. Also, the dual carrier with N = 4 on the second carrier
and with 1.25 K UEs has an average burst rate of approximately 1.25 R. To
explain this observation, notice that the dual carrier system of Time Dilation
factor N on the second carrier with (1+1/N)K UEs is observing a load that is
(1+1/N) times the load observed by the single carrier system with K UEs.
Furthermore, the service rate of the dual carrier system is (1+1/N) times the
service rate of the single carrier system as the available bandwidth is scaled
by (1+1/N). As a result, based on the queuing theory, the burst rate of the
dual carrier system is (1+1/N) times the burst rate of the single carrier
system. For a more direct comparison of different time-dilated UMTS systems
the effective number UEs/Sector is defined as K for single carrier system and
(1+1/N) K for the dual carrier system.
Table 6.2.2.2-1 present the average, 5%, and 50% tail value of the UEs burst
rate and shows that similar ratios hold for the tail values of the burst rate.

Finally, the following plots present the CDF of the UEs burst rate for

similar proportion holds between burst rate of different time-dilated UMTS
systems across different tail values.

##### 6.2.2.2.1 Inter-carrier leakage
For time-dilated UMTS multiple-carrier scenarios, depending on the size of the
spectrum block and case, there is a risk for Inter Carrier Leakage (ICL)
between the UMTS and the time-dilated UMTS carriers assuming that the offset
towards the edge of block is kept to the nominal value to avoid co-existence
issues with adjacent uncoordinated operating networks.
The ICL is a combined effect of transmitter unwanted emissions, Adjacent
Carrier Leakage Ratio (ACLR) and limited selectivity in the receiver, Adjacent
Channel Selectivity (ACS). Figure 6.2.2.2.1-1 gives an example of DL ICL,
where the BS time-dilated UMTS emissions in form of ACLR as well as
selectivity of the UMTS UE would contribute to ICL on the UMTS carrier in DL.
The level of ICL in a multiple-carrier scenario will depend on the level of
separation/overlap between the UMTS and time-dilated UMTS carriers. Note that
in DL, the minimum specified value for BS ACLR is 45 dB, while the UE ACS
value is 33 dB considering nominal spacing/separation between UMTS carriers.
{width="3.4854166666666666in" height="1.8083333333333333in"}
Figure 6.2.2.2.1-1: Mechanisms to calculate the ICL
The ICL is calculated as:
{width="1.413888888888889in" height="0.40069444444444446in"}
It is essential to consider both BS ACLR and UE ACS since ICL in DL would in
general be limited to UE selectivity and thus only considering the BS
transmitter ACLR as the only source to ICL would result in wrong and extremely
optimistic ICL which highly affects the conclusions.
The BS ACLR models are based on an extremely good radio transmitter
dimensioned for linearization of around 60 dBc. The corresponding UMTS ACLR
would be \~55 dB, which is 10 dB better than the required performance
according to existing RAN4 specifications. The same transmitter was used to
investigate the time-dilated UMTS carriers for both N=2 and N=4. The
transmitter characteristics and the emissions outside the carrier for UMTS
and\ time-dilated UMTS carriers are given in Figure 6.2.2.2.1-2.

Figure 6.2.2.2.1-2: UMTS and time-dilated UMTS transmitter characteristics
(blue)\ and UMTS spectrum emission mask (red)
The BS ACLR values for time-dilated UMTS carriers are based on measurement in
adjacent UMTS carrier and are given for 2.5 MHz and 1.25 MHz time-dilated UMTS
carriers respectively. Various centre-to-centre separations between UMTS and
time-dilated UMTS carriers are considered. A simple UE ACS model is given
below and similar to the BS ACLR models, the ACS values for the UMTS carrier
are based on the presence of a time-dilated UMTS carrier in the adjacent
channel. The UE ACS values are shown for various centre-to-centre separations
between UMTS and time-dilated UMTS carriers. The UMTS ACS value is \~50 dB,
which is significantly better than the standardized minimum value of 33 dB.
The ACS model does not, however, include possible improvements, such as,
employing advanced receivers (e.g. interference cancellation capable
receivers, Type 3i). Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the BS ACLR
and UE ACS models used for these simulations represent very good radios that
are significantly better than what is required by the RAN4 specifications, and
consequently the presented results are overly optimistic. Other companies are
encouraged to investigate the impact of using other radio impairment models to
derive the effective ICL.
Figures 6.2.2.2.1-3, 6.2.2.2.1-4 and 6.2.2.2.1-5 show the BS ACLR, UE ACS and
the effective DL ICL towards a victim UMTS carrier for different aggressor
bandwidth carriers as a function of victim and aggressor centre carrier
separation (frequency offset).

## 6.8 Scalable Bandwidth UMTS by Filtering
### 6.8.1 Description
The \"Scalable Bandwidth UMTS solution by Filtering\" comprises of using the
same BB processing and the typical 3.84 Mcps chip rate used in UMTS FDD
systems, and filtering the signal to fit to a channel bandwidth below 3.84
MHz. That is, the filtering is used to trade off signal quality and occupied
bandwidth.\ In the present document, this solution is referred to as
\"Scalable Bandwidth UMTS by Filtering\".
Figure 6.8.1-1 illustrates the concept, where the filtered UMTS pass-bandwidth
is narrower than the 3.84 Mcps signal. For illustration purposes 2.5 MHz
filter has been shown, but the filter pass bandwidth could be selected to best
fit a given deployment scenario.
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="2.298611111111111in"}
Figure 6.8.1-1: Normal and 2.5 MHz filtered UMTS waveforms
The \"Scalable Bandwidth UMTS solution by Filtering\" uses the UMTS FDD
physical layer specifications as is, with the only difference being the
transmit and receive filters.
### 6.8.2 Preliminary evaluation results on filtered UMTS motivating further
study
#### 6.8.2.1 Downlink link level results
NOTE: The following results were obtained during the first SI on scalable UMTS
bandwidths [3] as a motivation to consider pure and enhanced filtering
solutions further. These simulations differ from more realistic results in
their assumptions on P-CPICH overhead, SCH overhead, PICH overhead.
##### 6.8.2.1.1 HSDPA link analysis
The spectral efficiency comparison between regular UMTS (5.0 MHz deployment)
with the filtering solution (2.5 MHz) and time-dilation UMTS (2.5 MHz) is
given in Figures 6.8.2.1.1-1\~2.
From Figure 6.8.2.1.1-1, it can be observed that UMTS and time-dilation UMTS
have comparable spectral efficiencies. On the other hand, the filtering
solution has lower spectral efficiency that saturates at high geometry.\ This
can be attributed to the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) that results from the
filtering operation.\ Note that while there is a type 3i equalizer utilized,
it is still insufficient to combat the large ISI and spectral efficiency caps
below 1 bps/Hz/cell for PA3 channel. Other channels based on VA models
recorded even lower spectral efficiencies (0.6 bps/MHz/cell for VA 120
channel) owing to the fact that filtering-induced ISI is now compounded with
the channel induced ISI.
Results for 1.25 MHz bandwidth in Fig 6.8.2.1.1-2 re-iterate the same issue
with filtering solution, albeit in a stronger sense with lower spectral
efficiencies due to increased ISI compared to filtering solution (2.5 MHz).\
Note that in this setting, the RRC (1.25 MHz) has main-lobe that spans 4
symbols on the right and 4 symbols on the left.\ On the other hand, the main-
lobe spans 2 symbols on each side for RRC(2.5 MHz) whence the ISI is
relatively lower.

##### 6.8.2.1.2 DCH simulation results
Scalable UMTS with 2.5 MHz filtering is considered to be able to carry AMR
12.2 kbps DCH voice.\ In order to compare the performance of UMTS with
Filtering and the original UMTS, the following performance metrics are
computed as:
_\- UMTS with Filtering gain (UL) =(Rx Ec/No with UMTS) - (Rx Ec/No with UMTS
with Filtering -3dB)_
_\- UMTS with Filtering gain (DL) =(Tx Ec/Ior with UMTS) - (Tx Ec/Ior with
UMTS with Filtering -3dB)_

#### 6.8.2.2 Uplink link level results
The following results were obtained during the first SI on scalable UMTS
bandwidths [3] as a motivation to consider pure and enhanced filtering
solutions further. The results may differ from more realistic results in their
assumptions on the UL receiver type, HARQ operating point, code tree
utilisation, and number of parallel users.
##### 6.8.2.2.1 Uplink E-DCH performance of Scalable Bandwidth UMTS by
filtering in 2.5 MHz channel BW
Link simulation is performed for different E-DCH transport block sizes and
channel models with a 2.5 MHz filter that is achieved by halving the pass-band
of a nominal 5 MHz filter, i.e. the transmitted signal is a regular 3.84 Mcps
E-DCH signal with a filter that is narrower than the bandwidth of the signal
and no other filter optimizations have been introduced. The required received
C/I needed for 90% nominal throughput (e.g. for 1 Mbps instantaneous data
rate, 900 kbps data rate is achieved after HARQ) is logged for a given data
rate and power control is turned off.\ A dual-Rx Rake receiver was used.

Figure 6.8.2.2.1-1: Spectral efficiency of a filtered 2.5 MHz 3.84 Mcps E-DCH
link\ relative to 5 MHz link
A small link performance loss can be observed for low data rates. The loss
appears to increase as a function of data rate for other channels, but less so
for the PA3 channel. However, it should be noted that there was no attempt to
optimize the transmit filter or the receiver to the narrower bandwidth, so
drawing firm conclusions based on these results may be premature.
##### 6.8.2.2.2 Uplink E-DCH performance of Scalable Bandwidth UMTS by
filtering and zeroing every second chip in 2.5 MHz channel BW
Link simulation is performed for different E-DCH transport block sizes and
channel models with a 2.5 MHz filter that is achieved by halving the pass-band
of a nominal 5 MHz filter. In addition to this, every second chip is set to
zero in the transmitter. No other optimizations have been introduced. The
required received C/I needed for 90% nominal throughput (e.g. for 1 Mbps
instantaneous data rate, 900 kbps data rate is achieved after HARQ) is logged
for a given data rate and power control is turned off. A dual-Rx Rake was
used.

Figure 6.8.2.2.2-1: Spectral efficiency of a filtered 2.5 MHz 3.84 Mcps E-DCH
link\ with zeroing every second chip relative to 5 MHz link
The negative impacts of over-filtering have been largely mitigated by the
chip-zeroing. A small link performance loss can be observed for low to medium
data rates, and even 1 Mbps link performs well in a good channel, but more
significant loss can be observed in more difficult channel conditions.

Figure 6.8.2.2.2-2: Gain from setting every second chip to zero\ in a 3.84
Mcps signal and 2.5 MHz filter [dB]
Chip-zeroing does not provide any meaningful benefits for low rates. With
higher data rates, more loss is observed from filtering, and the chip zeroing
is mitigating this effect, and the negative impacts of over-filtering have
been largely mitigated by the chip-zeroing.
##### 6.8.2.2.3 EUL link analysis
This subclause presents EUL simulation results with regular UMTS (5.0 MHz
deployment) with the filtering solution (2.5 MHz) and time-dilation UMTS (2.5
MHz) and provides comparison between these two schemes in terms of throughput
and spectral efficiency. Table 6.8.2.2.3-1 shows the throughput for UMTS, time
dilation UMTS, and 2.5 MHz filtered UMTS. It is observed in Table 6.8.2.2.3-2
that the performance with UMTS and time-dilation UMTS are observed to be
comparable. On the other hand, the 2.5 MHz filtered UMTS inducing ICI has
spectral efficiency losses by 20-33% compared to UMTS as provided in Table
6.8.2.2.3-3. In these simulations, there is 10% target BLER setting after 1
HARQ with 2 ms TTI.

### 6.8.3 Impacts on the network and UE

Bandwidth UMTS solution by Filtering\".\ For reference Figure 6.1.4.1.1-2
illustrates an example of front-end implementation of standalone time-dilated
UMTS.
\- With filtered UMTS the analog Low Pass Filter (LPF) is now a narrower
bandwidth (e.g. 2.5 MHz) when compared to the baseline case (5 MHz bandwidth).
\- The ADC sampling rate does not change from the reference 5 MHz.

#### 6.8.3.2 UE transmitter
As with uplink of time-dilated UMTS, changing the system bandwidth for
Scalable Bandwidth UMTS by Filtering has impact to transmission filters and
possibly PA implementations depending on the maximum transmission power.
#### 6.8.3.3 BS receiver RF and digital front-end

Bandwidth UMTS solution by Filtering.\ For reference Figure 6.1.4.3.1-1
illustrates an example of front-end implementation of standalone time-dilated
UMTS.
Received Signal is filtered to the LPF after RF down-conversion and then is
sampled to generate digital signals (ADC) for the rest of the receiver chain,
i.e. carrier separation, pulse shaping filter and demodulation.

**Comparison:**

the example) for Scalable Bandwidth UMTS and 5 MHz bandwidth for baseline
UMTS.
\- The ADC sampling rate remains the same.
\- The pulse shaping filter handles a narrower bandwidth (2.5 MHz in the
example) for Scalable Bandwidth UMTS and 5 MHz bandwidth for baseline UMTS.
#### 6.8.3.4 BS transmitter RF and digital front-end
Similar to the same part of receiver, the Scalable Bandwidth UMTS by Filtering
requires a narrower bandwidth\ (e.g. 2.5 MHz) low pass filter, and narrower
bandwidth (e.g. 2.5 MHz) pulse shaping filter.
## 6.8A Scalable bandwidth UMTS by chip zeroing
### 6.8A.1 Description
The fundamental transmit waveform pulse used in CZ-UMTS is obtained by
dilating the UMTS RRC pulse shaping filter.
Let $r(t)$ denote the pulse shaping filter in UMTS of unit energy, i.e,
$\int_{}^{}{\left| r(t) \right|^{2}\text{dt}} = 1$. Then the pulse shaping
filter in CZ-UMTS is given by $r_{N}(t) = r(\frac{t}{N}\frac{)}{\sqrt{N}}$,
for _N_ = 2 or _N_ = 4. See Figure 6.8A.1. Note that for N=1, this becomes
identical to the UMTS pulse-shape, i.e., $r_{1}(t) = r(t)$, and also that
$r_{N}(t)$ is also of unit energy, i.e. , $\int_{}^{}{\left| r_{N}(t)
\right|^{2}\text{dt}} = 1$.

Figure 6.8A.1: Filtering CZ-UMTS pulse shaping filter, N = 2.
The block diagram in Figure 6.8A.2 show how the waveform of CZ-UMTS with
enhanced filtering is constructed. Notice that although the chip rate of CZ-
UMTS is the same as the UMTS, the mask 1,0,1,0 is used to zero out every
alternate chips prior to pulse shaping filter.

Figure 6.8A.2: CZ-UMTS with enhanced filtering (CZ-UMTS) waveform.
Due to zero-out mask, fundamentally CZ-UMTS waveform is similar to CZ-UMTS
based on time dilation when compared at chip level. However, the effective PSC
code sequences in CZ-UMTSand TD CZ-UMTS differ: TD CZ-UMTS effective PSC is
the same as UMTS, but CZ-UMTS _effective_ PSC is zeroed out every alternate
chips; see Figure 6.8A.3. Note that from implementation point of view, there
is no explicit need to define a new PSC sequence for CZ-UMTS system, and the
legacy PSC code can be reused as shown in block diagram of Figure 6.8A.2.

UMTS) and CZ-UMTS with enhanced filtering (CZ-UMTS)
### 6.8A.2 Power Spectrum Density and SINR analysis
Figure 6.8A.4 shows a frequency domain analysis of transmission and reception
of UMTS (bandwidth = W) and CZ-UMTS (bandwidth = W/N, where N=bandwidth
reduction factor). The new components in CZ-UMTS relative to UMTS are the
zero-out operations at transmitter and receiver (shown in the figure assuming
N=2), and the new narrow-band pulse-shaping. Note that the power-spectral
density (PSD) of a random process of the form $\sum_{n}^{}{c_{n}r(t -
\text{nT})}$, where $c_{n}$are random variables with zero mean and variance
$\text{Ec}$, is proportional to $\text{Ec}\frac{\left| R(f) \right|^{2}}{T}$,
where $R(f)$ is the continuous-time fourier-transform of $r(t)$. The CZ-UMTS
pulse-shape filter $r_{N}(t) = r(\frac{t}{N}\frac{)}{\sqrt{N}}$has fourier
transform $R_{N}(f) = R(\text{Nf})\sqrt{N}$. Based on this, as shown in Figure
6.8A.4, when the transmit pulse-shaping filters for both UMTS and SUMTS are
normalized to have unit energy, then the in-band PSD of both UMTS and CZ-UMTS
is the same if they both use the same energy per chip. The in-band heights of
$R(f)$ and the PSD are shown to be $\frac{1}{\sqrt{W}}$and $\text{Ec}$
respectively in Figure 6.8A.4, which assumes that $R(f)$ and the PSD have a
brick-wall shape. In reality these heights are slightly different because the
shape is not perfectly brick-wall but has a roll-off near the band-edge,
however this constant multiplying factor does not essentially change any of
the analysis, and is hence dropped for convenience.
At the receiver, the noise variance at the output of the energy-normalized
matched RRC filter is No for both UMTS and CZ-UMTS. The signal amplitude when
sampled at the peak, is obtained by integrating the product of the Tx and Rx
SRRC filter amplitude responses, and thus this is also the same for UMTS and
CZ-UMTS, i.e., equal to $\sqrt{\text{Ec}}$. Thus, the SNR for each UMTS chip
is the same as the SNR for each CZ-UMTS chip, namely Ec/No. However, unlike
the time-dilation solution, CZ-UMTS maintains the same absolute time durations
for symbols, radio-frames, and TTIs. The number of CZ-UMTS chips is 1/N^th^ of
the number of UMTS chips in the same time duration, hence the symbol SNR drops
by the factor N. Similarly, the number of OVSF codes also drops by a factor of
N in CZ-UMTS relative to UMTS, in order to preserve the orthogonality of all
the codes after the zero-out operation.
Based on the analysis in Figure 6.8A.4, we see that the expressions for chip
and symbol SNR in UMTS and CZ-UMTS are as follows:
**Chip-level SNR: Ec/No (both UMTS and CZ-UMTS)**
**Symbol-level SNR: (SF)*Ec/No for UMTS, and (SF/N)*Ec/No for CZ-UMTS, where
SF= spreading factor**
Note that the UMTS and CZ-UMTS symbols occupy the same time duration given by
SF *Tc where Tc is the UMTS chip duration, and SF is the UMTS spreading
factor. However, while the UMTS symbol has SF UMTS chips, the CZ-UMTS symbol
has SF/N CZ-UMTS chips (each CZ-UMTS chip being dilated by factor N in time,
to give the same overall symbol duration).

Figure 6.8A.4: CZ-UMTS with enhanced filtering (CZ-UMTS): PSD and SNR
analysis.
### 6.8A.3 Control channel in CZ-UMTS
In CZ-UMTS, control channels in general follow the same principle of zeroing
out every alternate chips prior to RRC filter. Possible alternatives for the
SCH channel and PRACH preamble is to not perform the alternate chip zero-out
for these two channels. However, this may create additional complexity due to
the different implementation of the different data paths in transmit chain,
one with chip zero-out and without.
#### 6.8A.3.1 Control channel overhead
In general, control channels of fixed data rate sent over CZ-UMTS with
bandwidth reduction factor N=2 need to boost E~c~/Ior power allocation by 3dB
to match the same performance, since symbol SNR of CZ-UMTS is 3dB worse than
an equivalent UMTS system; see Section 6.8A.2. For N=4, the factor is 6dB. An
exception is the SCH, which may need boosting by 6-10dB.
It is not clear whether the P-CPICH needs to be boosted in order to meet RRM
requirement.
#### 6.8A.3.2 PRACH preamble design options for CZ-UMTS
The Node B needs to detect the UE's PRACH preamble and respond to it with AICH
for the UE to gain access to the system. The Rel'99 design for PRACH preamble
is based on a 16-chip signature that is repeated 256 times to construct a
4096-chip long PRACH preamble. There are 16 available signatures. The Rel'99
design can be used as is with the narrow-band filter and no chip-zeroing is
used. This alternative is the one used with F-UMTS.
{width="4.775in" height="2.0027777777777778in"}
Figure 6.8A.4A: Rel\'99 construction of the PRACH preamble (F-UMTS)
Alternatively the chip-zeroing approach could be used on top of the Rel'99
PRACH preamble design. There every second chip in the 16-chip signature is set
to zero, and this new 16-chip signature is repeated 256 times (CZ-UMTS
approach). However, when looking at the set of 16 PRACH preamble signatures,
the chip-zeroing will make it impossible to separate a signature pair _i_ and
_i+1_ from each other, when _i_ = {0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14}, effectively reducing
the available signature space to 8. This could lead to additional
complications with Enhanced Cell_FACH in the uplink due to the need to split
the PRACH preamble space to multiple sub-groups.

Figure 6.8A.4B: Preamble construction with chip-zeroing (CZ-UMTS)
#### 6.8A.3.3 AICH design options for CZ-UMTS
AICH is used to acknowledge the PRACH preamble in random access procedure, and
with Enhanced RACH, it may also be used to point to the UE to the common E-DCH
resource. AICH is a SF256 channel, and the transmissions take place in 2-slot
long access slots. The actual transmission duration is 4096 chips (1.067 ms),
and the AICH transmission in a single access slot is a summation of zero to
sixteen Acquisition Indications (AI) signatures and zero or one Extended
Acquisition Indications (EAI) signature. The AI/EAI signatures are 32 bits
long. Each AI/EAI that is transmitted is further modulated with +1 or -1.
Effectively each AI/EAI carry a ternary bit (+1, -1, DTX), and is further
spread with SF256 to the channel.

_Figure_ 6.8A.4C: Structure of Acquisition Indicator Channel (AICH) [TS25.211]
For CZ-UMTS, the spreading is effectively reduced to SF128 and the impact is
the same as with BCH/P-CCPCH. The structure of AICH does not require any
modifications as the AI/EAI signature construction takes place before
spreading.
As the data rate of the channel is so low and the performance is limited by
interference, similar to SCH, AICH could also be transmitted without chip-
zeroing. This alternative is the one used with F-UMTS.
#### 6.8A.3.4 PICH design options for CZ-UMTS
PICH is used to page the UE to read the paging record on PCH on S-CCPCH or HS-
PDSCH. PICH is a SF256 channel carrying a set of Paging Indicators (PI)
identifying the UEs to be woken up. The number of PIs present in a radio frame
is configurable from 18 to 144. The PIs are concatenated as a string of 144
QPSK-modulated SF256 symbols to be transmitted in a PICH frame. The remaining
6 symbols are not used. Each PI is transmitting either a positive or negative
paging indication, i.e. the channel is a constant-power channel over the first
144 symbols of the radio frame regardless of how many UEs are actually being
paged.

**Number of PIs per frame** **Length of one PI** 18 16 bits = 8*256 chips 36 8
bits = 4*256 chips 72 4 bits = 2*256 chips 144 2 bits = 256 chips
* * *
As with AICH, for CZ-UMTS, the PICH spreading is effectively reduced to SF128
and the impact is the same as with BCH/P-CCPCH. The structure of PICH does not
require any modifications as the concatenated set of 288 PI bits to be
transmitted in a radio frame is constructed before spreading.
As the data rate of the channel is so low and the performance is limited by
interference, similar to SCH, PICH could also be transmitted without chip-
zeroing. This alternative is the one used with F-UMTS.
### 6.8A.4 Impacts on network and UE
In this section, an overview of implementation impacts expected from the
introduction of CZ-UMTS is reviewed.
#### 6.8A.4.1 Impacts on network implementation
The CZ-UMTS waveform can be obtained from UMTS waveform by zeroing out every
other chip and using a dilated RRC pulse shaping filter. This waveform can be
constructed by applying a mask to chip sequence prior to pulse shaping.
The block diagram in Figure 6.8A.5 show how the waveform of CZ-UMTS with
enhanced filtering is constructed by using chip mask at the transmitter.
Notice that although the chip rate of CZ-UMTS is the same as the UMTS, the
mask 1,0,1,0 (for N=2), or 1,0,0,0 (for N=4), is used to zero out every
alternate chips prior to pulse shaping filter.
{width="6.6875in" height="3.7916666666666665in"}
Figure 6.8A.5: CZ-UMTS with enhanced filtering (CZ-UMTS) waveform using mask
Instead of applying a zero-out mask directly at chip level, it is also
possible to create the transmit waveform with alternate zeroed chips by
sending a copy of each channelization code using a pair OVSF code that cancels
out every alternate chip. This is illustrated in Figure 6.8A.6. The paired
OVSF codes are chosen in such a way that when added, every alternate chip is
cancelled. For example, by pairing two codes (1,1,1) and (1,-1,1,-), we have
(1,1,1,1) + (1,-1,1,-1) = (2,0,2,0), which leads to the desired effect of
zeroing out every alternate chip. This effect is illustrated in Figures 6.8A.6
and 6.8A.7.

Figure 6.8A.7: OVSF code pairing to emulate chip zero out
Pairing of OVSF codes can be visualized over the Hadamard code generator tree.
This is illustrated in Figure 6.8A.8, where it is shown that for every code in
the upper part of the code tree, one can find a corresponding code in the
lower part such that when added, the two codes cancel each other at every
alternate chip location.
{width="2.1354166666666665in" height="3.6354166666666665in"}
Figure 6.8A.8: OVSF code pairing
Finally, in both the above schemes, the chip sequence after the zero-out
operation must then be filtered by a new RRC filter whose impulse response is
a dilated version of the UMTS RRC impulse response, and thus has more
coefficients, implying increased complexity. Since the input to this filter
has the pattern of zeros created by the zero-out mask, a polyphase
implementation is possible for this filtering, which limits the increase in
complexity. Essentially the multiplication operations needed to compute the
filtered output are skipped when the inputs to the multipliers are known to be
zero. As another alternative, the existing UMTS RRC coefficients can be used,
but the filter is operated at a decimated rate, i.e., it receives a new input
every N*Tc seconds, where Tc is the UMTS chip rate and N is the CZ-UMTS
bandwidth reduction factor. These options are illustrated in Figure 6.8A.9.
{width="6.6875in" height="3.3541666666666665in"}
Figure 6.8A.9: Alternative implementations of Tx RRC filtering for CZ-UMTS
#### 6.8A.4.2 UE implementation
Similar to the transmitter, the receiver of CZ-UMTS may also be based on the
UMTS receiver. The key to process the half-bandwidth CZ-UMTS signal using the
full bandwidth receiver of UMTS is channel equalization, since UMTS channel
equalizer is designed to invert the full UMTS spectrum bandwidth. This is
illustrated in Figure 6.8A.10, where it is shown that the full-bandwidth
equalizer degrades the received signal by trying to invert the part of the
bandwidth with no signal energy.
{width="4.5625in" height="1.8020833333333333in"}
Figure 6.8A.10: UMTS equalizer of bandwidth W cannot be directly applied to
equalize the channel for CZ Scalable UMTS signal.
Applying a mask of 1,0,1,0, to received signal sampled at UMTS chip rate
_f~c~_ = _W_ allows to use the UMTS full spectrum equalizer for CZ-UMTS.
Consider CZ-UMTS received signal of bandwidth _W_ /_N_ , where _W_ denotes the
bandwidth of UMTS signal, and _N_ = 2 or 4. Here _W_ denotes the nominal
bandwidth of UMTS system. Consider _N_ = 2, and let the sequence _r~n~_ = _r_
~1~, _r_ ~2~,... denote the received samples of CZ-UMTS waveform of bandwidth
_W_ /2. By applying a mask of 1,0,1,0, and effectively throwing out every
other sample (with sample rate of 3.84 Mps, equal to UMTS chip rate), an image
copy of the CZ-UMTS received waveform in the upper part of the spectrum can be
created. This is illustrated in Figure 6.8A.11. Notice that in frequency
domain, the sequence
(1,0,1,0) = (1,1,1,1) + (1,-1,1,-1)
= (e^j2π0^, e^j2π0^, e^j2π0^, e^j2π0^) + (e^j2π0^, e^j2π1/2^, e^j2π2/2^,
e^j2π3/2^)
has a spectrum consisting of two deltas separated by half the UMTS bandwidth
(_W_ /2). Multiplying the received signal by this mask in time domain is
equivalent to convolution in frequency domain, and thus creating an image copy
of the lower W/2 spectrum in the upper part of the spectrum. Thus, the UMTS
equalizer of bandwidth _W_ can be reused to equalize the new masked CZ-UMTS
signal.

Figure 6.8A.11: Received signal spectrum after applying a mask of 1,0,1,0, for
sample rate = UMTS chip rate.
In the more general case that the UMTS receiver sampling rate is more than the
standard UMTS chip rate, different receiver masks may be needed. For example,
in the simplified case of sub-sampling of over-sampled signal, where the
equalizer subsamples a chip×2 oversampled signal, a mask of 1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
can be applied to the chip×2 samples before sub-sampling and feeding the
samples to the equalizer, as shown in Figure 6.8A.12. The corresponding
receiver structure is shown in Similar technique can be applied for rake
receiver. For example, if the received signal is over sampled at chip × 4 _,_
a mask of 1111,0000,1111,0000 can be applied.

##### 6.8A.4.2.1 PAPR
Since the transmitted waveform is modified for CZ-UMTS and FUMTS, there is
impact on PAPR and CM, see simulation results in section 6.8D. The resulting
impact on the UE implementation and the Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) needs to
be further studied in RAN4.
### 6.8A.5 Cross carrier scheduling for multi-carrier filtered CZ-UMTS
**As the scalable UMTS serves as non-standalone secondary cell, most common
channels can be removed and the available HS-PDSCH power increases. To further
reduce overhead and improve data transmission efficiency in the secondary
cell, cross carrier scheduling can be considered, as illustrated in Figure
6.8A.13.**
\- Cross carrier scheduling:
\- Data transmitted in the secondary cell (f~2~),
\- The control information for the data is always indicated in the primary
cell (f~1~), and an indicator could be explicit or implicit included in the
control information to notify the UE about which carrier this control
information belongs to.
\- HS-SCCH can be removed from the secondary cell.

                                                                                                                                                                                                         Non-cross-carrier scheduling         Cross-carrier scheduling

primary, 66% for secondary \~68-74% for primary, 90% for secondary NOTE: The
power ratios here are approximate. The impact of HS-SCCH overhead to the
primary is assumed to be up to 6%. The exact overhead will depend on the joint
scheduling HS-SCCH scheme adopted.
* * *
Another benefit of cross carrier scheduling is that it **possesses the
potential for reducing the total number of HS-SCCH monitored by UE**.
The benefits of cross-carrier scheduling for filtered scalable UMTS carrier
aggregation can be summarized as:
\- The available power for HS-PDSCH in the secondary cell is increased which
is good for data transmission in the secondary cell and also helps to balance
the control channel overhead between the primary cell and the secondary cell.
\- Potential for reducing the total number of HS-SCCH monitored by UE.
\- Potentially enabling UE DRX on the secondary cell when no HS-SCCH intended
for the secondary cell is detected in the primary cell.
### 6.8A.5A Design for cross carrier scheduling for multi-carrier filtered CZ-
UMTS
Assuming that non-MIMO mode is configured in any cell, it is possible to joint
encode the two pieces of control information together in one HS-SCCH. The
following Table 6.8A.5A-1 depicts the control information fields in Part 1 and
Part 2 of type 3 HS-SCCH. Since there is no MIMO operation, the PCI fields can
be released to signal other information, such as carrier identity indicator
(CID) which indicates the carrier which the corresponding transport block(s)
are transmitted on.
Table 6.8A.5A-1: Control information fields of type 3 HS-SCCH
+-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+ | **HS-SCCH Part 1** | **HS-SCCH Part 2** | | +-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+ | | **One transport block** | **two transport blocks** | +-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+ | CCS (7bits), | TBS(6 bits) | TBS(6 bits×2) | | | | | | Modulation (3 bits), | HARQ process (4 bits) | HARQ process (4 bits) | | | | | | **_PCI（2_ bits*）*** | RV(2 bits) | RV(2 bits×2) | +-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
By reinterpreting the **_PCI_** to **_CID_** , it is possible to reuse type 3
HS-SCCH design for F-UMTS carrier aggregation. The new type X HS-SCCH is
summarized in Table 6.8A.5A-2.
Table 6.8A.5A-2: Control information fields of type X HS-SCCH
+-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+ | **HS-SCCH Part 1** | **HS-SCCH Part 2** | | +-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+ | | **One transport block** | **two transport blocks** | +-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+ | **CCS** (7bits), | TBS(6 bits) | TBS(6 bits×2) | | | | | | Modulation (3 bits), | HARQ process (4 bits) | HARQ process (4 bits) | | | | | | **_CID（2_ bits*）*** | RV(2 bits) | RV(2 bits×2) | +-----------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
Below is an example of **_CID_** field information mapping.
Table 6.8A.5A-3: Mapping of CID
* * *
CID (value) The carrier that the corresponding transport block(s) are
transmitted on Other information 0 Primary carrier  
1 Secondary carrier  
2 Both primary and secondary carriers  
3 Both primary and secondary carriers Exchange the modulation of the two
transport blocks
* * *
When data is scheduled on only one of the carriers, the CID is set to 0 or 1,
which helps UE to identify which carrier the data is transmitted on. In this
case, all the other control information in the HS-SCCH corresponds to one TB.
When data is scheduled on both carriers, the CID is set to 2 or 3, which helps
UE to identify the data is transmitted on both carriers. In this case, the two
TBs have independent modulation schemes, TBS and RV, and a common HARQ
process, assuming the number of HARQ-process for both carriers are the same
and the two TB share the same HARQ-process id.
In type X HS-SCCH, since the modulation field is inherited from type 3 HS-
SCCH, the modulation order of primary TB is always higher or at least equal to
that of secondary TB, so CID=3 is used to signal the contrary case, i.e. the
case when the modulation order of secondary TB is higher than the primary TB.
Since there is only one CCS field, which can only indicate one TB, we may have
to make a trade-off between the flexibility of scheduling 2^nd^ TB and the
control information overhead. The CCS only indicates the primary TB in this
case by assuming all available HS-PDSCH codes are occupied by the 2^nd^ TB.
The assumption that all HS-PDSCH codes are occupied by the 2^nd^ TB when data
is scheduled on both carriers is based on the considerations below:
\- There would be no need to CDM users on the secondary carrier. The number of
available HS-PDSCH codes of the secondary carrier is much less, down to 3
especially in case of N=4 (BW=1.25MHz), it would be not necessary to apply
code multiplexing on the secondary carrier in two TB scheduling case. Given
each code contains 480 symbols per TTI, one code is able to provide no more
than 0.48MHz (for QPSK) \~ 1.44MHz (for 64QAM) throughput for a UE. It is not
worth to use dual carrier scheduling with only one code on the 2^nd^ carrier,
at the expense of control information overhead increase.
\- A UE with data transmission simultaneously on both carriers is expected to
be able to make full use of the HS-PDSCH codes of the secondary carrier. Given
the UE is scheduled with data transmission simultaneously on both carriers,
the data rate is more likely to be quite large and beyond the level the
secondary carrier can bear on, i.e. the UE is able to make full use of all the
HS-PDSCH codes at that TTI. Otherwise, it is not necessary to schedule the
data on both carriers and may better fall back to schedule data on one
carrier.
\- The primary carrier is more likely to be HS-PDSCH code limited, resulting
that there is a need to indicate the CCS information for the primary carrier,
since the primary carrier serves as anchor cell with the support of R99 UEs,
different kind of downlink control channels, CELL_FACH UEs and so on.
Since the same amount of bits will be transmitted over HS-SCCH type X as HS-
SCCH type 3, the coding process of HS-SCCH type 3 can be reused. In addition,
UE only has to monitor M HS-SCCH channels for cross carrier scheduling instead
of 2M channels for non-cross carrier scheduling, resulting in reduced
complexity.
This design option is one example solution for supporting signalling for
cross-carrier scheduling, and other solutions may be considered. Several
observations made on this design option are as follows:
\- This solution would not allow MIMO to be supported on either the primary or
secondary carriers if that were desired; other solutions which may allow MIMO
to be supported are not discussed here.
\- The impact of using the same HARQ process on the primary and secondary
carriers has not been studied.
This solution does not support the use of the scalable carrier for multi-
carrier operation for some users and standalone for others, if that were
desired.
### 6.8A.6 Impact on 3GPP RAN1 specification
In this section, impact on 3GPP RAN1 specification due to CZ-UMTS is reviewed.
Differences in RAN2/RAN4 impact compared to time-dilated S-UMTS have not been
studied.
#### 6.8A.6.1 TS 25.201
The sections of TS 25.201 that are impacted by the CZ-UMTS time dilation
solution are listed in Table 6.8A.2. The changes required are applicable to
FDD bandwidth.

Section number Section title Change 4.2.1 Multiple Access Specifying new
bandwidth options for FDD corresponding to N=2, and N=4.

#### 6.8A.6.2 TS 25.211
Since CZ-UMTS adheres to UMTS timing, no specification modifications are
required for physical channel specifications and timing relations in TS
25.211.
#### 6.8A.6.3 TS 25.212
If cross carrier scheduling is specified, there is some chance that the HS-
SCCH format could be impacted, depending on the eventual solution.
#### 6.8A.6.4 TS 25.213
TS 25.213 specifies modulation and spreading. For CZ-UMTS, the UMTS chip rate,
spreading, and scrambling are fundamentally the same as normal UMTS. CZ-UMTS
is different from UMTS in number of allowed spreading codes, and modulation
due to different pulse shaping and alternate chip zero out procedures. The
sections of TS 25.213 that are impacted by the CZ-UMTS listed in Table 6.8A.3.

Notes:
More realistic assumptions could be used based on RRM requirements. Current
results in the TR are indicative. The areas in which the indicative
simulations differ from the assumptions are as follows:
^1^The P-CPICH is modelled as either -10dB or -10+10log(N)dB in the indicative
simulations. The correct P-CPICH level is likely to be either -10dB or
somewhat higher.
^2^The PICH level is modelled as -12+10log(N) dB in the indicative simulations
^3^The HS-SCCH level for cross carrier scheduling depends on the specific
cross carrier scheduling scheme. In the indicative simulations, the HS-SCCH
level on the primary carrier is modelled as -12 dB, which assumes that MIMO
HS-SCCH is used and power controlled to achieve 1% decoding error at the UE.
More realistic simulations will use the yet to be identified P-CPICH level.
### 6.8B.2 Performance evaluation metrics for filtered scalable UMTS
For DCH voice traffic, the following metric should be considered:
\- DL
\- BLER v/s Ec/Ior
For HSPA traffic, the following metrics should be considered:
\- Throughput.
\- UL Ec/No difference
\- For latency:
\- Compute transmission delay CDF for L1 delay.
\- CELL_DCH latency
\- Compare the CDFs of the average number of the transmissions and then take
into account the increase in the TTI lengths to evaluate the latency.
\- Access latency
\- Consider with and without additional power/overhead.
\- For coverage:
\- CELL_DCH coverage
\- Examine performance at different geometries.
\- Access coverage
\- Consider with and without additional power/overhead.
Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) should be taken into account. The ICI model
is described in [9]. The interference rise metric should be considered.
In filtered scalable UMTS link-level simulation, the performance metrics shall
be carrier specific.
## 6.8C Link simulation results of scalable bandwidth UMTS with chip zeroing
Link evaluation results for filtered UMTS with chip zeroing is considered in
this section and some comparisons with filtered UMTS (FUMTS) studied in
Section 6.8 are presented.
### 6.8C.1 HSDPA link analysis
Results for downlink link evaluation for HSDPA is presented here. These
results are indicated of the relative comparisons between CZ-UMTS and FUMTS,
and with UMTS, with an 8% margin of uncertainty. These results are not meant
to be compared with Time Dilated UMTS. The assumptions regarding overhead are
listed for each set of results; however, more realistic evaluations that are
not shown here would use assumptions in Section 6.8B.
#### 6.8C.1.1 Standalone CZ-UMTS carrier
Link analysis is presented for UMTS with filtering and filtering with chip
zero out (referred to as the chip zeroing (CZ)) for DL HSDPA transmission are
presented in this section. The configurations considered are listed in Table
6.8C.1 and control power assumptions are listed in Table 6.8C.2

The spectral efficiency comparison between the different schemes in Table
6.8C.1 is given in Figure 6.8C.1.
It should be noted that the code space available for chip zeroing is lower
compared to UMTS. In regular UMTS, 15 out of 16 codes can be allocated for HS
data resulting in 94% code utilization. On the other hand, chip zeroing
solutions can only allocate 7/16 codes for N=2; when normalized with the
bandwidth scaling factor, this comes out to be 87% code usage for HS data.
This loss in code space does not occur for the plain filtered solution,
although inter-chip self interference due to filtering of the waveform
prevents achieving high-SNR high-rate regimes where all codes need to be
scheduledFurther, increased loss in spectral efficiency is observed when the %
overhead for the control channels is scaled up by the bandwidth reduction
factor. The reasoning behind this scaling up of power is attributed to the
reduced effective spreading factor for chip zeroing solutions and the desire
to maintain the same control channel performance as with UMTS.
The results presented in this section will vary based on the power levels of
the control channels. Hence they are only indicative of the relative
comparison between chip zero filtering UMTS, filtering UMTS and UMTS.
Enhancement to the plain filtering solution to narrow-bandwidth UMTS
deployment in the form of chip zeroing results in spectral efficiency to
levels no more than 0.5bps/Hz/cell lower than UMTS.
At geometries above 5dB, the plain filtering solution shows losses up to 60%
compared to UMTS. Chip-zeroed filtered UMTS improves spectral efficiency in
this geometry range (more than 5dB) to levels comparable with UMTS (i.e. 10 to
20% lower depending on control channel overhead scaling). This loss in plain
filtering is a consequence of severe inter-chip interference in plain
filtering resulting in saturating self interference at high geometries. At
geometries below 5dB, plain filtering slightly outperforms chip zeroing. This
is due tothe increase in % power overhead for control channels for chip
zeroing.

versus UMTS (5.0MHz))
#### 6.8C.1.1A HSDPA link analysis with chip zeroing assuming N times overhead
power ratio
The spectral efficiency comparison between normal UMTS (5MHz deployment) and
the filtered UMTS with chip zeroing (2.5 MHz) is given in Figure 6.8C.2,
assuming for filtered UMTS N times power ratio is assigned to the common
channels such as SCH, P-CCPCH,HS-SCCH and CPICH.
As with the results above, these results are indicative with an 8% margin of
uncertainty, and are not meant to be compared with time dilated UMTS.
From Figure 6.8C.2, it can be observed that filtered UMTS with chip zeroing
has lower spectral efficiency than UMTS. This can be caused by that a larger
portion of power is consumed by control channels and the less availability of
channelization codes. For 5MHz normal UMTS 15 out of 16 codes are available,
meanwhile for 2.5MHz filtered UMTS with chip zeroing only 7 out of 16 codes
are available, which is 7/15 of normal UMTS less than 1/2.

#### 6.8C.1.2 Multi-carrier UMTS+ CZ-UMTS configurations
The throughput improvement of multi-carrier combination of UMTS with a chip
zeroing carrier of bandwidth 2.5 or 1.25 MHz compared to normal UMTS is
analysed. The comparison is made with baseline UMTS in terms of the aggregate
throughput and the impact on legacy users (who can only utilize the UMTS
carrier in the multi-carrier combination) as a function of geometry and the
wireless channel model. Two alternatives for multi-carrier configurations are
considered. In the first option, narrowband carrier has HS-SCCH, and SCH as
the only two control channels transmitted. All other control information for
the multi-carrier UE is sent over the UMTS carrier. In the next option, even
the scheduling information (HS-SCCH) of narrowband carrier is sent over the
primary UMTS carrier. HS-SCCH on the primary carrier is similar to the one
used for MIMO operation. The relative power offset is set such that the
performance is 1% decoding error at the UE. The synchronization channel in the
narrowband carrier is retained in all multi-carrier configurations.

The performance of multi-carrier configurations in 6, 6.25 and 7.5MHz MHz
bandwidth is presented first when HS-SCCH is transmitted on both carriers,
with the power for narrowband carriers scaled by N (to maintain same quality
as UMTS in spite of the reduced spreading factor).
Fig. 6.8C.4 suggest that throughput gains are obtained for all multi-carrier
configurations (using 6 MHz) over the baseline UMTS with gains around 20% and
gains increase with geometry for U+S~4~: UMTS+Filtered-UMTS (N=4). On the
other hand, the configuration U+S~2~: UMTS+Filtered-UMTS(N=2) achieves 44% to
4% gains with gains decreasing with geometry. Configuration U+S~4~ has lower
gains at low geometries due to loss of available power for HS data (note that
HS-SCCH uses \~20% power for N=4, compare with 5% for UMTS). This power loss
is less important at high geometries. On the other hand, configuration U+S~2~
has lower gains at higher geometries because of the inter-carrier interference
between the squeezed carriers in 6 MHz.
Fig. 6.8C.5 depicts the impact on legacy user due to inter-carrier
interference between the two carriers. It is seen that configuration U+S~2~
results in greater than 20% peak loss in legacy user throughput (with loss
increasing with geometry).
Next, the performance of multi-carrier configurations in 6 MHz bandwidth is
shown when HS-SCCH is transmitted on only on the UMTS carrier. This cross-
carrier scheduling mode is expected to show increased aggregate throughputs
due to increased available power for HS data in the narrow band carrier. Fig.
6.8C.7 suggest that throughput gains are obtained for all multi-carrier
configurations (using 6 MHz) over the baseline UMTS with gains up to 25% with
gains increasing with geometry for U+S~4~: UMTS+Filtered-UMTS (N=4) while the
other configuration U+S~2~: UMTS+Filtered-UMTS(N=2) achieves 50% to 3% gains
with gains decreasing with geometry. Configuration U+S~4~ has improved gains
compared to when there is an SCCH overhead is present in the narrowband
carrier.
Fig. 6.8C.8 depicts the impact on legacy user and it is seen that
configuration U+S~2~ results in greater than 20% peak loss in legacy user
throughput (with loss increasing with geometry).

#### 6.8C.1.3 DCH analysis
The link level simulation assumptions for the DCH channel for time-dilated
scalable UMTS is assumed. In particular, the performance of AMR full rate
voice without DCCH in both downlink and uplink is studied.
The transport channel parameters are listed in Table 6.8C.4. Fixed position
rate matching is used in the downlink. The downlink DPCH slot formats are
shown in Table 6.8C.4. The DPCH slot format 8 is used for the AMR12.2k voice
traffic.
In the uplink, the spreading factor of DPDCH for the FULL rate voice packet is
64. For equal comparison, the same set of rate matching attributes for all
schemes is used. The amplitude scale factors for uplink physical channels are
given in Table 6.8C.5.

The uplink performance is shown in Table 6.8C.6. It can be seen that the loss
of filtered UMTS and filtering with chip zeroing UMTS are both around 3dB. The
filtered UMTS sends chips with the original chip rate to a filter with half
bandwidth. The self-interference caused by the ICI reduces the spreading gain
by nearly half. So it requires 3dB higher EcNo to compensate the loss. The
similar loss of spreading gain also happens to the enhanced filtered UMTS
since the adjacent chips is zeroed out. So these two schemes have more or less
the similar performance on the uplink.
EcNo loss = (filtered UMTS EcNo -- 3dB) -- UMTS EcNo
It is not yet possible to identify which filtering scheme is preferred for DCH
from these results, since the results and any conclusions that might be drawn
from them have sensitivities to different assumptions.

The downlink performance is shown in 6.8C.2.1.2.4. As the Geometry increases,
the filtered UMTS experiences higher self interference caused by the ICI.
Thus, it requires higher EcIor to combat the ICI. The chip zeroing filtered
UMTS doesn't suffer from ICI due to the transmit filter. But it requires
additional EcIor to compensate for the loss of spreading gain. In general, it
has better performance than filtered UMTS in high Geometry region. The DPCH
EcIor loss is defined as
DPCH EcIor loss = (filtered UMTS DPCH EcIor -- 3dB) -- UMTS DPCH EcIor

Consider tthe performance of AMR 12.2kbps voice for filtered UMTS and chip
zeroing UMTS with 2.5MHz bandwidth. In the uplink, the two schemes have
comparable performance since the the uplink voice operated at low SNR region.
The downlink performance of filtered UMTS is worse than the chip zeroing
filtered UMTS at high geometry, but at low geometry the performance is more
similar. The overall difference between pure filtering and chip zeroed
filtering in terms of downlink system capacity is not clear; at high geometry
there can be differences of up to 6dB, but little or no losses for low
geometry UEs that need a significant amount of Ec/Ior.
### 6.8C.2 Uplink link level results
It is not yet possible to identify which filtering scheme for the uplink would
be preferable from the results obtained, since the results and any conclusions
that might be drawn from them have sensitivities to different assumptions, and
these sensitivities need to be evaluated for different assumptions that are
identified to be relevant.
### 6.8C.2A PRACH preamble simulation results
In figure 6.8C.8A the Scalable UMTS impact to false alarm rate of the PRACH
preamble is shown. The UMTS cell false alarm rate is taken as the reference,
and the Scalable UMTS performance difference relative to the UMTS cell is
shown in percentage points. It appears that with 2-Rx receiver the Scalable
UMTS false alarm rate is actually somewhat better than that of the UMTS false
alarm rate. This is most likely caused by the fact that the Scalable UMTS
receiver collects less noise. On the other hand, the single Rx receiver
performs slightly worse for the Scalable UMTS cell than for the UMTS cell.
PRACH preamble with chip-zeroing appears to perform slightly worse than the
simple filtering, but the difference is very small and could be attributed to
simulation noise. These results indicate PRACH performance in the presence of
AWGN interference. The performance in the presence of other preambles has not
been studied.

rate
In figures 6.8C.8B and 6.8C.8C the required PRACH preamble Ec/No for a given
miss detection probability in Scalable UMTS is investigated. The UMTS cell's
required PRACH preamble Ec/No is taken as the reference, and the Scalable UMTS
performance difference relative to the UMTS is shown in dB. It appears that
with 2 Rx the performance difference between UMTS and Scalable UMTS is
negligible. With 1 Rx the performance difference is otherwise negligible, but
with the extreme 3GPP Case 3 channel the Scalable UMTS performance is visibly
degraded. The difference between F-UMTS and CZ-UMTS is non-existing.

### 6.8C.3 System Simulations -- Bursty Traffic (Chip zeroed Filtered UMTS)
It should be noticed that for cross scheduling systems, HS-SCCH channels are
transmitted on the primary carrier. Also, for multicarrier systems, it is
assumed that on the first carrier N =1 and on the second carrier N = 2 or N
=4. For comparison, single carrier simulations where performed with N = 1 and
N = 2. N = 4 simulations are not shown. It should be noted that the results
with filtering should not be directly compared to similar results for time
dilated systems. For multicarrier systems the first carrier uses the same
overheads as UMTS system, except for the fact that for cross carrier
scheduling, the HS-SCCH overhead is modelled as in MIMO systems.
{width="6.697916666666667in" height="4.604166666666667in"}
Figure 6.8C.9: Average UE burst rate
In 6.8C.9 the average burst rate of the UEs is presented for different
scenarios. To compare the performance of different UMTS systems, single
carrier with N = 1 system is defined as the baseline system. It is noticeable
that wherever a 5MHz UMTS carrier has unused capacity, it is always better not
to utilise the low bandwidth carrier as long as there is excess capacity on
the 5Mhz UMTS carrier, or use multicarrier.
These results assume 100% penetration of multicarrier scalable UMTS UEs; the
performance with a lower penetration of such UEs was not studied.
It can be observed that with 100% UE penetration, each multicarrier system or
cross scheduling multicarrier system has a burst rate vs. number of UEs/Cell
graph which can approximately be derived by expanding both X and Y axis by the
same factor. Based on the results, assume K UE/cell in the baseline system
yield an average burst rate of R Mbps, then the average burst rate for multi
carrier with N = 1 and N =2, is 1.5 R Mbps at 1.5 K UE/cell. For cross
scheduling multi carrier with N = 1 and N =2, the average burst rate is 1.6 R
Mbps at 1.6 K UE/cell. At the same number of UEs, the cross scheduling system
yields a higher burst rate of about 7% more which is the result of lower
overhead on the second carrier.
Similar performance improvement is observed for cross scheduling multi carrier
system with N = 1 and N = 4, vs. multi carrier system with N = 1, N = 4. The
average burst rate of the multi carrier system with N = 1 and N = 4, is
approximately 1.2 R Mbps at 1.2 UEs/ cell while the average burst rate of the
cross scheduling system with N = 1 and N = 4 is 1.25 R Mbps at 1.25 UE/ cell
which is about 4% improvement. In Table 6.8C.8, the average, 5% and 50% tail
values of the average UE burst rate for different scenarios are presented,
which exhibit similar trends as the average burst rate presented in Figure
6.8C.9.

### 6.8C.4 Impacts on cell search
This section reviews the impacts on the cell search in CZ-UMTS system. Note
that, in CZ-UMTS, the chip sequence (before the dilated RRC filter) is zeroed
out every (N-1) consecutive chips out of N chips at the transmitter. At the
receiver, the received signal after the RRC filter is zeroed out using some
zero masking. Figure 6.8C.12 shows a block diagram of the filtered UMTS with
chip zeroing.
Figure 6.8C.12: Chip zeroing filtered UMTS
#### 6.8C.4.1 Impacts on synchronization codes and primary scrambling codes
The synchronization codes and primary scrambling codes (PSCs) are zeroed out
by applying some zero-out masking. For example, one can select zero-out
masking with a pattern (in UMTS chip) as 1010 for N = 2 and 10001000 for N =
4. Under the zero-out masking, it can be showed that the cross-correlations of
secondary synchronization codes and PSCs are equal or less than those in UMTS
system. This means that the cross-correlation properties of secondary
synchronization codes and PSCs are still maintained. In addition, the peak of
the auto-correlation of synchronization codes and PSCs are reduced by a factor
N. However, the reduced peak is still much higher than the noise floor
(correlations at non-zero lags). As a result, it is expected that the zero-out
operations do not affect the correlation properties of synchronization codes
and PSCs, which is further verified in the cell search (searcher) performance.
#### 6.8C.4.2 Synchronization codes
The auto-correlation of the primary synchronization code sequence is
summarized inFigure 6.8C.13. It is shown that with chip zero-out, the auto-
correlation peak is 3dB (N=2) lower than the auto-correlation peak in UMTS.
Table 6.8C.9 further provides the ratios between the strength of first three
strongest side lopes (at one-side of the auto-correlation) and the peak
strength. As N increases, there are more strong side lobes. In particular,
filtered UMTS N = 2 with chip zeroing has two strong side lopes within 3dB of
the peak while filtered UMTS N = 4 with zero chip has four strong side lopes
within 3dB of the peak.

-7.3 dB CZ-UMTS N = 4 -1.3 dB -3.3 dB -6.9 dB
* * *
It can also be showed the auto correlation properties of any secondary
synchronization code are similar to the auto correlation properties of the
primary synchronization code, which are studied earlier. The cross correlation
of a pair of secondary synchronization codes is demonstrated in Figure
6.8C.14. Here, the maximum and minimum values of the cross-correlation of any
secondary synchronization code pair are plotted. It is observed that the
cross-correlation properties of UMTS are still maintained with filtered UMTS
with zero chip.

#### 6.8C.4.3 Primary scrambling codes
To understand the correlation properties of the primary scrambling codes
(PSCs) under chip zero-out operations, the chip zeroing mask is applied to all
PSCs and computed the correlation of zero-out masked PSCs. Figure 6.8C.15 and
Figure 6.8C.16 demonstrates the auto-correlation and cross-correlation of such
PSCs, respectively. It is observed that the CZ-UMTS reduces the peak of the
auto-correlation N times. However, the CZ-UMTS has lower maximum and mean
values of cross-correlation.

(b) The max of cross-correlation for all PSC pairs
Figure 6.8C.16: Cross-correlation of PSCs
From the analysis on the correlation properties of synchronization codes and
PSCs under zero-out operations, it is observed that the peak of the auto-
correlation is reduced N times while the noise floor in auto-correlation at
non-zero lags and in cross-correlation is equal or less than the noise floor
of the correlations in the UMTS system. However, such peak reduction does not
affect the cell detection performance (assuming appropriate power scaling)
since the peak is still highly separable from the noise floor. The searcher
performance in the next section would further verify this.
Above design proposal 4 leads to a situation where if a UE in a 5 MHz cell
starts with a 1.25 MHz SCH search a false positive my occur.
#### 6.8C.4.4 Searcher performance
A three-stage searcher implementation was previously summarized in [3]. Note
that the sampling rate after the RRC filter at the receiver is half of the
UMTS chip. The simulation assumptions used to evaluate the performance of the
searcher in both schemes are summarized in Table 6.8C.10. It should be noted
that it is assumed that frequency synchronization is known a priori prior to
receiving SCH.
Table 6.8C.10: Simulation assumptions
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Simulation Parameters | Value | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Carrier frequency | 900MHz | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Cell Layout | Single cell | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | UE Antenna | Single receive antenna | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | P-CPICH_Ec/Ior | -10 dB | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | P-SCH_Ec/Ior | -15 dB | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | S-SCH_Ec/Ior | -15 dB | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Accumulation length | 3 frames (Step1), 2 frames (Step2), 1 | | | frame (Step3) | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Frequency offset | 0Hz | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | False alarm rates | Stage 1: 1% | | | | | | Stage 3: 0.1% | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Zero masking | N = 2: 1100 | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+ | Propagation conditions | AWGN, PA3, PB3, VA30, VA120 | +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
The searcher performance is evaluated in terms of a cell detection probability
which is defined as the probability that all of following conditions satisfy:
\- Stage 1 is passed, i.e., the slot timing is detected
\- and Stage 2 is passed, i.e., the frame timing and code group are identified
\- and the correct PSC is detected in Stage 3
In other words, the cell detection performance is a joint detection
probability of all three stages.
Figure 6.8C.17 provides the simulation results of the searcher performance of
both schemes for N = 2. Also, their performance is compared to the performance
of UMTS searcher. It is observed that the CZ-UMTS has around 1dB better
performance than the filtered UMTS without zero chip. However, it has about
3dB performance loss compared to the UMTS searcher. The loss of CZ-UMTS is
mostly due to the reduction in processing gain.

#### 6.8C.4.5 Impacts on searcher implementation and performance
From the searcher implementation viewpoint, the UMTS searcher can be used in
the CZ-UMTS system. The only change is to apply the zero-out masking on the
synchronization codes and PSCs. Figure 6.8C.12 demonstrates the searcher in
CZ-UMTS. The searcher implementation can be referred to [3].
Note that the zero-out operation reduces the processing gain by factor N. As a
result, the searcher performance of CZ-UMTS has around 3dB (N=2) loss compared
to the UMTS searcher performance. This loss could be recovered by boosting the
transmit power of synchronization channels accordingly.
## 6.8D Uplink signal characteristics
### 6.8D.1 Background
The uplink scrambling code was designed in Rel-99 to offer a bit better peak-
to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance than a pure random scrambling code.
This PAPR reduction scheme was referred to as HPSK/OCQPSK, and is implemented
in the uplink scrambling code generation by introducing a dependency between
consecutive chips:
With the introduction of chip zeroing in uplink, this particular
characteristic of the scrambling code is modified, since there will be no
"memory" between scrambling code chips actually transmitted. Hence, it is
relevant to study PAPR and cubic metric (CM) performance. A high PAPR/CM is
undesirable as it typically reduces the maximum power with which the terminal
may transmit in order to fulfill requirements on emissions, e.g. adjacent-
channel leakage power ratio (ACLR). In fact, the CM is directly influencing in
a non-linear manner the Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) requirements in RAN4,
i.e. the higher the CM the higher the MPR. The reduction in maximum output
power reduces the coverage and throughput. Avoiding this may be possible but
might require redesign of the transmitter, at the expense of increased chip
area and reduced power amplifier efficiency resulting in increased power
consumption.
### 6.8D.2 Simulation assumptions
Simulations have been performed to study the power distribution of UMTS,
F-UMTS and CZ-UMTS uplink signals. In addition, a reference case where the
uplink scrambling code for normal UMTS is modified to remove the HPSK/OCQPSK
component has been studied. This is done by simply applying the standardized
downlink scrambling code in the uplink direction.
In all the simulations a set of channelization codes with different spreading
factors and amplitude ratios (beta-factors) are used. Scrambling code number
10 was used in all cases, but additional tests indicate that the choice of
code does not influence the results significantly. Random sequences of data
symbols are then spread and scrambled, and a root raised cosine filter scaled
to the proper bandwidth with roll-off 0.22 and 10 times oversampling is
applied. The signal properties after the filter are then studied.
Three different reference bearers, i.e. sets of channelization codes / beta
values, have been simulated:
**12.2 kbps speech**
DPCCH: SF256 code 0, mapped to Q-branch, beta_c = 8/15\ DPDCH: SF64 code 16,

I-branch, beta_ed = 67/15\ E-DPDCH2: SF4 code 1, mapped to Q-branch, beta_ed =
67/15
### 6.8D.3 Power distribution
One way to study the properties of the signal is to look at its envelope power
distribution. In Figure 6.8D.1 we show the PDF of the transmitted signal for
the 12.2 kbps speech reference bearer, where the average power of the signals
have been normalized to 1 (linear scale). This shows the variability of the
statistics of the signal. However, the dynamics in the time dimension cannot
be seen in this type of plot.
The plot includes the PDFs for normal 5 MHz UMTS ("UL UMTS"), normal 5 MHz
UMTS but using downlink scrambling code ("DL UMTS"), 2.5 MHz F-UMTS ("F-UMTS")
and 2.5 MHz CZ-UMTS ("CZ-UMTS").
As can be seen from the figure, normal UMTS has the best properties with the
least amount of variability. CZ-UMTS seems to perform similar to normal UMTS
with a downlink scrambling code, which is expected since the chip-zeroing
destroys the PAPR reduction properties of the uplink scrambling code. F-UMTS
has a different distribution that most likely comes from the increased ISI.

### 6.8D.4 PAPR and CM
Signal characteristics have been studied for the three different reference
bearers. For PAPR performance, plots of the complementary cumulative
distribution function (CCDF) of the envelope power to average power ratio are
presented. In addition, CM values according to the formula in TS 25.101 have
been calculated and are tabulated.
#### 6.8D.4.1 Comparing 5 MHz UMTS with 2.5 MHz F-UMTS/CZ-UMTS
First we compare normal 5 MHz UMTS ("UL UMTS"), normal 5 MHz UMTS but using
downlink scrambling code ("DL UMTS"), 2.5 MHz F-UMTS ("F-UMTS") and 2.5 MHz
CZ-UMTS ("CZ-UMTS"). In Figures 6.8D.2-6.8D.4 and Tables 6.8D.1-6.8D.3 below,

#### 6.8D.4.2 Comparing F-UMTS with CZ-UMTS in different bandwidths
As a second comparison, we look at the difference in signal characteristics
between F-UMTS and CZ-UMTS as the carrier bandwidth is varied. In Figure
6.8D.5 and Tables 6.8D.4 below, the CCDFs and CM for the 1 Mbps 2 ms TTI EUL
reference bearer for bandwidths varying between 2 and 5 MHz are presented.

### 6.8D.5 Discussion
Although the simulations are simplified and e.g. have only been made for a
very small subset of possible power offsets and do not include HS-DPCCH, it
seems clear that both the narrowband filtering as well as the chip-zeroing
result in worse PAPR/CM characteristics compared to normal UMTS. Further more
detailed studies would be required to conclude on what impact the changed
PAPR/CM characteristics would have on the system, in particular with respect
to coverage. In general, the worse the CM is the larger MPR the UE would need
to apply. However, the translation of a CM for a narrowband carrier into a MPR
for this carrier would require further detailed studies in RAN4, since it is
expected that there is a bandwidth dependency and hence the old values derived
for 5 MHz carriers may no longer hold. In general, discussion related to CM vs
MPR are rather long in RAN4 and require large amount of simulations. Also, the
amount of work required depends on the features supported for scalable UMTS
(uplink CLTD, uplink MIMO etc).

### 6.9.2 System performance for full buffer traffic
#### 6.9.2.1 Evaluations based on user geometry distribution
This subclause presents the system level throughput results using the user CDF
from and link level throughput results from subclause 6.1.2.1. Inter-carrier
interference between the constituent carriers is modelled for the multi-
carrier configurations.
In Table 6.9.2.1-1, it is observed that both the multi-carrier options (in 6
MHz spectrum) achieve significantly higher throughput compared to UMTS for the
multi-carrier users in this system. For 100% loading, the configuration U+S~2~
achieves slightly higher throughputs compared to the configuration U+S~4~,
while when the loading in adjacent cells decreases to 20%, the configuration
U+S~4~ wins over U+S~2.~ On the other hand, there is negligible impact to
legacy users with U+S~4~ and fairly significant impact with U+S~2~.
Additionally, standalone systems record close to UMTS spectral efficiencies.
Additional PCCPCH codes help maintain the same latency as the UMTS for the
PCCPCH channel. It can be seen that there is negligible throughput degradation
for the standalone carriers after accounting for the PCCPCH power allocation.

For 50% penetration of time-dilated UMTS UEs, a weighted throughput from Table
6.9.2.1-1 is used.\ These results are shown in Table 6.9.2.1-2. The
configuration U+S~4~ (highlighted in red) achieves significantly higher
throughput than UMTS for all fading channels and loading fractions, for Time-
Dilated UMTS capable user penetrations as small as 25%. On the other hand, the
configuration U+S~2~ can record a loss (8.3 Mbps from 9.0 Mbps in PA3 channel
with lightly loaded adjacent cells) compared to baseline UMTS for 25% Time-
Dilated UMTS user penetration.

User Geometry distribution (for 14 k random user placements) in a 57-cell
layout is given in Figure 6.9.2.1-1.\ In the analysis in this subclause, an
equal allocation of resources among the users and a simple averaging of link
level throughputs based on the user geometry distribution were used.
{width="4.280555555555556in" height="3.201388888888889in"}
Figure 6.9.2.1-1: User geometry CDF
In another evaluation, a similar analysis was conducted where the cell
throughput is computed based on the user geometry CDF (see Figure 6.9.2.1-1)
and the input from link simulation results. Cell Throughput results are
provided in Table 6.9.2.1-3. For multi-carrier option (in 6 MHz spectrum),
about 20% throughput gain over UMTS can be observed.
The interference from small bandwidth carrier to legacy UMTS carrier in case
of carrier aggregation U+S~4~ is seen to be negligible. This is proved by
comparing the standalone UMTS throughput with the legacy user throughput in
multi-carrier.
For standalone time-dilated UMTS results, it is observed that the spectral
efficiency is close to UMTS.\ The observation is in accordance with the link
level simulation results in subclause 6.1.2.1.

##### 6.9.2.1.1 UE throughput
In this analysis, 8 UEs in a UMTS cell and 4 UEs in a time-dilated UMTS cell
with round-robin scheduling is assumed. Figure 6.9.2.1.1-1 shows the average
user throughput CDF for standalone UMTS and time-dilated UMTS in both 100% and
20% adjacent cell load scenarios under different propagation channels.\ It is
observed that the time-dilated UMTS user throughput performance is very close
to UMTS performance in all scenarios, which shows that time-dilated UMTS
performs very similar as UMTS in terms of UE throughput as well as data
coverage.

#### 6.9.2.2 Evaluation with a practical scheduler
Table 6.9.2.2-1 shows the results from a fuller buffer system simulation for
standalone time-dilated UMTS.\ For standalone time-dilated UMTS results, we
observe that the spectral efficiency is close to UMTS for most of the channels
evaluated except for the VA30 channel where a loss of around 8.9% is
observed.\ These results are in accordance with the ones seen in Table
6.9.2.1-3.\ UE performance is also shown under the assumption of 8 UEs in a
UMTS cell and 4 UEs in a time-dilated UMTS cell where similar observations can
be made.

## 6.10 Less relevant simulation results
### 6.10.1 Results for UMTS + 2.5 MHz time-dilated UMTS in 6 MHz block
assuming equal PSD
Figure 6.10.1-1: UMTS DL user throughput, file download
Figure 6.10.1-2: UMTS DL user throughput, full buffer
The system simulation results for the multiple-carrier scenario of UMTS \+ 2.5
MHz time-dilated UMTS in 6 MHz indicate significant losses in throughput for
the UMTS carrier. This is due to inter-carrier leakage even though the ICL was
calculated considering UE and BS with performance far better than the
specified values.
### 6.10.2 Results for 3xUMTS + 2.5 MHz time-dilated UMTS in 15 MHz block
assuming equal PSD
For this scenario, the centre frequency of the UMTS carriers and time-dilated
UMTS carrier was chosen to optimize the performance considering that at least
for one UMTS carrier, the ICL should be kept at a low level to obtain best
performance. Other carrier allocations are not precluded and we encourage
other companies to investigate these.
The frequency offset from centre of each carrier and the lower edge of any
arbitrary 15 MHz spectrum block in this case was chosen to be [2.5 MHz, 5.25
MHz, 8 MHz and 12.5 MHz]. The corresponding ICL values turned out to be \~ 10,
10, and 44 dB, respectively. Note that the time-dilated UMTS carrier was
allocated between the UMTS1 and UMTS2 carriers.

The system simulation results for multiple-carrier scenario of 3xUMTS + 2.5
MHz time-dilated UMTS in 15 MHz indicate losses on UMTS carriers 1 and 2.
### 6.10.3 Results for 3xUMTS + 1.25 MHz time-dilated UMTS in 15 MHz block
assuming equal PSD
This scenario employs the same carrier allocation strategy as the previous
scenario in subclause 3.1.3, i.e. the frequency offset from centre of each
carrier and the lower edge of any arbitrary 15 MHz spectrum block in this case
was chosen to be [2.5 MHz, 5.25 MHz, 8 MHz and 12.5 MHz]. The corresponding
ICL values turned out to be \~ 30, 30, and 44 dB respectively. The time-
dilated UMTS carrier was allocated between the UMTS1 and UMTS2 carriers.

The system simulation results for multiple-carrier scenario of 3xUMTS + 1.25
MHz time-dilated UMTS in 15 MHz show that the impact on the UMTS carriers is
negligible when using extremely good radio models.
# 7 Conclusions
This study proposes solutions for transmitting in smaller bandwidths as one
possible technology for replacement for GSM/GPRS/EDGE in these bandwidths.
NOTE: Other technologies, e.g. LTE, are not covered by this study.
The study on Scalable UMTS FDD bandwidth focused on the following deployment
scenarios:
\- Standalone
\- Bandwidths with scale factors N=2 (2.5 MHz) and 4 (1.25 MHz) were
considered with the N=4 case being considered only for HS data traffic.
\- Multi-carrier
\- Carrier Aggregation with an UMTS carrier was also considered where the
secondary carrier was either N=2 or N=4; i.e. a total of 7.5 MHz or 6 MHz of
bandwidth
The scenarios above have been studied in Bands VIII and I.\ A more detailed
description of the deployment scenarios is provided in clause 6.2 of the
present document.
The following solutions for Scalable UMTS were proposed during the study:
**Time Dilation**
\- In this solution, the UMTS chip rate is scaled by a factor of N which
results in a smaller bandwidth. The TTI length increases by a factor of N as a
result while other aspects such as number of HARQ processes, retransmissions,
coding, etc. are unchanged.\ More details on time-dilated UMTS can be found in
subclause 6.1.\ In the present document, this solution is referred to as time-
dilated UMTS.\ Time dilated UMTS aims to improve performance by increasing
latency.
**Scalable UMTS by Filtering (FUMTS)**
\- This solution achieves a lower bandwidth by modifying the RRC filter to
match the target bandwidth. All other aspects of the UMTS transmit and receive
chains were unchanged.\ Additional details can be found in subclause 6.2.\
Scalable UMTS by filtering experiences larger Inter Symbol Interference than
normal UMTS.
**Scalable UMTS by filtering and chip zeroing/spreading factor dilation (CZ-
UMTS)**
\- This solution mitigates the inter symbol interference experienced with
filtered UMTS, by zeroing all chips except every Nth chip of the 3.84 Mcps
UMTS signal.\ Thus, the solution reduces the size of the OVSF code tree by a
factor N.
In the standalone case, if an operator has a 5 MHz UMTS carrier available that
is not fully loaded, it is better to map users to the 5 MHz carrier, since the
users will experience better throughput on 5 MHz than 2.5 MHz.\ In the
multicarrier case, multicarrier users can benefit from increased throughput;
the extent of the benefit depends on the bandwidth and the penetration level
of multicarrier users. Strategies (e.g. incentives) need to be developed and
executed by an operator that will ensure a good penetration of time-dilated
UMTS capable UEs.
## 7.1 Conclusions for Time-Dilated UMTS
Downlink link level simulations have indicated that, for standalone (depending
on channel conditions):
\- At a cell edge geometry (-5 dB), time-dilated UMTS throughput is around
33-48% of normal UMTS throughput;
\- At a median geometry (5 dB), time-dilated UMTS throughput is around 37-48%
of normal UMTS throughput;
\- At a high geometry, near the cell centre, time-dilated UMTS throughput is
around 44-50% of normal UMTS throughput.
However, when using a normalized throughput which corresponds to spectral
efficiency, the performance of time-dilated UMTS was between 75% to 100% of
the spectral efficiency of UMTS .
Uplink link level simulations were performed, for one Rx EbNo value for each
of the HARQ operating points of 1% BLER after 4 transmissions and 10% BLER
after 1 transmission.
When DCH traffic was considered on the downlink, N=2 standalone time-dilated
UMTS provides equivalent spectral efficiency as normal UMTS system (i.e. time-
dilated UMTS requires approximately 3 dB higher Ec/Ior for the same data
rate). The solution for DCH traffic is described in Clause 6.1.1.3.\ It is
ensured that the latency requirements for DCH transmission in time-dilated
UMTS match that of normal UMTS.
Downlink system level modelling indicates that in bursty traffic in low load
scenarios, the downlink burst rate of time-dilated UMTS N=2 is in the range
4-10% less than half that of UMTS. For the case when N=4, the burst rate is in
the range 4-7% less than a quarter of that for UMTS at low loads. The
simulation results in Pedestrian A indicated that an additional 2.5 MHz may
provide up to 25% extra capacity in Band VIII or 15% in Band I, assuming a
minimum user burst rate of 1 Mbps. Full buffer simulation results comparing
time-dilated UMTS and UMTS spectral efficiencies are in subclause 6.9.2.\ The
receivers assumed for the simulations performed were optimized for the UMTS
carrier.\ Further receiver optimizations for time-dilated and filtered UMTS
are possible.
Uplink system level evaluations were not performed, and therefore no
conclusions can be drawn on this aspect.
In Carrier Aggregation scenarios, where there are no legacy users (i.e. all
users are capable of carrier aggregation, including between carriers of
unequal bandwidths) the performance can improve by around 50% as expected for
bursty traffic assuming that the available bandwidth is 7.5 MHz. The
performance gains with no legacy users when a UMTS carrier is aggregated with
a time-dilated UMTS N=4 carrier are around 25% for bursty traffic models if
the available bandwidth is 6 MHz or more. The simulations assumed that all the
UEs were capable of carrier aggregation.\ Due to the HARQ RTT differences
between the two carriers, a latency difference by a factor of N (resulting in
a difference of up to tens of msec when considering HARQ retransmissions) in
MAC PDU delivery with carrier aggregation should be taken into account.
Unlike other DC schemes, with less than 100% penetration, legacy users can
only be mapped to one of the carriers; system simulations with intermediate
penetration levels were not conducted.
Maximum HARQ RTT, considering a usual operating point of 3 maximum
retransmissions in the worst case is increased to 72-96 ms for N=2 and 144-192
ms for N=4. For practical web browsing tests conducted in a lab, the download
times for time-dilated UMTS were comparable to UMTS at high geometries but
increased as the geometry decreased until it was approximately twice at low
geometry conditions. This can be considered to be representative of user
experience. For example, the Amazon Web page download time for time-dilated
UMTS N=2 is approximately double that for normal UMTS (i.e. 4 s for UMTS to 8
s for time-dilated UMTS) at very low geometries whereas at medium to high
geometry conditions, the Amazon Web page download times for both systems are
the same. For very large web pages, the latency increases were estimated to be
several tens of seconds for low/medium geometries (i.e. a higher number of MAC
PDUs per IP packet). Additional details are provided in subclause 6.1.7.1.\
The user plane latency on the uplink can be mitigated by utilizing the excess
power available on the uplink as long as the system not interference limited;
i.e. power may be applied within the UL RoT budget. However, such mitigating
techniques may have a corresponding impact on capacity.
The UE complexity for the time-dilation solution was shown to be lower than
normal UMTS for a low capability UE supporting only time-dilated UMTS and not
normal UMTS. However, it may be justifiable to assume that time-dilated UMTS
UE would need to also support normal UMTS, in which case there would be no
complexity reduction. Since the chip rate is a very fundamental parameter in
any CDMA system, it is not unlikely that the hardware impact can be very large
for certain implementations. It is also possible that other implementations
offer the possibility to change the chip rate quite flexibly.
In CELL_FACH, the amount of UE on time required per UL or DL event increases
with time-dilated UMTS by a factor of around 2, and the efficiency of DTX/DRX
for reducing modem power consumption is reduced. Further, due to the lower
burst rate of a time-dilated carrier, the total time the UE spends in CELL_DCH
to transfer a certain amount of bits will be higher with time-dilated UMTS
than normal UMTS depending on the relative loading of UMTS and time-dilated
UMTS which may also have a negative impact on modem power consumption.
However, the overall UE battery life impact is determined by the ratio of the
time spent in CELL_DCH state to the time spent in non CELL_DCH states
including Idle mode.
The signalling latency was analyzed in subclause 6.5 and it was shown that the
call setup delay would not increase significantly if mitigating factors were
taken into account (e.g., scaling SF by 1/N in order to maintain the same
bitrate as normal UMTS). However, if no changes are made, the delay increases
for time-dilated UMTS N=2 and N=4 by a factor of 2 and 4, respectively over
the air-interface and the feasibility of this approach depends on
implementation. The backhaul and network delays remain the same for both time-
dilated UMTS and normal UMTS.
Analysis of control plane latency assumed that the P-CCPCH is scaled such that
access latency is not impacted, at the cost of increased control overhead.
Coverage was compared between time-dilated UMTS and UMTS by evaluating the
Maximum Allowed Path Loss (MAPL) for a particular effective data rate in both
networks.
The analysis for voice indicated that time-dilated UMTS will have around 1dB
lower coverage than normal UMTS if the same carrier power is assumed. For
E-DCH, time-dilated UMTS provides similar coverage to normal UMTS if same PSD
is assumed, and a 3 dB higher coverage when same carrier power is assumed.
When CPC is considered, the link efficiency for time-dilated UMTS was shown to
be comparable to UMTS (i.e. throughput is scaled down by 1/N). Additional
details on the simulation assumptions and the results are provided in
subclause 6.1.4.5.1. The impact to UE battery life was evaluated by analyzing
the on-time percentage of the UE when CPC is enabled.
When in CPC DTX/DRX, it was found that for single TTI packet sizes and when
the UE is transmitting/receiving continuously (e.g. streaming), there was no
increase in on-time percentage at the UE. However, in web browsing scenarios
when the UE transmits bursts of several TTIs, an increase in the on-time
percentage of around 9% on the DL and 6% on the UL per event (corresponding to
a scale factor of 1.5 for N=2) was observed.
An analysis on impact and workload in RAN1, 3, 4 and RAN5 is provided in
subclause 6.1.5.\ In particular, many aspects of RAN1 and most core and
performance requirements, and potentially RRM impacts, need to be revisited in
RAN4, and RAN5 will need to address corresponding test cases as well as
revisit the SRBs.\ Depending upon the signalling mechanism used to
differentiate time-dilated UMTS from normal UMTS, the RAN2 specification
impact could be medium/high. However, an efficient signalling mechanism to
communicate time-dilated UMTS functionality as a new band would minimize RAN2
specification impact. A coexistence study was also performed for the UE and
Node B Tx/Rx characteristics against the existing requirements in the
specifications and the findings are summarized in subclause 6.1.6. Due to
coexistence aspects, the specification impact may not be limited to UMTS FDD,
and support for inter-RAT mobility may need specification support in that RAT.
When deploying time-dilated UMTS, tuning of some network and UE parameters
will be required to ensure that target KPIs can be met. Accordingly, the
impacts on MAC, RLC and RRC performance, including impact on timers and
procedures are captured in subclause 6.6. New RRM procedures may be required
in the network for managing user experience with carriers having different
capabilities.
For Scalable UMTS by filtering, link level simulations of scalable UMTS by
filtering showed link level spectral efficiency losses of 20% to 66% at high
C/I levels and zero-to-little losses at low C/I levels in downlink compared to
UMTS. Similarly, in uplink, a small loss was seen at low data rates and the
loss increases as a function of data rate.\ A potential solution shown to
largely mitigate these losses by setting every second chip to zero in the
transmitter was briefly discussed. The performance for 1.25 MHz Scalable
Bandwidth UMTS with filtering and without any loss-mitigating techniques was
significantly worse than UMTS in terms of spectral efficiency.\ System level
simulations of scalable UMTS by filtering were not conducted.\ The study did
not have time to analyze many of the aspects of the proposed filtered UMTS
scheme to the same level of detail done for the time-dilated UMTS scheme. Thus
Scalable UMTS by filtering may have the potential to overcome some of the
issues (e.g. latency) for time-dilated UMTS, but may have drawbacks (e.g.
spectral efficiency) of its own.
## 7.2 Conclusions for Scalable UMTS by filtering
Downlink link level simulation results, which are indicative of the
performance of CZ-FUMTS, imply that the spectral efficiency is likely to be
within 10-15% below that of UMTS for N=2 depending on the overhead scaling
factors. The loss is due to the reduced code utilization for CZ-UMTS and also
due to increased overhead channel powers. These simulations show trends but
not exact throughput levels since the assumptions for the overhead channels
have not been finalized. Therefore, these results should not be compared with
time-dilated UMTS.
For FUMTS, the indicative downlink simulations imply that the performance loss
is likely to be around 50-70% at medium to high geometries for N=2. At low
geometries the spectral efficiency of FUMTS is likely to be comparable to
UMTS.
For N=4, conclusions could not be drawn at this stage due to uncertainty in
the overhead assumptions.
When DCH traffic was considered, CZ-UMTS and FUMTS have comparable spectral
efficiency as UMTS. When compared with each other, the two schemes FUMTS and
CZ-UMTS have similar performance on the uplink since voice traffic is operated
in the low SNR region. However, the downlink performance of FUMTS is slightly
worse than CZ-UMTS.
It is not yet possible to identify which filtering scheme for the uplink would
be preferable from the results obtained, since the results and any conclusions
that might be drawn from them have sensitivities to different assumptions, and
these sensitivities need to be evaluated for different assumptions that are
identified to be relevant.
It is considered that the operation of PRACH with and without chip zeroing is
possible. Performance of PRACH with and without chip zeroing is comparable to
that of UMTS in AWGN conditions; preamble detection in the presence of other
preambles, and impact on Enhanced Cell_FACH in case of chip-zeroing, have not
been studied. It is noted that the number of PRACH signatures for PRACH
without chip zeroing would be the same as normal UMTS while scaled down to 1/N
for PRACH with chip zeroing. The impact of filtering and chip zeroing on PAPR
and CM in the uplink has not been concluded.
Downlink system level modelling indicates that in bursty traffic in low load
scenarios, the downlink burst rate of CZ-UMTS is in the range of 4-10% less
than half that of UMTS.
In carrier aggregation scenarios, the gains for CZ-UMTS are around 10-20% when
a UMTS carrier is aggregated with an N=4 Scalable UMTS carrier if the
available bandwidth is 6 MHz or more. The gains for CZ-UMTS are around 40-45%
when a UMTS carrier is aggregated with N=2 Scalable UMTS carrier in 7.5MHz.
When cross-carrier scheduling is considered, the gains for CZ-UMTS are up to
25% for carrier aggregation in 6MHz with N=4 and up to 50% for carrier
aggregation in 7.5MHz with N=2. It should be noted that the simulations
assumed that all the UEs were capable of carrier aggregation and the gains are
all relative to a 5Mhz UMTS carrier. The gains with carrier aggregation with
lower user penetration levels have not been studied.
The benefits of cross carrier scheduling includes: increasing the available
power in the secondary cell and helps to balance the control channel overhead,
potential for reducing the total number of **HS-SCCH monitored by UE, and
giving a UE battery life saving compared to the degraded UE battery life of
multi-carrier operation.**
Assuming that standalone operation is not supported and there is therefore
only one uplink available, the impact on uplink performance of signalling to
support multi-carrier operation, and lack of ability to balance between uplink
carriers, has not been studied.
The operation of SCH with chip zeroing was shown to be feasible for N=2, with
boosting to compensate the loss in autocorrelation peak (around 3dB). For N=4,
around 6-10dB of boosting is required for the SCH channel. Possible methods
for detecting system bandwidth have also been identified.
An analysis on impact and workload in RAN1 is provided in subclause 6.8A.6 and
it was shown that there was minimal impact to the RAN1 specifications for
filtering based solutions. Differences in RAN2/RAN4 impact compared to time-
dilated Scalable UMTS have not been studied, and thus conclusions cannot be
drawn on the RAN2/RAN4 specification impacts. An analysis of the
implementation impact is provided in section 6.8.3 and 6.8A.4 and showed
acceptable complexity at least for some implementations. Complexity of FUMTS
and CZ-UMTS can be different for different implementations.
In summary, it is considered that there is the potential for gains in carrier
aggregation scenarios (over a 5Mhz UMTS carrier) when a UMTS carrier is
aggregated with a Scalable UMTS carrier (N=2 or 4) and a CZ-UMTS filtering
solution is used; the ability to realize these gains will depend on the
spectrum scenario and the scalable UMTS penetration level. For standalone
Scalable UMTS carrier deployment, adequate downlink throughputs can be
achieved, at least for N=2 with CZ-UMTS. The choice of the exact solution
(FUMTS or CZ-UMTS) for the uplink can be based on further study.
If FUMTS or CZ-FUMTS is specified, some flexibility in bandwidth may be
possible, e.g. the exact carrier bandwidth need not be exactly 2.5 MHz.
Initial observations have been made, that the following aspects have not been
considered in any detail by RAN1:
\- The degree to which scalable UMTS and UMTS features should be tied
\- How capability signaling should be managed, considering signaling and test
overhead
\- Impacts on the overall benefit of scalable UMTS and carrier management of
not supporting all UMTS features
Specification complexity and management
