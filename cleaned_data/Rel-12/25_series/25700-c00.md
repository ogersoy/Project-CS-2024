# 1 Scope
In the past few years, a considerable increase in number of users as well as
offered traffic per user has been experienced in HSPA networks, both in the
downlink and in the uplink.
In response to this, several features have been standardized in 3GPP. These
include multi-carrier HSPA, downlink and uplink CELL_FACH state enhancements,
and introduction of downlink and uplink MIMO. However, much of the focus has
been on improving downlink performance and further enhancements are needed for
the uplink to handle increasing traffic load as well as new traffic types.

# 4 Objectives of the Study on Further EUL enhancements
This study should fulfill the following objective of identifying potential
technical solutions for increasing the uplink capacity, coverage and end user
performance (e.g. latency, achievable rates, etc.). The improvements should
address following scenarios:
\- Improvements to uplink user plane cell capacity with high number of users
(high priority).
\- Improvements to uplink coverage and latency (lower priority).
Currently identified areas include:
1) Enabling high user bitrates in a mixed-traffic scenario by means of, e.g.,
a more efficient method of confining high-RoT operation to dedicated secondary
carriers.
2) Rate Adaptation to support improved power and rate control for high rates.
3) Improvements to handling of dynamic traffic on EUL, e.g. more efficient
grant handling, improvements to the handling of scheduled and non-scheduled
data and control transmissions during bursty traffic, etc.
4) Improvements to EUL coverage when using single RAB as well as various
multi-RAB combinations.
5) Improvements to current access control mechanism to provide efficient
approach for UTRAN in case of uplink overload.
6) Reduce UL control channel overhead for HSPA operation.
7) Mechanisms to perform UL data compression between the UE and the RAN
\- Evaluate compression gains and performance benefits for different types of
smartphone traffic. At least UL capacity, signalling load, UE battery and
latency should be considered.
\- Mechanisms to selectively enable/disable data compression when traffic is
compressible/uncompressible.
8) Low-complexity uplink load balancing solutions, e.g. a fast uplink carrier
switching in Cell_DCH state, especially for configurations where the downlink
is configured in multicarrier operation while the uplink is in single carrier.
# 5 Study areas
## 5.1 Access Control
### 5.1.1 Background and motivation
Access Control mechanisms include Access Class Barring (Rel-99), DSAC (Rel-6),
PPAC (Rel-8) and Extended Access Class Barring (Rel-11).
ACB, DSAC and PPAC rely on the separation of Access Classes 0-15 among barred
and not barred. This is indicated in the SIB3, with separate bit strings for
ACB, DSAC PS/CS and PPAC. Depending on what kind of barring is applied, the UE
may not be allowed to send an RRC Connection Request to setup a connection to
any CN domain (ACB), may not be allowed to send an RRC Connection Request or
an Initial Direct Transfer to setup a signalling connection to a \"barred CN
domain\" (DSAC), may not be allowed to setup a connection to a \"barred CN
domain\" in order to respond to paging and/or perform a LA/RA registration
(PPAC) from idle mode.
Rel-11 Extend Access Class Barring (EAB) provides an additional access class
barring mechanism for UEs supporting EAB (the support can be configured in the
ME or in the SIM/USIM).
Other mechanisms may be considered, which allow preventing overload of the
access channel under critical conditions, spreading access attempts over a
larger time frame by means for instance of back-off timers, wait times and
persistence values.
In Rel-99, Access Service Class (ASC) allows to configure up to 8 Access
Services Classes with different priorities. The Access Service Classes are
mapped from the Access Classes (in SIB5 or SIB5bis) for idle mode or
correspond to the MAC Logical Channel Priority in case of connected mode. The
ASC together with other parameters broadcasted in the System Info will
determine the persistence value used by the UE to determine whether to start
the L1 PRACH transmission procedure in the present TTI or not.
Other Rel-99 methods for the access control are the back-off timer at
reception of AICH NACK and the wait timer in Cell Update Confirm and RRC
Connection Reject, which allows postponing Cell Update or next RRC Connection
Request by 1 to 15 seconds.
In Rel-10, an extended wait time (up to 30 minutes) for UEs supporting \"delay
tolerant access\" can be applied to the RRC Connection Reject, RRC Connection
Release and Signaling Connection Release.
A first finding that can be inferred from this brief description is that the
existing methods provide fairly good mechanisms for the access control of
users in idle mode. The legacy mechanisms may also be applicable, to a certain
extent, to users in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH.
### 5.1.2 Analysis
Table 5.1.2-1 lists the idle and connected mode scenarios and issues which
were identified and agreed for analysis. For each scenario which was analyzed,
the reason(s) why improved access control mechanisms are needed/not needed are
listed.
Table 5.1.2-1: Idle and connected mode scenarios/issues

#### 5.1.2.1 Idle mode
##### 5.1.2.1.1 SIB3 value tag wrap-around issue
Currently parameters for ACB (Access Class Barring), DSAC (Domain Specific
Access Restriction) and PPAC (Paging Permission with Access Control) are
included in SIB3. When the network is overloaded, in order to avoid barring a
specific category of UEs for a long time and guarantee the fairness between
UEs, the network needs to update the SIB3 to rotate the barred ACs (Access
Class) from time to time.
However, the frequent updating of SIB3 might cause the value tag to wrap-
around frequently, especially considering the short length of value tag, i.e.
value 1-4 for SIB3 value tag and 1-8 for MIB value tag.
Here are two use cases for SIB3 value tag wrap-around issue.
**[Use case 1: State transition from CELL_DCH]{.underline}**
Before a UE enters CELL_DCH state, the UE has stored SIB3 and the
corresponding value tag from the system information. When the network is
overloaded, SIB3 will be updated for access control purposes. However,
currently for a CELL_DCH UE, there is no way for it to acquire the latest
SIB3.
As a result, after the UE enters IDLE state from CELL_DCH state, it is
possible that the current value tag is identical to the previously stored
value for SIB3, and then the UE may not re-acquire SIB3 even if SIB3 has been
updated. As a consequence, the UE may have out of date barring information.
**[Use case 2: Cell reselection]{.underline}**
A UE in IDLE mode may perform cell reselection procedure. If the UE reselects
to a cell for which the UE already has stored valid SIB3, the UE will consider
the content of the stored SIB3 unchanged when the value tag of stored SIB3 is
the same as the one acquired in MIB of that cell, and thus the UE will have
out of date barring information.
##### 5.1.2.1.2 Wait Time
To avoid UE accessing continuously, the network can indicate in the RRC
CONNECTION REJECT message a Wait Time to block the subsequent RRC connection
request(s) for a period for a UE in IDLE mode. However, currently the Wait
Time is common for both PS domain and CS domain. If the UE is first rejected
due to a PS access request, the corresponding Wait Time will also prevent UE
triggering a CS call request.
In case of network congestion scenarios, the network may want to restrict the
UE accessing the PS domain and allow UE accessing the CS domain.
Additionally the wait time value could be extended to allow the network to
restrict the UE accesses for longer than the current limitation of 15 seconds.
Any extension of the wait time would also need to consider the impact to
terminating calls, as currently a UE does not respond to paging requests
received from the network whilst the UE wait time timer is running.
#### 5.1.2.2 Connected mode
##### 5.1.2.2.1 SIB3 value tag wrap-around issue
The issue described here is similar to the issue described in 5.1.2.1.1. Three
use cases for SIB3 value tag wrap-around issue are identified.
**[Use case 1: State transition from CELL_DCH]{.underline}**
**[Use case 2: Cell reselection]{.underline}**
Regarding the above two use cases, similar considerations as for IDLE mode
apply to Connected mode.
**[Use case 3: Re-entering service area]{.underline}**
Currently if the UE is \"out of service area\", it will perform cell selection
procedure in order to find a suitable cell. When a suitable cell is found, the
UE considers it as having detected \"in service area\" and the UE will camp on
that cell.
If the UE already has stored a valid SIB3 for the cell, the UE will not update
SIB3 if the stored value tag is the same as the value tag for SIB3 from MIB,
even though SIB3 may have been updated.
##### 5.1.2.2.2 CELL_PCH/URA_PCH state without seamless transition
###### 5.1.2.2.2.1 Control of UL data activity
In case of URA_PCH or CELL_PCH state without seamless transition to CELL_FACH
state, if the UE has PS data to transmit it will send a Cell Update. The
network can only control these requests by sending Cell Update Confirm message
with a wait time which will consume some radio resources for the unnecessary
cell update signalling and will also block CS call attempts.
##### 5.1.2.2.3 CELL_FACH state and CELL_PCH state with seamless transition
###### 5.1.2.2.3.1 Control of DTCH transmission in CELL_FACH and CELL_PCH
seamless transition
Currently for CELL_PCH state with seamless transition, a UE may autonomously
move to CELL_FACH state and start UL transmission. A UE in CELL_FACH state may
perform uplink DTCH transmission. It is not possible for the network to
control these requests. With the increase of the smartphone traffic, the
increase of networks and UEs supporting seamless transition to CELL_FACH state
from CELL_PCH state and with the increase of users in CELL FACH state because
of the introduction in Rel-11 of longer DRX cycles, the amount of DTCH
transmissions from CELL_FACH state is expected to increase considerably.
##### 5.1.2.2.4 CELL_DCH state
###### 5.1.2.2.4.1 DSAC update issue in CELL_DCH state
Currently the DSAC information is only sent in SIB3, so a UE in CELL_DCH state
cannot determine if the DSAC information has been changed. Here are two basic
scenarios for this issue.
**[Scenario 1: Network load status changes without UE mobility
behaviour:]{.underline}**
As shown in Figure 5.1.2.2-1, at T1, the UE is informed via DSAC that its
Access Class is barred for PS.\ Later, a CS call is established and the UE is
switched to CELL_DCH state.
At T2, the network congestion for PS domain is relieved and SIB3 is updated in
order to allow all the UE\'s accessing on PS domain (i.e. PS becomes unbarred
in DSAC information). However, the UE in CELL_DCH state does not re-acquire
the updated SIB3, and thus it is not able to send an Initial Direct Transfer
for PS. At T3, the UE is switched to a state other than CELL_DCH state, it re-
acquires SIB3 and updates the DSAC info. PS becomes now unbarred.\ The PS
traffic in this case is delayed for a duration equal to T3 minus T2.
Figure 5.1.2.2-1: DSAC update issue in CELL_DCH (1)
In addition, if the network status changes from \"Not Congestion\" to
\"Congestion\" (see Figure 5.1.2.2-2), users with out-of-date DSAC information
will generate more IDT\'s than expected, worsening the network congestion.
Figure 5.1.2.2-2: DSAC update issue in CELL_DCH (2)
Similar considerations may apply for the PPAC update in CELL_DCH state
**[Scenario 2: Network load status changes with UE mobility
behaviour:]{.underline}**
Similar issues may also happen if a UE has performed mobility procedures to a
new cell, e.g. a cell change from other cells/Node Bs/RNCs, inter-RAT handover
from E-UTRAN to UTRAN or from GSM to UTRAN. In these cases, the UE may have no
DSAC information of the target cell, or the stored DSAC information for the
target cell is out-of-date.
Similar considerations may apply for the PPAC update in CELL_DCH state.
### 5.1.3 Solutions
#### 5.1.3.1 SIB3 reading
Regarding the scenarios described in 5.1.2.1.1 and 5.1.2.2.1, a possible
improvement is to force the UE to re-acquire the SIB3 after state transition
from CELL_DCH state, or after re-entering service area, or cell reselection
procedure, regardless of the value tag. The solution does not have impacts on
ASN.1.
Regarding the solution, considering that the congestion time may be short from
a system point of view, to always force the UE to re-acquire SIB3 may lead to
additional UE power consumption. It could be further studied how the feature
is controlled /activated (e.g. network indicator and examples of how it can be
done). The feature may also have an impact on latency.
#### 5.1.3.2 Wait Time enhancements
Regarding the scenario described in 5.1.2.1.2, the introduction of mechanisms
to differentiate the wait time per CN domain is a possible approach to enhance
the Wait Time. The network can control the UE requests by configuring PS Wait
Time without impacting CS calls (and vice versa). The enhancement of \"Per CN
Domain Wait Time\" could be introduced in RRC CONNECTION REJECT message and
RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.
In addition, a possible improvement is to consider extending the value range
of wait time. Possible alternatives to consider, with regards to the handling
of paging requests received by a UE whilst the (extended value) wait time
timer is running, are:
a) UE doesn\'t respond to received paging request from the network
b) UE response to paging request from the network is differentiated on a per
paging cause basis.
The Wait Time differentiation, if needed, could be based on the mechanisms
described in alternative 2 and alternative 3 of 5.1.3.3.
Wait Time enhancements, if needed, could also be applied to CELL UPDATE
CONFIRM message.
#### 5.1.3.3 Control of DTCH transmission based on priorities
As observed in clause 5.1.2.2.3.1, the amount of users in CELL_FACH state, or
users that can seamlessly transit to CELL_FACH state, is expected to increase;
this will bring an increase in the DTCH transmissions from CELL_FACH, which
would therefore represent a significant portion of the overall traffic from
UE\'s in common states.
The uplink DTCH traffic, or part of it, may be seen as lower priority than for
instance DCCH traffic and therefore needs to be controlled separately. The
network should be able to apply some control policy among the DTCH
transmissions in order to differentiate between traffic relevant to
prioritised and non-prioritised logical channels or users.
One solution in which these needs can be addressed is by introducing the
concept of \"Access Groups\" for UE\'s in CELL_FACH state or CELL_PCH state
with seamless transition to CELL_FACH state, aimed at controlling the way the
UE\'s access the system for the DTCH transmissions.
The Access Groups may be composed of a UE related part and/or a Radio Bearer
related part. The UE related part of the Access Group may be based for
instance on the UE capabilities (e.g. whether the UE supports Rel-11 FACH
enhancements) or user priorities. The Radio Bearer related part of the Access
Group may be based for instance on logical channel/radio bearer identities or
priorities. Every UE would belong to zero one or more Access Groups.
The Access Groups, assigned by the network and signalled to the UE during e.g.
RRC setup, can be updated as a result of e.g. RAB Establishment. For each
Access Group the network can indicate in the System Information the wanted UE
action (e.g. block the access, delay the access)
The policy used to control the access can be per UE, (e.g. based on UE
priority or UE capability), per radio bearer, (e.g. based on Radio Bearer Id
and/or priority) or on a combination of UE and radio bearer type. The UE
priority and/or the radio bearer priority could, for example, be based on the
priorities used in the network to schedule HS-DSCH and E-DCH data.
The following clauses provide alternatives and examples on Access Group
control based on UE priorities, Radio Bearer priorities and a combination of
UE and Radio Bearer priorities.
**[Alternative 1: UE priority based control]{.underline}**
The network may associate different users to different Access Groups so as to
control the DTCH transmissions on the basis of UE priorities.
In the following example UE A, UE B and UE C receive the access control
information in dedicated signaling, e.g. via a RRC Connection Setup or Radio
Bearer Setup message. UE A is assigned AG0, UE B is assigned AG1 and UE C is
assigned AG2.
Table 5.1.3.3-1: user based AG
* * *
UE A UE B UE C **AG0** **AG1** **AG2**
* * *
Different handling priorities have been indicated with different colours in
Table 5.1.3.3-1 (green for high priority, orange for medium priority, red for
low priority)
When in CELL_FACH state or in CELL_PCH state with seamless transition, and
before accessing the RACH or common E-DCH, the UE\'s will read the SIB\'s (or
use the stored information blocks) in order to determine the status of the
AG\'s and the action associated to each of them. The System Info may for
instance indicate that UE\'s belonging to AG0 are allowed to access
immediately, UE\'s belonging to AG1 are temporarily blocked, UE\'s belonging
to AG2 are delayed according to a specific timer
**[Alternative 2: Radio Bearer priority based control]{.underline}**
The UE\'s receive the access control information in dedicated signaling, e.g.
via a RRC Connection Setup or Radio Bearer Reconfiguration message, containing
an association between AG\'s and RB\'s.
Table 5.1.3.3-2 below shows an example of Access Groups assigned to a UE for
different RB\'s: RB7 is associated to AG1, RB9 to AG2 and RB10 to AG3.
Table 5.1.3.3-2: traffic based AG
* * *
RB7 **AG1** RB9 **AG2** RB10 **AG3**
* * *
Different handling priorities have been indicated with different colours in
Table 5.1.3.3-1 (green for high priority, orange for medium priority, red for
low priority).
When in CELL_FACH state or in CELL_PCH state with seamless transition, and
before accessing the RACH or common E-DCH, the UE will read the SIB\'s (or use
the stored information blocks) in order to determine the status of the AG\'s
and the action associated with each of them. The System Info may for instance
indicate that AG2 is allowed to access immediately; AG3 is delayed according
to a specific timer; AG1 is temporarily blocked.
**[Alternative 3: Combination of UE and Radio Bearer priority based
control]{.underline}**
UE A and UE B receive the access control information in dedicated signaling,
e.g. via a RRC Connection Setup or Radio Bearer Setup message, containing an
association between AG\'s and RB\'s.
Table 5.1.3.3-3 below shows an example of Access Groups assigned to UE A and
UE B for different RB\'s: for UE A RB5 is associated to AG0, RB7 to AG1 and
RB9 to AG2; for UE B RB5 is associated to AG0 and RB7 to AG5.
Table 5.1.3.3-3: user and traffic based AG
* * *
        UE A   UE B
RB5 AG0 AG0 RB7 AG1 AG5 RB9 AG2
* * *
Different handling priorities have been indicated with different colours in
Table 5.1.3.3-3 (green for high priority, orange for medium priority, red for
low priority).
In this example the differentiation is achieved
  * per Radio Bearer: different RB\'s associated to different AG\'s, for the same user
  * per user: the same RB7 has higher access priority for UE B than for UE A (reflecting a user priority)
When in CELL_FACH state or in CELL_PCH state with seamless transition, and
before accessing the RACH or common E-DCH, the UEs will read the SIB\'s (or
use the stored information blocks) in order to determine the status of the
AG\'s and the action associated with each of them. The System Info may for
instance indicate that AG0 is allowed to access immediately; AG5 and AG2 are
delayed according to a specific timer; AG1 is temporarily blocked.
**[Applicability of Access Group based control to Signalling Radio
Bearers]{.underline}**
If needed, Alternative 2 and Alternative 3 described above could also be
extended to CCCH and DCCH transmission, i.e. RB0-4 by simply associating these
Radio Bearers to Access Groups.
#### 5.1.3.4 CELL_PCH/URA_PCH state without seamless transition
The network can indicate in the SIB that UE are not allowed to send CELL
UPDATE message with cause \"uplink data transmission\" and Establishment cause
not included.
#### 5.1.3.5 DSAC update in CELL_DCH
Regarding the scenario described in 5.1.2.2.4.1, a possible improvement is
that the network could send the DSAC information to a UE in CELL_DCH state.
Similar improvements may be considered for PPAC update in CELL_DCH state.
#### 5.1.3.6 MAC back-off timer based on priorities
The Access Group concept described in 5.1.3.3 can also be applicable for the
MAC back-off timer, i.e. different MAC back-off timers can be defined for
different Access Groups (long timer for low priority, short timer for high
priority).
### 5.1.4 Conclusions
Several scenarios were analysed and solutions have been identified for certain
agreed scenarios aimed at improving UTRAN access control mechanisms in case of
uplink overload.
The proposed solutions target the following improvements
  * handling of access control parameters in idle and connected mode > (including CELL_DCH state) in case of change of System Info
  * differentiation of access delays or access restrictions per CN > domain (so as prioritise for instance CS accesses over PS in case > of congestion) for both idle and connected mode
  * differentiation of access delays or access restrictions according to priorities for UE\'s in connected mode
The Wait Time improvement allows the network to differentiate, after a
rejection or a release, the subsequent RRC Connection Request attempts on the
basis of the CN domain identity. In case of uplink congestion it can allow a
prioritisation of, for instance, CS accesses over PS accesses from idle mode,
as a complementary mechanism to DSAC. Extension of the value range of the wait
time would allow spreading the attempts for the non-prioritised CN domain over
a longer time window.
For controlling DTCH transmissions one proposed solution allows the network to
apply priority based access control policies for transmissions from CELL_FACH
state or from CELL_PCH state with seamless transition. In case of UTRAN uplink
overload, the network can choose to prioritise certain users, UE types or
radio bearers over the others. In this way congestion mitigation can be
obtained, creating more access opportunities for prioritised transmissions.
Similar consideration can be drawn for the MAC back-off timer enhancements.
The control of DTCH transmissions in case of Cell Update message with cause
\"uplink data transmission\" and Establishment cause not included allows the
network to block PS, creating more access opportunities for CS data and
signalling transmissions.
Additional mechanisms considered to be beneficial for the system include:

## 5.2 UL data compression
### 5.2.1 Background and motivation
HTTP [1] is the protocol used for retrieving webpages. A visit to a webpage
typically consists of the web browser sending multiple, tens of HTTP GET/POST
requests. Each GET request is made to obtain an object such as an HTML
document, image, video, javascript or CSS file. These objects constitute
various aspects of the website, and are processed by the browser to display
the final webpage.
The following is a GET request made during a visit to www.amazon.com:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.amazon.com

Cache-Control: max-age=0
This GET is requesting the main HTML document for www.amazon.com. The request
consists of various HTTP headers such as Host, User-Agent, Accept, Accept-
Language, Cookie and others. Some of these HTTP headers, such as User-Agent,
Accept-Language and Accept-Encoding would not change over time; and hence
carry the same value in subsequent GET requests. The Cookie header, which is
often the longest, is used by servers to identify the user over time and hence
it is not uncommon for it to appear with the same value across several GET
requests. The Host header identifies the location from which an object is
requested, and this may also stay the same across GET requests for sites that
host all or a majority of objects in one place.
It is expected that when comparing the stream of GET requests made in the
course of downloading a webpage, there is significant redundancy across the
GET packets. There are several other HTTP request methods, such as PUT and
HEAD which also exhibit a similar behaviour since they follow the same format
for HTTP headers.
By performing UL data compression, the number of bits needed to be sent over
the air in order to convey the same amount of information is reduced. This
results in a more efficient use of cellular resources by either increasing the
application data rate or reducing the Rise-over-Thermal for the system.
Another possible advantage of compression is that it may enable more of the
packets to be transmitted in the Cell FACH state, since the traffic volume
threshold for transition to Cell DCH will be exceeded less often. The system
benefits of this are reduced time holding dedicated resources in Cell DCH
state resulting in reduced Rise-over-Thermal and reduced signalling load due
to fewer RRC state transitions. User benefit of this is increased battery
lifetime due to less time spent in the power demanding DCH state.
### 5.2.2 Analysis
Current mechanisms for compression include the header compression algorithms
IPHC and RoHC. These algorithms operate on the TCP, UDP, IP headers of data
packets. The payload of these data packets is left untouched by these
algorithms; hence they cannot be used for compressing the HTTP requests.
IPHC [4] and RoHC [5] are well-studied mechanisms used to compress the TCP/IP
headers of data packets. Generally, header compression may provide a
compression factor of 5x (i.e. TCP/IP header is reduced by a factor of 5). The
performance of current header compression algorithms is captured in clause
5.2.3.2.
### 5.2.3 Solutions
#### 5.2.3.1 RAN-level compression
Figure 5.2.3.1-1 shows the architecture for a RAN-level compression solution.
The transmission entity compresses a SDU received from upper layers (e.g. IP)
to create a PDU. The receiver entity performs the reverse function to re-
create the original SDU from the PDU it has received.
Here, compression is performed only on the payload of the TCP, UDP, IPv4/v6
packets. Hence, the compression and decompression layers need to parse the
TCP, UDP and IPv4/v6 headers to identify the start and end of the payload.
Figure 5.2.3.1-1: Architecture
##### 5.2.3.1.1 Bytes to be (de-)compressed by RAN-level compression
There are well defined standards that perform the function of compressing
UDP/TCP/IPv4/IPv6 headers. Hence, the approach taken is to extract the payload
part of the data packet and to perform data compression on it alone. The
various cases are illustrated below.
TCP/UDP-over-IP packet: The payload of the TCP/UDP packet is compressed/de-
compressed.
{width="6.0625in" height="0.3854166666666667in"}
Non-TCP/UDP-over-IP packet: The payload of the IP packet is compressed/de-
compressed.
{width="4.09375in" height="0.3541666666666667in"}
Non-IP packet: These packets are not processed. i.e., they pass through
compression without any modifications.
##### 5.2.3.1.2 Operations on TCP, UDP and IP headers
The RAN-level compression transmitting and receiving entities may change the
payload of IP, TCP and UDP packets. This could cause the length and checksum
fields in these headers to be incorrect, and hence they need to be updated.
##### 5.2.3.1.3 Details of RAN-level compression methods
###### 5.2.3.1.3.1 Existing compression methods
Gzip is a popular tool used for compressing data. The format of the file
generated by Gzip is provided in [15]. It, in turn, uses the DEFLATE
compressed data format specified in [14]. The DEFLATE data format supports
compression of data by two mechanisms. One mechanism, which can be thought of
as pattern-matching, is by identifying repeated string of bytes in data and
replacing such occurrences with pointers to previous instances. The other
mechanism is entropy coding of symbols using Huffman algorithm. It is worth
noting that the DEFLATE format limits the pattern-match, to point to instances
at most 32K bytes in the past and match length to be of at most 258 bytes.
When applied to data packets, the algorithm faces the limitation that the
pattern-match pointers can only point to instances within the packet. Due to
this it fails to make use of redundancy across packets.
LZMA (Lempel--Ziv--Markov chain algorithm) is another compression mechanism,
which is widely adopted in a number of operating systems and environments.
This algorithm uses a dictionary compression scheme similar to the LZ77
algorithm with a variable compression-dictionary size. When compared to the
gzip/bzip2 algorithms, it features a possibility to detect non-compressible
data, where upon it avoids a situation when \"compressed\" data becomes larger
than the original one.
###### 5.2.3.1.3.2 IPDC
In this clause we describe the details of one particular instantiation of a
RAN-level compression algorithm, namely IPDC.
The proposed algorithm is similar to Gzip and DEFLATE [14]. It uses the key
ideas of pattern-matching (LZ77 algorithm) and entropy coding (Huffman). The
main difference when compared to Gzip/DEFLATE is that the algorithm maintains
a fixed amount of memory at the compressor and de-compressor so that it may
keep track of the contents of past data packets. This memory enables the
pattern-matching algorithm to reference instances of repeat bytes across
packets.
**[IPDC Tx Entity]{.underline}**
This clause describes how the transmission entity compresses the input bytes.
As the Tx Entity reads the input bytes, it tries to locate strings of bytes
that have already occurred at a previous location in the input, or at some
location in memory. If no match is found, bytes are written to an
_Intermediate_Code_Representation_ array as literal codes, (i.e. decimal value
of the bytes is captured). If a match is found, a length code and distance
code are inserted in the _Intermediate_Code_Representation_. Tables provided
in clause 3.2.5 of [14] are used to determine the codes to be inserted for a
particular length value and distance value.
Note that since the literal codes span 0 to 255, and length codes span 257 to
285, they can be thought of as representing one code space. Since the distance
code occurs only after a length code, the distance codes can be considered as
representing another independent code space. Next, dynamic Huffman encoding is
performed on each of these code spaces (i.e. the literal+length space, and the
distance space). The encoding provides the bitstrings to be used to represent
each code in each of the two code spaces. Using this,
_Intermediate_Code_Representation_ is converted to
_Intermediate_Bitstring_Representation_. Note that since several length values
were represented by a single code and similarly several distance values were
represented by a single code, extra bits (as captured in the tables provided
in clause 3.2.5 of [14]) are inserted to identify which value is actually
intended.
Finally, the Huffman tree is encoded as described in clause 3.2.7 of [14] to
obtain an _Encoded_Huffman_Tree_. The final output consists of a concatenation
of the _Encoded_Huffman_Tree_ and the _Intermediate_Bitstring_Representation_.
The uncompressed version of the input bytes is pushed into the memory in FIFO
fashion. This is done so that the data from the latest packet that is
processed, is captured in memory.

Figure 5.2.3.1.3.2-1: IPDC Tx Entity compression operation.\ After
compression, a copy of the input bytes is pushed into memory in FIFO fashion
Example: Tx Entity Compression Operation
Figure 5.2.3.1.3.2-3 shows the intermediate steps in the compression operation
using input bytes set to \'0102030A0B0C0D\' in hex, and initial memory set to
\'0A0B0C0D\' in hex. As shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.3.2-2, since the string
\'0A0B0C0D\' is available in memory, it can be replaced by a length, distance
value of 4, 7.\ The length value of 4 maps to a code of 258. The distance
value of 7 maps to a code of 5 and carries an extra bit \'0\'.\ Hence, in the
_Intermediate_code_representation_ , we have the following codes 1)
length+literal: 1, 2, 3, 258 and 2) distance: 5. Separate Huffman trees are
generated for these code spaces (as shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.3.2-3).\ The
_Intermediate_bitstring_representation_ is derived using the
_Intermediate_code_representation_ and the Huffman trees generated. The
Huffman tree is encoded as described in clause 3.2.7 of [14] to obtain
_Encoded_Huffman_Tree_. The final output consists of a concatenation of the
_Encoded_Huffman_Tree_ and the _Intermediate_Bitstring_Representation_

**[IPDC Rx Entity]{.underline}**
In this clause, we describe how the receiving entity decompresses the input
bytes.
The input is parsed to obtain the _Encoded_Huffman_Tree_ and the
_Intermediate_Bitstring_Representation_.\ The Huffman tree is obtained by
decoding the _Encoded_Huffman_Tree_ , and is used to convert the
_Intermediate_Bitstring_Representation_ in to
_Intermediate_Code_Representation_.\ The _Intermediate_Code_Representation_ is
parsed to provide an output byte stream in the following way:\ If the code
represents a literal byte (i.e. the code is in the range of 0 to 255), the
byte is output as is.\ If the code encountered represents a length code, the
subsequent code is parsed as well since it represents the corresponding
distance code. The length and distance value obtained is used to identify the
string of bytes which need to be copied over. Depending on the distance value,
they may refer to a previous location in the output stream, or to a location
in memory.
The final output, which represents uncompressed data, is pushed into the
memory in FIFO fashion.\ This is done so that the data from the latest packet
that is processed, is captured in memory.

#### 5.2.3.2 Evaluation of solution
##### 5.2.3.2.1 General aspects of RAN-level compression
The compression of data will be carried out at the UE. The following nodes are
candidates for the placement of the decompression entity: SGSN/GGSN, RNC, Node
B. Any compression mechanism that is supported should operate over the RLC
layer so that the compression mechanism can avoid dealing with sequence errors
and re-transmission issues. Hence the UE -- Node B approach should be ruled
out. If the UE -- SGSN/GGSN approach is adopted, middle-boxes that look in to
packet payload, such as proxy caches, deployed at the RNC will not be able to
function properly since they will encounter compressed packets. This approach
also means that the computational resource requirement, for decompression,
will be much higher since a lot more data passes through the SGSN/GGSN than
the RNC.
It should be noted that compressing ciphered data or certain pre-compressed
data such as image/video/audio is not expected to provide much gains. If the
payload data is ciphered or pre-compressed, the compression gain will come
only from compressing IP/UDP/TCP/HTTP headers. In this scenario, the overall
performance might not show significant savings compared to the case where no
compression is performed.
A competing scheme to RAN-level compression could be to perform compression
and decompression at a higher layer, such as IP or application layers. In such
a design, the compression would occur at the UE and decompression at each IP
address it communicates with. For instance, if a website visit triggers the
web browser to load text from ip-address-1, images from ip-address-2 and
advertisements from ip-address-3, the compression algorithm would not be able
to take advantage of redundancy between data going to the different IP
addresses. Another point to note in such an approach is that due to the end-
to-end nature, any middle-boxes -- such as proxy caches -- may not be able to
function as they do today since they will not be able to decode the compressed
data. These problems do not arise in RAN-level compression.
##### 5.2.3.2.2 Evaluation of compression algorithms
###### 5.2.3.2.2.1 Evaluation setup
The various algorithms described above were evaluated using two evaluation
setups described below.
Evaluation Setup 1: The algorithms were run on tcpdump logs collected for
mobile devices within a corporate network. It was ensured that only traffic
going to the internet was collected. Table 5.2.3.2.2.1-1 lists the assumptions
associated with the performance evaluation. Under this setup a 5x compression
of the TCP/IP headers was assumed for evaluation of header compression
schemes.

captured in Figure 5.2.3.2.2.1-1.

Figure 5.2.3.2.2.1-1: Packet size distribution under Evaluation Setup 1
Evaluation Setup 2: The algorithms were run on data taken directly from the
IuPS interface, i.e., the one connecting RNC further to the core network.
Since the IuPS interface does not only carry the user plane data, but also the
core network signalling information, all the non-GTP packets were filtered
out. Furthermore, since the GTP protocol itself can carry control information,
only the so-called T-PDUs were considered, Every T-PDU was processed further
in such a way that the transport layer and the IP/UDP/GTP headers were
removed, thus leaving the user plane IP packet. Every decoded IP packet was
written into a separate file, which could then be individually analysed,
compressed, from which it was possible to remove IP/TCP headers etc.
Under this setup, the header compression mechanism emulates functioning of the
Robust Header Compression algorithm, as defined in [5]. The considered RoHC
profile handles not only 40 bytes IP/TCP packets, which are compressed on
average to 5 bytes, but also so-called 52 bytes IP/TCP packets with
\"options\", which are compressed on average to 8 bytes.
The distribution of packet sizes observed in the data collected under this
setup is captured in Figure 5.2.3.2.2.1-2.

###### 5.2.3.2.2.2 Evaluation results
Table 5.2.3.2.2.2-1 compares compression statistics for the payload part of
TCP/IP packets between Gzip and IPDC.
The metric \'Compression Level\' is defined as (compressed_size /
original_size)*100%.
Table 5.2.3.2.2.2-1: Compression statistics for the payload part of TCP/IP
packets
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Scenario (Evaluation Setup) | Compression level of Data | | | Transmission for UL Payload only | | | | | | (Avg_UL_payload_size_compressed / | | | A | | | vg_UL_payload_size_original)*100 | +-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | IPDC (1) | 14.7% | +-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+ | Gzip (1) | 71.4% | +-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+
The above statistics indicate that UL data compression that takes advantage of
redundancy across packets (IPDC) performs significantly better than per-packet
compression (gzip).
Table 5.2.3.2.2.2-2 lists the compression statistics computed over entire IP
packets (i.e. IP header + IP payload) on the uplink. Here, one can see that
header compression alone can provide up to 53%-68% reduction of net data
transmission on UL (depending on the evaluation setup). This is because a
large percentage of the bytes on uplink, in the analyzed logs, are from TCP/IP
headers. Enabling payload compression can provide gains both with and without
header compression. This provides the motivation for enabling header
compression in addition to data compression of the payload.

### 5.2.4 Conclusions
From the data provided, we notice that payload compression provides gains for
compressible data. We can also draw the conclusion that compression that takes
in to account redundancy across packets provides higher gains when compared to
the individual packet compression. Since there is a noticeable amount of small
packets in the UL direction, the header compression alone also provides gains.
The highest amount of compression is achieved when both header and payload
compression are enabled. Also, ciphered data or certain pre-compressed data
such as image/video/audio may not be compressed. Finally, compression between
UE and RNC does not require changes to the operation of middle boxes (such as
proxy caches).
## 5.3 Improvements to EUL coverage
### 5.3.1 Background and motivation
In current 3G networks, there is still a substantial amount of large macro
cells where supporting 2ms in the entire cell may be a challenge. In such
environments, it may be necessary to fall back to the 10ms TTI when a user
approaches the cell boundary. The switch to the 10ms TTI, however, should be
made as late as possible in order to retain the advantage of the 2ms TTI and
to avoid back-and-forth reconfigurations.
An efficient 2ms to 10msTTI switch is directly related to the accuracy of the
coverage measurement and to the speed and robustness of the switching
procedure. In case of non-optimal measurement triggers and slow switching
procedures, some conservative safety margins have to be taken into account
(e.g. long activation time for the switching procedure, leading to an early
switch), resulting in further loss of 2ms coverage.
### 5.3.2 Analysis
#### 5.3.2.1 Improvements to UPH measurements
The switch from 2ms to 10ms TTI is typically triggered by UL coverage
measurements. Common methods for measuring the UL coverage are based on
Measurement Report event 6A or 6D and UPH.
Event 6A and 6D, when configured, are triggered respectively when the UE Tx
power becomes larger than an absolute threshold and when the UE Tx power
reaches its maximum value. As for other measurements configured by L3, event
6A and 6D have the advantage of making use of filtering, hysteresis, time-to-
trigger etc. which improve stability and avoid fluctuations of the
measurements.
On the other hand the tuning of these measurements may be challenging due to
the necessity of avoiding too early triggers (i.e. when the UE is still under
a good 2ms TTI coverage) or too late triggers (i.e. the UE has already lost
the 2ms TTI coverage and the measurement report cannot be received by the
network).
An example of an event triggered too early is when UE Tx power increase is due
to a high rate transmission when the UE is still under a good 2ms TTI
coverage. An example of an event triggered too late is when the UE is moving
out of 2ms TTI coverage when not transmitting data and the UL DPCCH power is
still below the reporting threshold. When eventually the DPCCH power triggers
the event, the UE will not have enough power to transmit the Measurement
Report.
The UPH, UE power headroom, indicates the ratio of the maximum UE transmission
power and the DPCCH code power, averaged over a 100 ms period. The UPH is sent
as part of the MAC Scheduling Information. Compared to the event 6A and 6D,
UPH provides a better coverage indication since it is based not only on the
maximum UE Tx power but also on the UL DPCCH power. However this measurement
does not make use of filtering, time to trigger and hysteresis, hence it is
subject to fluctuation. In addition, existing UPH measurements as defined in
25.215 and 25.133 (e.g. the measurement period and accuracy) are not
considered optimal for the network to make a TTI switching decision.
One more issue is that the UPH does not have its own triggers but it is sent
only when the SI is triggered. Even though the SI can be configured
periodically, in CELL_DCH state it cannot be sent if the TEBS (Total E DCH
Buffer Status) is equal to zero, i.e. it cannot be sent if there is no data to
send.
#### 5.3.2.2 Reconfiguration enhancements
The switching procedure needs to be synchronized in order for the UE and the
network to know exactly when the switch takes place. As a synchronized
procedure, there is some risk associated with each execution, especially in
situations where coverage may be an issue. Furthermore, the activation time is
usually set rather conservatively to guard against occasional loss of the
reconfiguration message or its acknowledgement. The consequence of an
activation time not sufficiently long might be that the Node B and the UE do
not switch at the same time, remaining misaligned for one or more CFN cycles.
Figure 5.3.2.2-1 gives an example of misalignment of E-DCH TTI lengths in the
UE and in the network in case of retransmissions of the reconfiguration
message.
Figure 5.3.2.2-1: Example of misalignment of E-DCH TTI lengths in the UE and
in the network
The network sends a reconfiguration message with an activation CFN taking into
account at most one retransmission. Both the transmission and the first
retransmission of the reconfiguration message are not received by the UE,
whereas the Node B has correctly received the reconfiguration order (including
the activation CFN). At activation time, the Node B switches to 10ms TTI,
whereas the UE still has not received the reconfiguration message and
continues operating at 2ms TTI for one more CFN cycle. Data transmitted in the
meanwhile will be lost. If SRB2/SRB3/SRB4 are transmitted, the loss of the
data will lead to an RLC unrecoverable error.
The case outlined herein describes some limitations related to the switching
procedure, resulting in substantial loss of 2ms TTI coverage. Improvements
aimed at reducing the switching procedure lead time and at increasing the
procedure robustness would on the other hand allow gaining 2ms TTI coverage.
#### 5.3.2.3 Initial TTI selection
Currently, the UE may include Measured results on RACH in uplink RRC messages
if the network indicates to do so in SIBs, and either RSCP or Ec/No of the
serving cell is allowed to be included (but not both). Ec/No is critical for
the RNC in order for initial parameter configuration or admission control, and
RSCP can reflect UE\'s position or the coverage area, for example, the
coverage of 2ms E-DCH TTI or 10ms E-DCH TTI. Both RSCP and Ec/No may be needed
for admission control and initial TTI selection.
### 5.3.3 Solutions
#### 5.3.3.1 UPH measurements
As described above, UPH measurements do not rely on any filtering, apart from
being averaged over a fixed 100 ms period. A possible improvement would be
introducing additional and configurable (via RRC signaling) measurement
windows or filter conditions, as for current L3 measurements. Similarly, other
L3 mechanisms, such as triggering thresholds, hysteresis margins, time-to-
trigger, number of repetitions after trigger, etc. may be introduced.
Regarding the signalling aspect, the UPH measurements may be sent to the
network via the MAC protocol, using an 18-bit PDU having the same format as
the SI. It should be possible that the filtered UPH can be transmitted even
though the TEBS is zero. It should be possible to distinguish the filtered UPH
report from the legacy UPH. It is FFS whether the UPH can also be sent using a
RRC message.
#### 5.3.3.2 E-DCH TTI switching
The speed and robustness of the switching procedure may be improved by
introducing a lower layer (MAC or L1) synchronized reconfiguration with
dynamic activation time determination between UE and Node B allowing the
network not to determine beforehand the activation time (i.e. the activation
time would be \"now\"), but guaranteeing at the same time that both Node B and
UE are synchronized. The fast TTI switching mechanisms may rely on the network
pre-configuration in the UE of 2ms and 10ms TTI, and the Node B\'s sending the
final switching order via HS-SCCH order.
Either the Node B or the RNC takes the decision for TTI switching.
Figure 5.3.3.2-1 below shows an example of a 2ms to 10ms Node B-initiated
switching procedure (where the TTI switch decision is taken by the serving
Node B) relying on MAC UPH reports and 10ms TTI pre-configuration.
The UE sends an 18-bit UPH report to the Node B when the triggering criteria
are met. The serving Node B initiates a synchronized reconfiguration with the
UE to order the switch to a 10ms TTI. The synchronized reconfiguration may be
achieved by using a HS-SCCH order followed by a L1 ACK (not shown in the
figure). Optionally, if the reconfiguration fails, the UE will re-transmit the
UPH report according to a configurable repetition pattern]. Both UE and the
network will switch to 10ms TTI a predefined number of TTIs after the
completion of the synchronized reconfiguration.
In case of Soft Handover, in order to ensure that both serving and non-serving
Node B\'s switch TTI simultaneously, the UE may send a L1 or MAC indication
after receiving the HS-SCCH order and before the actual switch. Alternatively,
the serving Node B will inform the RNC of the TTI length update and the RNC
will forward the information to all the Node B\'s in order to guarantee the
alignment among serving and non-serving Node B\'s. In case L1 or MAC
indication is used, the mechanism should ensure increased decoding possibility
of the indication at the non-serving Node B\'s. This could entail, for
example, transmitting the indication at higher power or re-transmitting till
an acknowledgement is received from the non-serving Node B\'s.
Figure 5.3.3.2-1: Node B-initiated E-DCH TTI switching procedure
In case the RNC takes the decision, either the Node B informs the RNC about
the triggering criteria being met and the RNC responds with a \"proceed\"
message or alternatively the RNC sends directly the reconfiguration message to
the Node B. The RNC will inform all non-serving Node B\'s of the TTI length
change.
#### 5.3.3.3 Initial TTI selection enhancements
The network can configure, via system information, the UE to report both Ec/No
and RSCP values e.g. during RRC Connection establishment procedure. In this
case, the network will have additional information in order to make decision
on initial E-DCH TTI selection for the UE.
In Rel-11 Further Enhancements to CELL_FACH state feature, if Concurrent
deployment of 2ms and 10ms TTI is supported, the selected common E-DCH TTI
type can be used for initial TTI configuration.
### 5.3.4 Conclusions
Three main improvement areas have been identified and solutions for these
areas have been proposed.
The enhanced UPH measurements allow for a more accurate UL coverage
evaluation. The new triggers can be used to determine the switch between 2 ms
and 10 ms TTI. As a result, a better utilisation of the 2ms coverage area is
expected.
The TTI switch enhancements allow for a fast and robust reconfiguration of the
TTI type, contributing to an increase of the usable 2ms TTI coverage area. Two
main design options are possible regarding which node (Node B or RNC) takes
the switching decision.
The Node B based approach is faster as the Node B can make a decision and send
immediately the activation command to a UE, whereas the RNC should first
receive all the measurement information before making a decision. At the same
time, if the Node B determines when the criteria for TTI switch are met, sends
an indication to the RNC and waits for the \"proceed\" command from the RNC,
then this approach is the same when compared to a case when the RNC makes a
decision and sends the corresponding reconfiguration command to the Node B.
For the RNC based approach, if the RNC receives the enhanced UPH measurement
(or an indication of it from the Node B), it might have more information with
regards to deciding when to perform the UL TTI switch. As per the legacy
behaviour, the RNC can already configure and receive a number of various RRC
reports, such as 6x events and path loss measurements, which facilitate the
RNC with a decision making process. That can be also complemented with
additional information, such as established RABs, their QoS requirements, etc.
With the Node B based approach, in case of Soft Handover, if no additional
messages are exchanged between the RNC and the Node B once the latter makes a
decision, then an additional mechanism (e.g. a L1 or MAC indication) is needed
to ensure that non-serving Node B\'s are updated with a new UL TTI length.
Further evaluation may be needed on the reliability aspect of this mechanism.
Regarding the initial TTI selection enhancement, this allows the network to
better estimate the initial coverage area of UE\'s requesting RRC connection
from idle mode state, so as to allocate more efficiently the appropriate TTI.
## 5.4 Enabling high bit rates
### 5.4.1 Background and motivation
In a WCDMA system all users share the same uplink radio resources and can
access the system at the same time.\ The separation of different users is
achieved by using different scrambling codes. Due to the non-orthogonality of
the codes, significant interference is still experienced. The interference
increases with the increase of the transmitted bitrates. High bitrates
introduce high interference to other users, and those users must increase
their transmit power to overcome the interference and maintain their required
signal to interference ratio at the receiver, affecting the cell both in terms
of capacity and coverage. As a consequence the high bitrates supported by the
3GPP specifications are not sufficiently used in real network and mixed
traffic environments.
It is well known that the most efficient way for a very high bitrate user to
transmit in the uplink in a cell is when that user is alone, and can both
achieve the required high signal to interference ratio, and avoid affecting
other users in the cell. To enable ubiquitous high bitrate operation in a
real-network environment, it makes sense to consider ways to isolate high-
bitrates transmissions from users that are vulnerable to the high interference
created and vice versa.
A natural way to accomplish this within the current WCDMA technology is to
make use of a dedicated carrier, e.g. having a first \"regular\" carrier
providing the basic services and a second carrier dedicated exclusively to
high-bitrate transmissions.
One method of implementing this idea is to make use of the Inter-Frequency
Handover (IFHO) procedure. Users are admitted on the regular carrier where
user bitrates are limited to a certain maximum value. When there is a need for
higher rates, the UE is reconfigured to a dedicated high-bitrate carrier using
the IFHO procedure. When the need for high rates disappears, the UE is
reconfigured back to a \"regular\" carrier.
This procedure has some major drawbacks when we consider real bursty network
traffic, in that it entails continuous re-allocation of system resources and
increased RRC signalling (with associated delays). Furthermore the method
doesn\'t seem to be efficient in case of MRAB (e.g. in case a speech call is
initiated while the UE is configured on a dedicated carrier)
An improved method is to make use of the Rel-9 DC-HSUPA feature. A UE can
transmit simultaneously on two carriers, a primary carrier and a secondary
carrier. The traffic can be split among the two carriers based on the
respective serving grants. The primary carrier can be configured as a regular
carrier and the secondary as dedicated high-bitrate carrier where only one
user is allowed to transmit at a time. When there is no high-bitrate need, the
UE is scheduled to transmit data only on the primary carrier. When there is
the need, the UE can be scheduled to transmit on the secondary carrier in
addition to the primary carrier or on the secondary carrier only, and subject
to the availability of the secondary carrier.
This DC-HSUPA method is an obvious improvement for real bursty traffic
compared to the IFHO method above. However it still has a number of drawbacks.
For example it requires continuous activation and de-activation of the
secondary carrier, with evident costs in terms of delays. As an alternative,
maintaining the secondary uplink carrier active would imply frequent
transmission of the UL DPCCH with increased interference and UE power
consumption.
In order to overcome the issues described above, an approach is proposed based
on a cost efficient clean carrier concept, i.e., a \"Lean Carrier\" approach
that addresses the following:
1\. Signalling and delays
2\. Battery consumption for the UE
3\. Impact of uplink interference on DPCCH of inactive users
4\. Impact of DPCCH of inactive users on network capacity
On top of these high level goals, the Lean Carrier operations have to allow
the co-existence of legacy users and Rel-12 users.
### 5.4.2 CPC and power control
#### 5.4.2.1 Analysis
A Lean carrier capable UE may transmit on a primary and a secondary carrier
simultaneously. The primary carrier may be configured to a regular carrier
(with low to medium RoT) and is responsible for the UE\'s normal operations
such as maintaining radio-link quality, maintaining mobility, transmitting RRC
signalling and user data at a moderately low rate. The secondary carrier may
be configured to a Lean Carrier, a carrier similar to a Rel-9 DC-HSUPA
secondary carrier, which is better capable of efficient high bitrate/high RoT
transmissions for multiple users. The Lean carrier is preferably used as a
dedicated high bitrate data carrier.
For more efficient utilization of the Lean carrier it is desired that UEs can
transmit on the Lean carrier with very low latency. One way of minimizing
latency is to avoid delays involved with activating and deactivating UEs on
the secondary carrier. UEs on the Lean carrier are therefore always activated,
even for longer periods when data is not transmitted. UEs which are active on
a regular Rel-9 DC-HSUPA secondary carrier, but not transmitting any data,
will at least transmit periodic DPCCH bursts. Transmitting DPCCH bursts for
channel sounding when no data is transmitted works well as long as the
interference environment for a UE remains fairly stable in time. However this
is not the case in an environment with bursty high data rate smartphone users.
In these typical scenarios the interference can change quickly within a very
short time. For the UE that is granted to transmit on the Lean carrier, the
intra-cell interference it experiences is rather low. For the UEs that are not
transmitting, the experienced interference can be extremely high when there is
another high data rate UE transmitting on the carrier. This extreme
environment has serious implications on transmitting DPCCH bursts while other
high data rate transmissions are on-going, for example:
  * _Increased DPCCH cost_ \ A high SIR is needed for high data rate transmission. Since the UE keeps the same SIR target when it is not transmitting, the cost of stand-alone DPCCH transmission is rather expensive.
  * _Inaccurate power for initial transmissions\_ Due to the high interference on the Lean carrier, potential stand-alone DPCCHs of UEs not transmitting data needs to have a fairly high power to maintain the required SIR. When it is a user\'s turn to transmit, the high interference disappears and the SIR can easily jump up. The highly increased UE transmission power may decrease the maximum bitrate as the UE can easily become power limited. On the other hand, if there has not been any data transmission on the Lean carrier, the UE would have lowered the DPCCH SIR due to stand-alone DPCCH transmission and the DPCCH power may be too low when the UE starts transmitting data.
  * _Difficulty in following fading\_ Due to the large difference in interference when there is or is not data activity on the Lean carrier, there is a severe risk that inner-loop power control may react to the scheduling rather than the actual variation in channel fading if stand-alone DPCCHs are transmitted.
  * _Too low DPCCH power after data transmissions\_ The problems with the difference in required DPCCH SIR between a UE transmitting and a UE not transmitting data can become even more severe in some situations, for example when the UE finishes its Lean carrier transmission at the top of the fading pattern and the channel starts deteriorating.
#### 5.4.2.2 Solutions
There are several potential options to enhance power control and reduce DPCCH
overhead.
Option 1: Control DPCCH SNR instead of SINR
This method can be seen a Node B implementation method. Instead of SINR
target, Node B controls a SNR target for uplink Inner Loop Power Control. In
this way, DPCCH power will not vary too much with the change of interference
conditions.
Option 2: Disable the transmission of uplink DPCCH when no uplink data
transmission occurs. That is, no DPCCH burst are transmitted between the
uplink transmissions
Due to typical bursty high data rate traffic expected on a Lean carrier the
power setting for the uplink channels is crucial for initial transmissions,
regardless if DPCCH bursts are transmitted or not as explained in the analysis
clause. For power control purpose the following two scenarios can be
distinguished:
1\. _The time between two transmissions on the Lean carrier is large\_ This is
similar to the Rel-9 DC-HSUPA situation when the secondary carrier has been
deactivated and activation is needed before data can be transmitted. There,
the initial DPCCH power for the secondary carrier is determined from that of
the primary carrier plus a configurable offset to account for the difference
in fast fading between the two carriers. A similar approach can be used for
the Lean carrier:
PDPCCH,2 = PDPCCH,1 + Large_Gap_Margin,
where PDPCCH,1 and PDPCCH,2 are the DPCCH power of the primary and secondary
carriers.
_2\. The time between two transmissions is relatively short\_ For example on
the order of a typical CPC DTX cycle. In an environment without bursty high
data rate traffic the DPCCH bursts, post-ambles and preambles can often handle
the fast fading. In bursty high data rate traffic scenario this is not the
case. To account for the possible need to increase the power after a
transmission gap on a Lean carrier, an extra \"small gap\" margin can be added
to the DPCCH power, instead of tracking the channel, when transmissions are
recovered. This margin may be fixed or dependent on the size of the gap.
Option 3: DPCCH is only transmitted with E-DCH or as preamble during several
TTIs/slots before E-DCH transmission. DPCCH is not transmitted periodically
when there is no E-DCH transmitted as in CPC case.
DPCCH preamble is expected to benefit path search, power control and setting
of uplink grant. After preamble stage, path search performance is expected to
be reliable, DPCCH power is expected to be controlled at an appropriate value
and uplink grant sent by Node B is expected to be efficient. How to set the
length of DPCCH preamble may need further study.
#### 5.4.2.3 Evaluations on link level results
A compendium of the main link simulation results are included in Appendix
B.1.2, where the performance of the CPC baseline and the Lean Carrier proposal
are evaluated for several scenarios. The most relevant findings for each of
the evaluated scenarios are listed below:
  * **Impact of DPCCH bursts on data transmission:** At very high > bitrate, the simulation results have shown that data transmissions > are sensitive to even small amount of interferences created by the > DPCCH bursts from CPC. The transmissions can become unstable when > interfered by more than just a couple of DPCCH bursts from other > users. For this reason, the Lean carrier has a substantial gain > over the baseline CPC at 10 Mbps. The gain, however, decreases at > lower bitrates such as 5 and 2 Mbps, as can be seen from the > results in Sec. B.1.2.2 below.\ > The gain also decreases when longer DTX cycles and smaller DPCCH > bursts are used.\ > It should, however, be reminded that the current specification do > not allow different CPC settings to be used for the primary and > the secondary carrier for the same UE.\ > The results in B.1.2.2 also show that when it is possible to use > SNR power control and a lower operating SIR, e.g., -19 dB > (corresponding to a system-level SIR of 5 dB), the gain of Lean > from this aspect is further reduced and may become negligible in > some scenario.
  * **Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts:** Next the impact of data > transmissions on the DPCCH bursts was studied. The results show > that this has a significant impact on the performance. The impact > increases when there are more DPCCH bursts between two data > transmissions. More importantly, the gain of the Lean carrier over > the baseline CPC remains quite substantial even in the case of the > most extreme CPC setting.
#### 5.4.2.4 Evaluations on system level results
System-level evaluation of Lean carrier performance is given in B.1.3 below.
Simulation results for two traffic scenarios are provided:
\- Full-buffer users with a fixed transmission pattern
\- Dynamic traffic with lognormal-distributed file sizes and exponentially
distributed reading times.
The results show quite good gains of 1 to 2 dB in noise rise when a static
transmission pattern is used. With dynamic traffic, the gain is even larger,
close to a 4dB gain even for the most extreme CPC pattern with the smallest
burst size and the longest DTX cycle. There is also an improvement in the
average cell throughput for the dynamic-traffic case.
### 5.4.3 Grant handling
#### 5.4.3.1 Analysis
The motivation for introducing a grant handling enhancement is to avoid the
drawbacks with operating a bursty high data rate traffic using legacy E-AGCH
channel. The main drawbacks are:
  * The need for signalling two E-AGCH\'s, one for starting and one for > stopping data transmissions, which is explained in detail below.
  * Serious consequences for missed detection of the terminating grant.
> \- Flexibility, e.g. ability to operate without TTI gaps between users.
The TDM scheduling can be realized in the currently working system, however
the signalling overhead is significant. To begin the TDM operation all but one
UE in a cell have to receive the ZERO-grant command. It is assumed that in the
TDM mode the Node B has to nominate one UE which will transmit for the next
period, while the UE transmitting in the previous period has to be informed
that it has to stop the transmission. For that 2 commands have to be issued:
1 E-AGCH with either ZERO, INACTIVE
2 E-AGCH with Absolute Grant Value for a UE nominated to transmit in the next
period.
The signalling message flow required to perform the TDM operation is presented
in Figure 5.4.3.1-1.
{width="3.933333333333333in" height="3.4569444444444444in"}
Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Legacy grant signalling for the TDM operation
The main disadvantage of this approach is that after sending the ZERO-grant to
currently transmitting UE one TTI is lost (no UE transmitting with a high
bitrate in the next TTI) before the next UE receives and applies new absolute
grant. This reduces gains coming from the TDM scheduling. Reversing steps 1
and 2 would lead to a situation where two UEs transmit simultaneously with
high grants for at least one TTI before one of them receives and applies the
ZERO-grant. This would cause very high interference for both transmissions and
also to the neighbouring cells.
#### 5.4.3.2 Solutions
To avoid the drawbacks with the legacy Absolute Grant signalling following
alternatives could be considered:
\- Time limited grants: A new E-AGCH-like grant channel, for enabling time
limited grants
\- Grant detection: A new grant signalled to one UE to implicitly, by means of
detecting a message with incorrect CRC on the grant channel, be interpreted as
a stop-command for the other UE(s) currently actively transmitting.
\- Fast scheduling grants: A new E-RGCH-like for separating scheduling from
link adaptation.
\- New E-AGCH timing for deactivation: A new timing for E-AGCH based grant
deactivation enable the granted UE to be switched without a gap in
transmission by using only one E-AGCH channel.
In addition, considering more than one UE may need to be scheduled at a given
time to be able to fill the available RoT headroom in power/buffer limited
situations and to be able to benefit from IC receivers, design options should
consider to support more than one UE scheduled at a given time.
##### 5.4.3.2.1 Time-Limited Grant (TG)
A Time-Limited Grant (TG) is similar to an Absolute Grant (AG) but with an
additional field indicating the number of TTI for which the grant is valid.
The main purpose is to avoid the scheduling gap mentioned above for the
baseline Absolute Grant.
{width="3.801388888888889in" height="3.5840277777777776in"}
Figure 5.4.3.2.1-1: An example illustrating the use of TG for\ allocating
transmission occasions in TDM operation
Figure 5.4.3.2.1-1 shows a simplified example of how a 4-TTI TG works. The
network listens to the SI sent by the UEs when data transmission begins to
decide which UE should be given a TG. TGs are then sent on the new grant
channel, labelled as E-TGCH. For UE 1 in the figure, the TG is not renewed by
the network, possibly due to a low buffer status. The TG of UE 2 is also not
renewed because UE 3 has arrived and it needs to be prioritized in the
scheduling. Note that some or all of the UEs may be given a TG of a longer or
shorter duration depending on the need.
Unintended or unexpected transmissions or retransmissions in TDM operation can
lead to collisions that are not resolved until HARQ failures occur for the
UEs. When regular AGs are used, unexpected transmissions can result from
missed detection of a transmission-terminating AG (e.g., the ZERO_GRANT)
Unexpected retransmissions can be due to missed ACKs on the E-HICH or missed
detection of a prior E-DCH transmission or re-transmission. For these reasons,
in addition to the use of TGs for first transmissions, HARQ retransmissions
are proposed to be granted using a TG.
The grant handling for retransmission can be more complicated than the example
given in Figure 5.4.3.2.1-1.\ When switching between two UEs, as it is the
case between UE 2 and 3 above, the network cannot grant a particular TTI to a
new UE until it is sure that the previous UE will not perform a HARQ
retransmission. The network can either prioritize a retransmission by granting
the new user one TTI at a time or it can delay a retransmission until the next
occasion. In the case that the UE does not receive a grant for a
retransmission, to simplify the handling, the UE considers the retransmission
executed, i.e., increment the RSN by 1 and keep the data in the HARQ buffer
according to the baseline. Figure 5.4.3.2.1-2 shows the timing relation of the
baseline E-AGCH with respect to the E-DCH. The same timing relation is
proposed for the new grant channel.
> {width="8.254166666666666in" height="2.3868055555555556in"}
Figure 5.4.3.2.1-2: Timing of the E-AGCH and the new grant channel\ with
respect to the E-DCH and related channels
In Figure 5.4.3.2.1-2 a TG is transmitted at (SFN, subframe) = (0, 0), which
triggered 4 TTIs of data transmissions from (0, 0) to (0, 3) on the E-DCH. If
not ACK\'ed, the data will have to be retransmitted, in (1,3) to (2,1). Note
that the HARQ feedback for the previous data transmission for a HARQ process
and the grant for the next transmission for the same HARQ process have the
same timing so that it is possible for the network to decide whether to grant
a retransmission or a new transmission for another UE.
As mentioned, the design of the new grant channel follows that of the E-AGCH
with the same channel structure and the same timing relations. Since the TDM
operation is often intended for higher rates, fewer bits are needed to signal
the grant value. The saved bits can then be used for signalling the grant
duration. Thus the only change required is the re-interpretation of the bits
sent on the E-AGCH.
##### 5.4.3.2.2 Grant detection
In HSUPA all active UEs monitor the E-AGCH channel. When a transmission occurs
each UE tries to decode the grant message by performing a CRC check with its
E-RNTI. If a UE successfully decodes the grant it starts the grant update
procedure. It is proposed that all other TDM UEs who receive an E-AGCH
transmission which is not intended for them (the CRC check fails)
automatically set their Serving Grants to zero. This way a single E-AGCH
command would provide an absolute grant for one UE and at the same time
"silence" other UEs in the cell. The mentioned E-AGCH channel for TDM UEs
could be transmitted using dedicated OVSF code. This would ensure that grant
signalling to legacy UEs would not interfere with the described approach.
The proposed solution saves signalling overhead as only one signalling message
is needed every scheduling period. It also solves the problem of lost TTI
between steps 1 and 2 in the Figure 5.4.3.1-1. The solution doesn\'t require
new signalling channel design. Instead, the legacy E-AGCH channel can be used.
This raises a question whether a reliable detection of the E-AGCH transmission
dedicated to another UE is possible without knowing the E-RNTI of that UE. Two
errors that might occur are false alarm (UE detects the E-AGCH which is not
present) and missed detection (UE doesn\'t detect the valid E-AGCH
transmission). A simple link level simulation has been performed and is shown
in Annex B.1.1.1. The simulations prove that the E-AGCH presence can be
detected with high probability by other means than the CRC check.
One potential disadvantage of Grant Detection is scheduling only one UE at the
time. In some cases a single UE may not be capable of utilizing whole RoT
budget. That would lead to underutilization of resources unless another UE is
scheduled at the same time to fill the remaining RoT margin. Scheduling of
more than one UE can also help to utilize the capability of the successive
interference cancelling receivers. One solution to this problem is to use the
legacy E-AGCH to schedule additional UE(s). As mentioned before, the TDM
operating UEs could use the E-AGCH channel transmitted on a dedicated OVSF
code to allow coexistence with the legacy scheduling. It means that new UEs
could monitor both new and legacy E-AGCHs and use also the legacy one to
receive additional grants. The legacy E-AGCH cannot operate in the Grant
Detection mode but it would be used only to provide additional flexibility to
the Grant Detection scheme. A simplified illustration for this operation is
presented below.
{width="6.506944444444445in" height="3.7020833333333334in"}
Figure 5.4.3.2.2-1: Scheduling multiple UEs using Grant Detection and legacy
E-AGCH
Figure 5.4.3.2.2-1 presents example operation of a cell with 4 TDM UEs. When
UE4 receives an Absolute Grant sent using the E-AGCH on a dedicated OVSF code
it uses the grant value to update its Serving Grant and starts the
transmission with the updated power level. Simultaneously other UEs detect
this message being sent without decoding it and automatically stop their
transmissions. Additionally, UE2 is scheduled using the legacy E-AGCH
scheduling. This grant is sent using the legacy E-AGCH so it doesn\'t stop the
transmission of UE4. When the Node B scheduler decides to schedule next UE it
uses the Grant Detection channel again. This approach saves signalling
overhead as there is no need to prolong the Absolute Grant in every TTI in
which a UE is supposed to transmit. The grant is sent only once per scheduling
period per UE so the longer the scheduling period the more overhead is saved.
Another advantage of this solution is that the scheduler doesn\'t have to know
the scheduling period when assigning a grant to a UE. The Node B can decide
very dynamically on switching UEs taking into account instantaneous buffer and
interference situation.
##### 5.4.3.2.3 Fast Scheduling Grant
An alternative proposal for TDM scheduling signalling is separating the link
adaptation from the scheduling information. The link adaptation which
corresponds to granted transmission power can still be signalled using legacy
methods utilizing E-AGCH or E-RGCH but new signalling method is required to
signal the allocation of subframes for specific UEs. From this on we call such
signalling Fast Scheduling Grant (FSG). When fast scheduling grant is used the
UE follows the serving grant value signalled using legacy methods but
transmits data only when it has received FSG showing that the UE has
permission to transmit in the particular TTI. The FSG does not necessarily
have to signal scheduling grant only for one TTI at a time but it can actually
be combined with the other proposals on improved grant handling.
FSG can be signalled e.g. by re-using either E-AGCH or E-RGCH. Re-using E-RGCH
as illustrated in Figure 5.4.3.2.3-1 seems more favourable. In this method a
new signature should be reserved for the FSG for each UE. This signature could
be in the same code channel as the legacy E-RGCH. Benefits of this signalling
are obvious, it does not require UE to receive a new code channel and it does
not require transmitting E-AGCH any more often as in legacy system. Also there
is no unnecessary data to be transmitted; signatures for UEs that are not
actively allocated are not transmitted.
{width="5.15in" height="2.0868055555555554in"}
Figure 5.4.3.2.3-1. Re-using E-RGCH for fast scheduling grant
Simplest form of FSG is such that if a UE is scheduled, the FSG signature is
transmitted mapped to symbol \"1\". If a UE is not scheduled, the FSG
signature is transmitted mapped to symbol \"DTX\". Upon detecting the FSG
symbol equal to \"1\" the UE can then start transmitting TTIs. In the most
dynamic case each TTI is scheduled separately but alternative approach can be
used for less dynamic scheduling where grant is applicable to a UE for a pre-
determined time. However, since the E-RGCH signature only carries one
information bit the duration would need to be configured by higher layers.
Another possible approach is switching grant on and off by still using the
same FSG signalling. This can also be easily obtained by using ternary
signalling structure in the legacy E-RGCH. Interpretation of the transmitted
signal can be e.g.:
\- \"1\" scheduling grant given to UE
\- \"-1\" scheduling grant cancelled
\- \"DTX\" no change in grant
A benefit with this scheme is that supporting more than one scheduled UE at
the time does not require any extra channelization code allocation. Different
operating point, i.e. missed detection target, compared to E-RGCH may be
desirable for the efficient system operation and it can be achieved as shown
by the evaluation in the Annex B.1.1.2.
##### 5.4.3.2.4 New E-AGCH timing for deactivation
Shown in Figure 5.4.3.2.4-1, AG for UE1 deactivation will take effect in E-DCH
TTI1. AG for UE2 activation will take effect in E-DCH TTI2. Therefore, a gap
in E-DCH TTI1 is introduced.
Figure 5.4.3.2.4-1: gap description using legacy E-AGCH
In order to solve the time gap problem described above, we redefine the E-AGCH
taking effect time when it is used for deactivation. E-AGCH used for
deactivation UE takes effect one TTI earlier than its legacy time. As shown in
Figure 5.4.3.2.4-2, AG for UE2 activation takes effect in E-DCH TTI1, the same
timing with legacy. AG used for UE1 deactivation takes effect in E-DCH TTI1
too, one TTI earlier than its legacy time TTI2. By using this new timing,
there is no gap between users when switching happens.
In addition, deactivation requires no data preparation (such as E-TFC
selection, transport channel processing etc.) in UE side, thus the proposed
scheme has very little influence on the UE process capability.
Figure 5.4.3.2.4-2: new E-AGCH timing for deactivation
Due to this scheme the timing specified in TS 25.214 [20] will be changed.
Currently one UE can only be configured by one E-AGCH channel. However, Node B
can configure more than one E-AGCH channels to support more than one UE. If
only one new UE is activated in one TTI and other activated UEs still remain
activated, only one E-AGCH is needed to support multiuser scheduling.
Moreover, when more than one new UE are activated at the same time, more
E-AGCH channels are needed to support multiuser scheduling. This is a simple
method to support multiuser in TDM scheduling.
The TDM scheduling is supported when Multi- E-AGCHs are used and meanwhile new
E-AGCH timing is used.
### 5.4.4 Deployment scenarios for Lean carrier
#### 5.4.4.1 Analysis
The benefit of deploying Lean carriers depends on the nature of the traffic
and the available spectrum in the network. The following scenarios have been
identified:
\- Data-heavy networks: This is the main scenario where Lean carriers are most
beneficial.
\- Speech-heavy networks: Depending on the available spectrum, Lean carrier
deployment may or may not be beneficial during busy hours. During off-hours,
when more spectrum is available for data services, Lean carrier is a
possibility.
\- Spare spectrum during off-hours: In addition to the normal Lean carrier
gain, this scenario also provides energy saving opportunity for the network by
using DL DTX when there is temporarily no traffic in a cell.
\- Under-utilized Lean carrier: A hybrid version that supports both legacy and
Lean carrier operations may be used instead of an under-utilized Lean carrier.
Under-utilization is then reduced, but the gain from Lean carrier operations
is also impacted. An increased number of inter-frequency handovers between the
Lean carrier and the primary \"regular\" carrier, for legacy UEs not
supporting DC-HSUPA, may also have an impact on latency and reliability.
The main scenario which should be primarily considered is of course the first
scenario of Data-heavy networks. Data traffic volume is much higher than
speech volume in most networks and ratio of data traffic is growing with time.
### 5.4.5 Mobility
#### 5.4.5.1 Analysis
In Rel-9 DC-HSUPA mobility the UE performs mobility measurements even when the
secondary carrier is deactivated, if measurements are configured.
#### 5.4.5.2 Solutions
Depending on the network, mobility measurements may not be configured on the
Lean carrier. Mobility can still be maintained using the primary carrier and
secondary active sets and serving cells can be maintained by mirroring those
on the primary carrier. The primary option is that only the serving cell is
kept on the secondary carrier. One other alternative could be that when the UE
is transmitting on the secondary carrier the network has the option to
instruct the UE to listen, or not to listen, to non-serving cells for RGs and
TPC commands.
### 5.4.6 Conclusions
Under the sub-topic "enabling higher bit rates" of this study item
improvements for increasing the system performance on uplink single and multi-
carriers have been studied. A Lean carrier concept and different TDM
scheduling schemes have been proposed. Simulations have been performed for
evaluating the potential gains of the Lean carrier and the specific schemes
enabling improved TDM scheduling.
#### 5.4.6.1 Conclusions on grant handling
It was recognized that the time division multiplexing (TDM) operation can
bring significant gains in HSUPA system. The existing Serving Grant signalling
procedure is limited in a way that it cannot facilitate efficient TDM
operation. In the Table 5.4.6.1-1 below results for solutions improving grant
signalling were obtained and compared with the legacy TDM and CDM procedures.

Different grant handling mechanisms have been studied for improved TDM
scheduling. The Grant detection approach saves signalling overhead compared to
other schemes which might need repetitive granting. In order to schedule
multiple users simultaneously an additional grant channel introduction was
presented as one of possible solution.\ This also requires the UE to listen to
multiple E-AGCH and a need for an E-AGCH DTX detection mechanism in the UE. It
was proven by the LLS evaluation there is no risk of false detection of the
E-AGCH DTX.
A benefit of the FSG (Fast Scheduling Grant) scheme can be that it is possible
to schedule multiple UE\'s in the same TTI with a single channelization code
allocation. Although other schemes can handle multiple UE\'s transmitting
simultaneously, the scheduling cannot be done in the same TTI without
allocating multiple E-AGCH channelization codes and requiring UE\'s to monitor
them. With FSG switching scheduling grant off arbitrarily using signalling is
slightly more complicated, an additional FSG needs to be signalled separately
but due to low overhead that is not a problem. There is also a considerable
risk for false detections of RGCH\'s which cause the transmissions from UE\'s
to collide with each other, compared to the consequence of false detection of
legacy RGCH which will just step the grant up or down one step. An implicit
assumption for FSG is that the grant value is not changed frequently. In
situations where a new grant value is needed for each user, this scheme has an
additional overhead in the RG.
Another scheme which improves TDM scheduling is the time limited grants idea,
where the legacy E-AGCH is used but the bits sent on the E-AGCH are re-
interpreted. Since TDM scheduling is mainly intended for high data-rates, one
proposal is to restrict grant signalling to a reduced set of grant values
using fewer bits. The remaining bits can then be used for signalling the grant
duration. If a UE wants to end his transmission before that granted time an
additional terminating grant needs to be transmitted. The benefit of the
solution with new E-AGCH timing for deactivation is also the simplicity.
However the consequences of changing the deactivation timing of the E-AGCH
have not been studied. Also an additional deactivation needs to be signalled,
the overhead of deactivation signalling can be substantial when many small
bursts scheduled.
Summary of grant handling schemes is shown in Table 5.4.6.1-2. The E-AGCH
based grant schemes could require more frequent E-AGCH transmission increasing
power consumption of the E-AGCH channel; however this might not be an issue in
TDM scheduling scenarios.

An improved grant handling mechanism is an essential part of the Lean carrier
concept.\ Though standalone grant handling schemes for improved TDM scheduling
on a single carrier can be envisioned.
#### 5.4.6.2 Conclusions on Lean carrier
The Lean secondary carrier provides a solution where the DPCCH bursts from CPC
operation are eliminated when the UE is not transmitting any data on the
secondary uplink carrier. Simulation results have been provided for studying
the impact of the interference created by the CPC bursts on data transmissions
and the impact of the interference from data transmissions on the DPCCH
bursts. The Lean carrier operation is not compatible with legacy users. In
case of a hybrid scenario supporting both Lean carrier capable UEs and legacy
UEs, a loss can be expected in legacy UEs performance, e.g. broadÂ­cast
channels are still needed, scheduling delay is increased for high-bitrate
transmissions and SI transmission delay may be increased
The link level simulation results have shown link level gains of Lean carrier
over legacy CPC in these high rate bursty traffic scenarios when DPCCH SIR
based ILPC was used. ILPC target at received DPCCH SNR instead of SINR was
investigated. Limited gain for Lean carrier over CPC was observed in these
simulations and in case of two interfering CPC bursts and DPCCH SNR target
equal to -19dB the difference in performance was negligible.
The simulations results on Lean carrier presented in Appendix B.1.1.2 and
B.1.1.3 compare the Lean carrier performance with a baseline using CPC. The
link-level results show that the interference created by DPCCH bursts is
important when transmissions are scheduled at medium and higher data-rates. An
impact on performance is observed when the DPCCH bursts are interfered by data
transmissions. This impact increases with the number of DPCCH bursts between
data transmissions.
Different CPC settings result in different interference levels created by the
DPCCH bursts. For one evaluated setting, 100 users activated on a secondary
carrier amount to an average of just 1.25 continuous DPCCH. The performance
between Lean and CPC is very similar in this case for large and frequent data
transmissions. When applied to bursty small data transmissions, the
performance deteriorates. It should also be noted that the current
specifications do not allow different CPC patterns to be used for the primary
and the secondary carrier for the same UE, but it is possible to deactivate
the secondary uplink carrier with HS-SCCH order. The extreme CPC setting,
however, does not seem to have much effect on the performance loss due to
high-bitrate data transmissions interfering with the DPCCH bursts.
These system simulation results show that with dynamic traffic, the difference
in average RoT between Lean carrier and the CPC cases are more pronounced than
with a fixed transmission pattern. At a very high load of 100 user/cell, a 4dB
lower RoT can be achieved even when compared to the most extreme CPC case with
the shortest possible burst size and the longest possible cycle length.
Improvement in average cell throughput is also seen. The simulation was
conducted without RoT control, and the active user was always scheduled with 5
Mbps instantaneous data rate.
Considering the traffic model used, the system reaches 100% TTI utilization at
around 25 users with user data rates close to 160 kbps on average, and with
100 users the UE throughout degrades to 40 kbps on average. Below the 25
users/cell loading point a small reduction in observed RoT was seen for the
same average cell throughput for Lean carrier over CPC.
The reduced transmission of DPCCH on the secondary carrier results in less
overall Noise Rise in the system (reduced UL control channel overhead).Lean
carrier may not be operable in SHO region due to TDM operation assumed. Due to
mobility, before a UE can resume Lean carrier operation in a new cell its
radio link timing needs to be reconfigured, which may lead to flushing of UL
HARQ buffers.

Impacts on implementation
1 Transmitter at UE side\ DPCCH is only transmitted together with data
transmissions with/without preamble. For the case of long data transmission
gap, the initial DPCCH Tx power of Lean carrier may be calculated via the
initial DPCCH power of the primary carrier plus a configurable power margin,
similar to the activation of legacy secondary carrier at each E-DCH
transmission.\ Some traffic will be moved to the primary carrier, e.g. SI,
SRB, since only PS traffics are allowed on the secondary carrier in Lean
carrier operation. In addition, PRACH is not allowed to be used, since UE is
not allowed to anchor on the cell supporting Lean carrier, resulting that only
one carrier can be anchored in the network deployment.
2 Transmitter at UTRAN side\ New grant procedures may be introduced for
improved TDM scheduling, e.g. new grant channel, new grant detection
procedures, two grant channels or new grant timing (smaller gap of
deactivation).
## 5.5 Reduced UL control channel overhead
### 5.5.1 Background and motivation
This part of the report is concerned with identifying the scenarios where it
could be beneficial to reduce the uplink control channel overhead. Increased
data capacity could either allow increased rates or increased number of users
in the cell. In Rel-7, DPCCH discontinuous transmission was introduced to
reduce the uplink control channel overhead in case of low uplink data
transmission activity (e.g. web browsing). When there is temporarily no E-DCH
transmission, DPCCH transmits discontinuously according to a pattern. This is
a way to limit the control channel overhead during UE inactivity periods. To
further improve cell capacity and coverage it is also worth studying reduced
UL control channel overhead in the cases when uplink data transmission is on-
going. Therefore, various approaches on control channel overhead optimization
are investigated in Release 12. These approaches may include:
\- Reducing the power or DTX of E-DPCCH
\- Reducing the power or DTX of HS-DPCCH
\- optimizing the DTX mechanisms of DPCCH
### 5.5.2 Analysis
The CQI is the key indicator for HSDPA downlink (DL) channel quality and its
frequent reporting is essential to maintain a good DL efficiency. The UE
estimates the channel from the CPICH, and computes the channel quality
information. This information along with HARQ ACK/NAK is reported to Node-B
using HS-DPCCH and its periodicity is configured by RRC signalling. The
structure of HS-DPCCH for a single carrier, when the UE is configured in non
MIMO mode, is shown in Figure 5.5.2-1.
Figure 5.5.2-1: Frame structure for uplink HS-DPCCH
Node-B receives the CQI and allocates the required channelization codes,
modulation and transport block size, pre-coding channel index (in MIMO mode),
to the UE. This information is conveyed to the UE by HS-SCCH. Once the UE
detects the HS-SCCH, downlink transmission starts. The reporting period
impacts the downlink performance as well as the UE power consumption. If the
reporting period is small the CQI quality is good, however the frequent
signalling consumes UE power. On the other hand, if the reporting period is
fixed to a large value, the CQI is outdated and the downlink throughput may be
reduced.
The E-DPCCH carries the E-TFCI, RSN and Happy bit, and is always transmitted
along with E-DPDCH. If the E-DPCCH could be transmitted at a reduced power or
be totally avoided in certain time periods, the overall UL control channel
overhead could be reduced. The reduction of E-DPCCH transmission is not
considered when E-DPCCH boosting is used.
### 5.5.3 Solutions
#### 5.5.3.1 Description of CQI cycle adaptive solution
Currently a single CQI reporting pattern is defined for HSDPA in multi-RAB
scenario (HSPA coexistence with R99 channel, e.g., the UE receives downlink
data (PS data) traffic and simultaneously has an active speech connection (CS
data) established). In order to reduce HS-DPCCH channel overhead, the second
CQI reporting pattern is defined additionally. Normally, the UE reports CQI
using the first reporting pattern, i.e., transmits a CQI report once every C1
ms. If the UE has not been scheduled for a certain (configurable) period T,
the UE switches to a second CQI reporting pattern, i.e., reports CQI every C2
ms, where C2>C1.
Note that the CQI reporting patterns as a special case may include switching
off the reporting completely (basically setting C2 to infinity). One
possibility to implement this is to (re)start one DL activity timer in the UE
every time HS-DSCH data, an HS-SCCH order or any other signalling indication
is received. If the activity timer expires, the UE switches from pattern1 to
pattern2. The DL activity timer detects when it would be appropriate to reduce
or completely stop the CQI transmission in the UL by monitoring the DL
activity. The Node B may use a corresponding activity timer mechanism (one per
UE) to determine whether to expect pattern1 or pattern2.
In order not to impact on HSDPA transmission, Node B could activate UE to
report CQI at any time by physical signalling, e.g., by HS-SCCH order. Once
the activation order is received by the UE, the UE would then immediately
transmit CQI and (re)start the activity timer. UE reports CQI according to
pattern1 when the activity timer is running, and UE reports CQI according to
pattern2 when the activity timer expires.
To implement the above mechanism, RNC needs to configure the CQI reporting
intervals C1, C2 and DL activity period for both UE and Node B
#### 5.5.3.2 Evaluation of CQI cycle adaptive solution
From the UE perspective, the transmission of the CQI on HS-DPCCH consumes
valuable power headroom which can be better utilized by DPDCH or E-DPDCH for
increasing performance in power limited scenarios. From the network
perspective, reducing the CQI reports would reduce uplink interference as well
as improve cell capacity.
**Baseline:** When E-DCH and DPDCH are scheduled for transmission (Multi-
RABs), CPC does not work in this scenario.
**Timer_1:** Time_1 is the pre-defined time interval. Timer_1 is 8ms, 16ms, or
32ms.
System simulation results are provided in Figure 5.5.3.2-1 and Figure
5.5.3.2-2 using the cycle adaptive solution, assuming that the CQI report is
not activated by HS-SCCH order before data transmission. Figure 5.5.3.2-1
shows the average burst rate in Mbps and Figure 5.5.3.2-2 shows the percentage
of average burst rate gain. In UL, it can be seen that there are about 36% to
43% gains in average burst rate for the cycle adaptive solution. Gains in UE
throughput are from 12% to 13%. The UL performance gains are mainly due to the
uplink power saving if the UE switches to a different CQI cycle in case of no
downlink transmission. In DL, there are about 6% to 9% losses, which might be
caused by the relatively poor CQI accuracy since Node B has to rely on long
cycle CQI reporting for the first TTIs of DL scheduling before UE switches to
short cycle CQI reporting.

#### 5.5.3.3 Description of CQI report reduction for multi-RABs with speech
solution
CQI reports are signalled also when a UE is configured for Multi-RAB, where it
receives downlink data (PS data) traffic and simultaneously has an active
speech connection (CS data) established. In a power-limited scenario, the UE
may not have sufficient uplink transmit power to keep a desired level of
uplink services. If a power-limited UE in Multi-RAB has stopped receiving
downlink data (PS data) traffic, for example because of empty downlink data
buffers, the CQI reports transmitted on the HS-DPCCH become a liability since
they are taking power away from the DPCCH and the speech (CS data) and/or SRB
traffic on the DPDCH. Avoiding or reducing the HS-DPCCH transmission in these
scenarios would result in increased power for DCH channels and in turn
improved coverage. It would therefore be desirable to avoid unnecessary CQIs
under these power-limited scenarios. One solution is to stop CQI reporting
after a certain period of DL data inactivity. Another solution could be to
keep some reduced level of CQI reporting.
One method to detect when it would be appropriate to reduce or completely stop
the CQI transmission in UL, and when it is appropriate to have \'normal\' CQI
transmission, is to introduce a DL inactivity timer. The DL inactivity timer
shall monitor the DL data inactivity and after a certain period of DL
inactivity trigger reduced CQI reporting. At least one parameter need to be
introduced for this feature, the Time for the inactivity timer (Time values).
Recovered DL activity will trigger normal CQI reporting.
A solution using variable CQI reporting period, if a certain level of CQI
reports still are desired, can be achieve by introducing a parameter for
reduced CQI reporting cycle. This parameter will signal values for reduced
reporting cycle, e.g., x/2, x/4, etc. One of the included values can be 0,
corresponding to no reporting.
One option can be to reduce the CQI reporting period when there is no DL
transmission, even if the UE is not power limited. This can for example be
controlled by a parameter which decides if CQI report reduction should be
initiated depending on UE power headroom condition or not.
#### 5.5.3.4 Evaluation of CQI report reduction for multi-RABs with speech
solution
Currently HS-DPCCH is a liability when a UE configured for Multi-RAB is power-
limited and is not receiving any downlink data (PS data) traffic. The HS-DPCCH
is taking power away from the DPCCH and the speech (CS data) and/or SRB
traffic on the DPDCH. Reducing the CQI reports in the mentioned scenarios
would enhance coverage. This solution is in general similar to the CQI cycle
adaptive solution except that it only focuses on the CQI reduction in power
limited Multi-RAB scenarios for improving speech coverage.
#### 5.5.3.5 Description of Serving Grant based E-DPCCH less solution
The E-DPCCH transmission could be avoided (E-DPCCH less mode) if the following
criteria are satisfied by the UE:
1 The E-DPDCH transmission is not HARQ retransmission
2 The UE is neither buffer limited nor power limited
In order to allow Node B to distinguish E-DPCCH less transmission from no
E-DCH data, UE should not enter E-DPCCH less mode until the ACK for the first
E-DPDCH transmission is received during a certain period. When the UE buffer
is empty, SI=0 is triggered which informs Node B that the UE has no data for
transmission, and the UE exits the E-DPCCH less mode.
When E-DPCCH is not transmitted, Node B can deduce the TB size of E-DPDCH
transmission according to the Serving Grant allocated to the UE.
The above operation is illustrated in Figure 5.5.3.5-1.
Figure 5.5.3.5-1: Serving Grant based E-DPCCH less
#### 5.5.3.6 Evaluation of Serving Grant based E-DPCCH less solution
Most of the time E-DPCCH transmission could be avoided, since HARQ
retransmissions does not always happen and Node B could always allocate an
appropriate Serving Grant to the UE based on the SI report to avoid the buffer
limitation and power limitation.
In case E-DPCCH less is enabled, both the average UE throughput and sector
throughput are improved. The increase of UE throughput rate is mainly because
more power can be allocated to E-DPDCH transmission due to the E-DPCCH
transmission decrease. In case of a high load scenario, the increase of UE
throughput can be translated into sector throughput gain.
E-DPCCH will not be avoided in case of E-DPCCH boosting. However, considering
that the gain for E-DPCCH less operation is expected in the scenario of a
large number of users continuously are transmitting at relatively low data
rates, the E-DPCCH boosting will not impact the gain for E-DPCCH less
operation evidently.
In soft handover the E-DPCCH may need to be transmitted always as neither the
serving nor the non-serving Node B would be able to rely on knowing what the
UE\'s maximum grant is.
The loss of happy-bits could cause some delays in the Node B scheduler
operation, or alternatively the UE could transmit E-DPCCH if it is unhappy or
if the status of the happy bit is changed.
Errors in grant signalling could lead to mismatch between the UE\'s and Node
B\'s understanding of the maximum grant, and lead to loss of multiple initial
transmission attempts until the Node B is able to detect the issue and send
the UE a new absolute grant resolving the mismatch. This can lead to a lot of
HARQ failures and RLC re-transmissions.
Baseband implementation complexity can also be expected with this scheme, so
the potential increased complexity must be taken into account when evaluating
gains.
System simulation results for E-DPCCH less operation with 2,6,10 users per
cell are presented in Table 5.5.3.6-1 to Table 5.5.3.6-3. The corresponding UE
throughput and RoT CDFs are given in Annex B.2.1 The simulation assumptions
are listed in Table A.2.2-1 in Annex A.2.2
Simulation results in Tables 5.5.3.6-1-3 show that gains from 6% to 17% in UE
burst rate are achieved when the number of UEs increases from 6 to 10\. The
gain in burst rate is mainly because more power can be allocated to\ E-DPDCH
transmission due to the reduced E-DPCCH transmission. However, when the number
of UEs is 2, there is a small loss of -0.3% in UE burst rate. One explanation
is that with a small number of users, it is more likely that the UEs are
transmitting at higher rates and therefore boosting is used. If boosting is
used, E-DPCCH less operation is not enabled. The average RoT is close to the
RoT target, which means that the simulated scenario can be regarded as high
load scenario where the increase in UE burst rate can be translated into
sector throughput gain.

#### 5.5.3.7 Description of blind E-DPDCH detection solution
Normally, small packet over HSPA (for example, VOIP or CS over HSPA) is
transmitted with fixed formats or predefined transport format(s), then the
E-DPDCH could be sent without E-DPCCH, and Node B could decode the E-DPDCH
blindly. In order to make Node B distinguish original transmissions from re-
transmission, the original transmissions can be sent without the E-DPCCH,
while for the HARQ processes with retransmissions the E-DPCCH is present.
Another solution is that the transport format is fixed or consisting of a
subset of the possible TBs, where the requirement for the subset is that the
Node B needs to be able to blindly detect what is being sent. Then for that
service with predefined transport format(s), the E-DPCCH is not transmitted
for the first HARQ attempt. For the HARQ processes with retransmissions the
E-DPCCH is transmitted so that Node B is aware that it is a retransmission.
#### 5.5.3.8 Evaluation of blind E-DPDCH detection solution
The solution would mostly benefit scenarios where a large number of users are
transmitting with a small set of recurring transport formats, such as VoIP,
and in extending the coverage of the minimum data rate when used to eliminate
E-DPCCH from the smallest TB size(s) only and enabling the UE to use the saved
power headroom on E-DPDCH. The E-DPCCH could for example be eliminated from
the minimum set E-TFC. Notably, when the E-TFCs that need to be blindly
detected are known a priori, the solution is applicable in soft handover as
well. The blind detection of the E-DPDCH will result in some additional
computational complexity in the Node B.
The loss of happy bits would not cause problems in either of the
abovementioned use cases, as with VoIP the UE would not have any need to
indicate it is unhappy if the service was not configured as non-scheduled, and
when the UE is power limited it could not indicate unhappiness with the
current grant.
#### 5.5.3.9 Description of reduced E-TFCI solution
An alternative solution is to reduce the E-TFCI information which is currently
carried using 7 bits. This has been already considered in Rel-7 when it was
identified that the E-TFCI constitutes a significant overhead that can be
optimized. It was proposed to reduce the E-TFCI information from 7 to 4 bits
for operation with low data rates where "E-TFCI" info does not vary
dynamically over time but rather shows constant or within restricted range. In
that case a new coding of E-DPCCH, e.g. Reed-Muller code RM(30,7) as proposed
in [6], would have to be used. This has been taken further in [8] where it is
proposed to completely remove the E-TFCI information for small packets and use
blind detection of E-TFCI by the Node B. The RM(30,3) coding of the E-DPCCH
channel is proposed to be used in this case. The figures below illustrate the
overall coding chain for the E-DPCCH for two of embodiments of the Reed--
Muller code, RM(30,10) which is currently used and RM(30,3).

Reed-Muller code RM(30,10) and RM(30,3).
#### 5.5.3.10 Evaluation of reduced E-TFCI solution
The main benefits of RM(30,3) over full elimination of E-DPCCH are the
following:
\- The Node B implementation basing its E-DCH presence detection at least in
part on E-DPCCH can be reused
\- The Happy-bit is always available for the Node B scheduler
\- Reduced E-DPCCH can also be used with retransmissions
The additional problem for the Node B implementation is that it needs to be
able to blindly detect whether the E-DPCCH is using RM(30,3) or RM(30,10). The
blind detection of the E-DPDCH will result in some additional computational
complexity in the Node B.
### 5.5.4 Conclusions
Different schemes of optimizing uplink control channel overhead were
investigated. As listed in Table 5.5.4-1, system level results for the high UE
densities investigated show that the UE throughput gains were from 12% to 13%
for CQI reduction and from 2% to 7% for E-DPCCH reduction. The results were
obtained assuming an equal RoT CDM scheduler. A different UL scheduling
algorithm may result in different results for E-DPCCH reduction.
Table 5.5.4-1: Gains with control channel overhead reduction
* * *
                       UEs per cell   UE throughput gains   UE burst rate gains
HS-DPCCH reduction 10 12% to 13% 36% to 43% E-DPCCH reduction 6 to 10 2% to 7%
6% to 17%
* * *
HS-DPCCH overhead reduction was considered in context of Multi-RAB, and the
evaluation was done for Multi-RAB. The used baseline CQI feedback rate was 2
ms, and the gains would scale down proportionally if a longer CQI feedback
rate was considered as a baseline. In case of lower UE densities control
channel power constitutes relatively lower overhead and the gains of proposed
improvements are significantly reduced. It should be noted that HS-DPCCH
overhead reduction has a negative impact on the Downlink performance since the
CQI accuracy is reduced. However, the uplink performance gain for the
investigated scenario, a high density of UEs transmitting at low data rates,
is considerably higher than the downlink degradation.
The proposed CQI reduction scheme for power limited Multi-RAB scenarios can be
beneficial for improving speech coverage.
## 5.6 Low-complexity uplink load balancing
### 5.6.1 Background and motivation
Load balancing techniques are employed in cellular systems to overcome the
problems of some cells being congested while others having free resources.
With the load balancing technique applied to the uplink direction, the network
can benefit from multiple cells and distribute UEs between them to equalize
the load. This will facilitate better performance of UEs, and especially of
those ones that do not support multi-carrier in uplink and thus cannot be
assigned dynamically resources over several carriers. At the same time, the
load balancing can be logically extended to a scenario with a UE supporting
two uplink carriers and the network deploying more than two frequencies.
### 5.6.2 Analysis
As per the legacy HSPA behaviour, the uplink \"anchor\" carrier is linked
logically to the corresponding downlink serving cell. It is the responsibility
and the decision of RNC to choose which cell is the serving one for a
particular UE. As a result, some form of the load balancing is already
feasible with the legacy HSPA system by means of switching the serving cell to
a different frequency. This approach, however, involves RNC and thus cannot
perform fast and/or frequent switching between different cells without
compromising application level performance. Thus, a different approach must be
taken that would either avoid interaction with RNC, or minimize it in terms of
reconfiguration process delays.
### 5.6.3 Solutions
#### 5.6.3.1 Load balancing as extended enhanced serving cell change
One approach for implementing the uplink load balancing is to speed up the
serving cell change procedure from one carrier to another, i.e. to speed up
the reconfiguration process that currently involves a number of RRC messages
exchanged between the RNC, and the UE. One way to achieve this is to extend
the Enhanced Serving Cell Change procedure of Release 8\. The eSCC pre-
configuration information for potential target cell has all the major
HSDPA/HSUPA features, and thus the same information container can used for
fast inter-frequency serving cell change eliminating RRC message exchange at
the time of switching, similarly to how the eSCC feature works between cells
within the active set.
The limitation of eSCC is that the corresponding pre-configuration data is
linked to the active set radio links, and it is not possible to provide pre-
configuration for a cell that resides on another frequency. This limitation
can be overcome by introducing the corresponding parameter that would indicate
a frequency where a UE should move. Another difference compared to eSCC is
that an order to switch to a new configuration would be coming from the
serving HS-DSCH cell, as opposed to the target cell identified by the UE in
its measurement report.
Uplink load balancing as an extension to enhanced serving change has the
benefit of re-using as many existing components as possible, with marginal
incremental changes. From the UE implementation perspective, the procedure is
a normal inter-frequency serving cell change, where a new configuration is
pre-configured in advance as in eSCC. All the functional aspects remain
unchanged.
#### 5.6.3.2 Load balancing as extended DC-HSUPA functionality
Another approach for implementing uplink load balancing is to rely upon the
DC-HSUPA functionality. If a UE has the capability to transmit over two UL
carriers simultaneously, then the two carriers are continuously in-synch and
the Node B scheduler can distribute the load and/or to maximize the overall
performance.
The only limitation of the current DC-HSUPA feature is that it is defined only
for 2ms TTI, which was originally motivated by the fact that it was designed
as a high-speed UL feature, not as the UL balancing approach. Thus, for the
cell edge operation, it might be beneficial to consider introducing a new UE
capability that would allow a combination of DC-HSUPA with 10ms TTI. Such an
extension to DC-HSUPA would be very small.
#### 5.6.3.3 Combination of extended eSCC and DC-HSUPA approaches
The approaches based on eSCC and DC-HSUPA can be viewed as complementing each
other. As an example, if DC-HSUPA is extended with a support for 10ms TTI,
then the fast re-configuration mechanism can facilitate fast re-configuration
between 2 and 10ms TTIs as a UE moves from a cell edge to cell centre, and
vice versa. Similarly, if an operator has more than two carriers, then the
fast re-configuration mechanism can also ensure fast switching of the on-going
DC-HSUPA operation to another pair of carriers, or switching DC-HSUPA to the
single-carrier mode on another frequency.
### 5.6.4 Conclusions
During the study, it has been identified that the load balancing as extended
enhanced serving cell change solution may be beneficial. The identified
enhancements, presented in the earlier clauses, would require further studies
to evaluate the benefits compared to existing methods (e.g. timing-maintained
inter-frequency hard handover and\ DC-HSUPA), the network impact and the
overall applicability of the new methods.
## 5.7 Rate adaptation
### 5.7.1 Background and motivation
In the current system we observe post receiver SINR saturation in the high
SINR region due to inter-symbol and inter-stream interference. This causes
inefficiency and instability which can be counter with Rate adaptation.
Additional parameters (i.e. SD parameter) present in the proposed solutions
takes into account post receiver SINR and Rx power disproportionality to
adjust the TBS, enabling more stable operation.
As HSUPA system development is planned in the next versions of the 3GPP
specifications (Release 12 and beyond), introduction of a mechanism for
independent power control and scheduling is seen as one of natural approaches
to boost the system performance. The main ideas of the concept, initial link-
level and system level simulation results have already been presented in 3GPP
[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and [13].
### 5.7.2 Analysis
The power-based scheduling method is referred to the traditional HSUPA
scheduling and E-TFC selection mechanism. For that approach the serving grant
SG simultaneously defines the transmission power level and the E-TFC. The SG
value is selected relative to the current DPCCH power level based on the
available RoT budget. The proportionality of the E-DPDCH post-receiver SINR to
the transmit power level is assumed by the method, where deviations are
compensated by the outer loop power control (OLPC) with increasing or
decreasing the DPCCH SIR target for the internal loop power control (ILPC)
tracking.
As demonstrated by multiple studies [8], [9], [10], [11], [13] the power-based
scheduling becomes inefficient when the post-receiver noise is dominated by
the inter-symbol or inter-stream (in case of CLTD and MIMO transmission)
interference but not the thermal noise.
It should also be mentioned that the WCDMA/HSUPA power control and scheduling
are different from the corresponding procedures in other cellular systems
(like LTE, WiMAX and even HSDPA), where power control and scheduling are done
independently allowing for more flexibility and system efficiency.
### 5.7.3 Solutions
#### 5.7.3.1 Description of novel Rate adaptation mechanisms
In power-based scheduling mode the purpose of OLPC is to compensate the
deviations from the proportionality of SINR increase to TX power increase and
to ensure the necessary BLER performance. For the latter, in SINR-based
scheduling mode, the marginal control loop is introduced in the node B to
adjust the _SD_ parameter based on outcomes of the previous transmissions
(similar principle to the legacy OLPC operation) prior to signaling the
parameter to the UE. The inner and outer loop power control in current
implementation is depicted on Figure 5.7.3.1-1 below:
{width="6.688888888888889in" height="4.145138888888889in"}
Figure 5.7.3.1-1: Inner and outer loop power control in power based approach
By introducing SINR based scheduling method we would like to decouple the
power control and E-TFC selection procedure and by that changing current power
based scheduling approach.
In order to implement these principles, the operation of the SINR-based
scheduling and the associated modified power control procedures for the SIMO
and CLTD modes is defined as follows:
The serving grant _SG_ and SINR difference _SD_ parameters are calculated and
signaled by the Node B to the UE for each TTI. The _SG_ parameter defines the
E-DPDCH power relative to the DPCCH as for the legacy power-based approach. An
illustration of the transmit power level and the _SG_ and _SD_ parameters for
the SINR-based scheduling of a SIMO or CLTD transmission is given in Figure
5.7.3.1-2.
{width="2.2083333333333335in" height="2.2in"}
Figure 5.7.3.1-2: SINR-based scheduling using SG and SD parameters\ for the
SIMO and CLTD transmission modes
E-TFC selection is done using the legacy procedure, but the _SD_ parameter is
applied to decrease the _SG_ grant prior to passing it to the E-TFC. However,
the actual transmit power is not affected by _SD_. The _SD_ is selected so
that the combination of the _SG_ and _SD_ allows the UE to estimate the post-
receiver SINR level at the Node B and select the E-TFC that would provide the
maximum throughput at the required BLER performance. The mechanism considering
2-loop scheme is illustrated on the Figure 5.7.3.1-3 below:
{width="6.6875in" height="3.1555555555555554in"}
Figure 5.7.3.1-3: 2 loop scheme with rate and power loops
Compared to the power-based scheduling, the ILPC is affected by two changes:
\- The subject of tracking is not the DPCCH SIR (Signal-to-Interference ratio)
[8], but the DPCCH (or the total) received power. This change is motivated by
the fact that the proportionality of SINR andTX power increase is no longer
assumed. The power of all other physical channels relative to the DPCCH is
fully defined by the SG parameter and is set the same as for the legacy
operation.
\- The power up/down threshold is no longer the SIR value set by OLPC (which
is therefore disabled in SINR-based scheduling mode), but by the allowed RX
Ec/No budget
Rate adaptation can also be enhanced by a modified 2-loop solution
(illustrated in the Figure 5.7.3.1-3a below) with minor changes compared to
legacy power-based scheduling as:
\- The subject of tracking is not the DPCCH SIR (Signal-to-Interference ratio)
[8], but the DPCCH (or the total) received power.
The modified 2-loop scheme could provide gains in terms of RoT stability by
means of controlling DPCCH or the total received power, and E-TFC selection by
means of signalling T2P dynamically (E-AGCH/E-RGCH) to meet the instantaneous
channel conditions.
Figure 5.7.3.1-3a: A modified 2 loop scheme with modified ILPC and OLPC
It has been proposed that an alternative rate adaptation scheme with 3 loops
could provide additional gains in system performance by the means of having
independent control over the SIR on the control channels. To achieve rate
adaptation with constant received power, data BLER control and DPCCH SINR
control the following measures, incorporating 3 control loops, can be taken:
\- Keep the existing DPCCH SINR-based power control loop.
\- Add a second loop controlling the total received power.
\- Since the SINR for traffic data now will vary due to channel conditions
(ISI) and it will be changes in the fraction of power allocated to overhead
channels, a back-off value applied to the granted rate can be used for
controlling the transmission rate and keeping a desirable HARQ retransmission
rate. This value can be signalled from Node B to UE through a third control
loop.
As shown in Figure 5.7.3.1-5, two fast power control loops are used. The first
power control command is used for increasing/decreasing the DPCCH power. The
second power control command is used for increasing/decreasing the total
power.
Assume that the UE has received commands to change the DPCCH power with a
factor âˆ†P~c~ and that the total power shall change with a factor âˆ†P~s~.
Assuming at slot \"t\" we have the squared beta factors Î²^2^~c~, Î²^2^~ec~,
Î£Î²^2^~ed~(t), corresponding to the relative power of DPCCH, E-DPCCH and
E-DPDCH respectively. One way to model the effect of the power commands is
according to
âˆ†P~c~ P(t)(Î²^2^~c~+ Î²^2^~ec~+ Î£Î²^2^~ed~(t+1)) = âˆ†P~s~P(t)(Î²^2^~c~+ Î²^2^~ec~+
Î£Î²^2^~ed~(t)) (1)
Where P(t) in Equation 1 can be viewed as the power used by DPCCH at time t.
If Î²^2^~c~ = 1 and we denote Î²^2^~sum~=(Î²^2^~c~+ Î²^2^~ec~+ Î£Î²^2^~ed~(t))
Equation 1 can be written as
Î£Î²^2^~ed~(t+1) = Î²^2^~sum~ âˆ†P~s~/âˆ†P~c~ - 1- Î²^2^~ec~ (2)
Equation 2 then describes how Î²~ed~ values are dynamically updated to take the
two power control loop commands into consideration. This is also illustrated
in Figure 5.7.3.1-4.

Figure 5.7.3.1-4: Power relations in the 3-loop scheme
The equations can be extended to also capture E-DPCCH boosting and additional
channels as HS-DPCCH.
The rate offset (SD) calculation shown in Figure 5.7.3.1-5 can be done by the
Node B, based on BLER statistics or SINR measurements. For the BLER controlled
rate offset calculation, if BLER is higher than the desired target then the
offset is lowered, otherwise it is increased. The UE then lowers/increases the
rate but maintains the relative power of data versus control channels.

#### 5.7.3.2 Soft handover operation with Rate adaptation
Using Soft Handover (SHO) with uplink signal reception assisted by the non-
serving Nodes B may be beneficial for transmissions with improved rate
adaptation based on the SINR-based scheduling as it is for the legacy
operation and the power-based scheduling.
In general, different approaches can be envisioned to defining the SHO
operation for the improved rate adaptation. On one side, this is due to some
aspects remaining undefined to the SINR-based scheduling approach itself
(irrespectively of SHO operation). Such important aspect is the power control
scheme (2-loop, 3-loop, modified 2-loop). To address this, the SHO design
aspects specific to a particular power control scheme are treated separately
in the next subclauses along with the corresponding simulation results.
On the other side, multiple design aspects are to be defined specifically for
the SHO with improved rate adaptation and include:
_\- Ability of non-serving Nodes B to decode the data transmitted by SHO UEs_.
Reception of data from SHO UEs by Non-serving Nodes B should be allowed from
the general SHO point of view. However, some options may be envisioned where
SHO operation for the improved rate adaptation will be limited to coordinated
scheduling and power control only (when disabled see results 1a and 1b);
\- Implementation of the rate adaptation procedure at the serving Node B only
or in a collaborative way by Nodes B from the active set at the RNC.
\- In the first case, the E-TFC control mechanism operates only at the serving
Node B similarly to the case of the disabled SHO. Non-serving Nodes B tries to
decode the received TBs but provide only the ACK/NACK feedback without any
impact on the data rate to be scheduled. The marginal loop defining the _SD_
parameter resides in the serving Node B (in results 2a and 2b).
\- In the second (alternative) case, the marginal loop gets TB reception
outcomes at the RNC from all Nodes B in the active set thus taking into
account the combined reception probability. The marginal loop operation for
the latter option is similar to the OLPC operation in the legacy system up to
replacement of the target DPCCH SIR parameter by the E-DPDCH post-receiver
SINR margin (_SD_ parameter) (in results 3a and 3b).
Some SHO design parameters are specific to the power control approach and are
considered in the corresponding subclauses below.
##### 5.7.3.2.1 Soft Handover for 2-loop Rate Adaptation
**The block diagram of the 2-loop power control approach (2-loop rate
adaptation) is shown in Figure 5.7.3.1-3.**
The considered aspect of the SHO procedure specific to the 2-loop power
control approach is the extension of the SHO power control mechanisms. Three
approaches for generation of the ILPC commands from non-serving Node B have
been considered:
_\- TPC commands are only sent from the serving Node B_. The commands from
non-serving Nodes B are either not sent or ignored by the UE (all results
\"a\").
_\- TPC commands from non-serving Nodes B operating like overload indicators._
Non-serving Nodes B uses TPC DOWN commands to indicate that the interference
level from the UE is too high and should be decreased. Otherwise, the UP
commands are sent. The commands from non-serving Nodes B are applied to the
DPCCH power level keeping the legacy procedure of combining TPC commands from
the active set with no modifications (the UE is applying the DOWN command if
any of the commands is DOWN) (all results \"b\").
_\- TPC commands used for equal target RX DPCCH power control at all Nodes B
in the active set_. This option is very close to the legacy SHO operation,
where all cells in the active set transmit TPC commands to the UE. The
difference compared to legacy is that instead of a SIR target, a DPCCH power
target is distributed from RNC to all cells in the active set.
##### 5.7.3.2.2 Soft handover for 3-loop Rate adaptation
The ILPC1 depicted in the lower part of Figure 5.7.3.1-5 adapts DPCCH SIR on a
slot basis using legacy TPC UP/DOWN commands. The ILPC2 in Figure 5.7.3.1-5
adapts the total received power from the UE using total power UP/DOWN
commands. The total received power measurements in Node B can be done by first
measuring the power of the DPCCH. If the Node B is the only cell in the active
set, then by using knowledge of the power commands transmitted to the UE and
the TPC loop delay, the Node B can compute the power offset of the E-DPCCH and
E-DPDCH channels and compute the total received power. This of course requires
that the exact procedure for how the UE recalculates the power of
DPCCH/E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH based on power control commands is well defined.
In the case of soft handover, the UE combines the power control commands (SIR
control and Total received power control) from many Node B\'s. Therefore, in
soft handover, the Node B does not know what power commands the UE actually
has used to derive the new DPCCH/E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH power offsets. In practice
this means that the Node B, instead of relying on knowledge of power offsets,
needs to measure the power of E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH directly.
The following SHO options are proposed for 3-loop scheme:
SHO option 1. ILPC#1 operates (almost) as in legacy scheme, i.e. RNC
determines a target DPCCH SIR value, which is distributed to all cells in the
active set. However, the SIR target is not based on E-DPDCH decoding
performance, but rather the requirement on reliable control channel detection
in the serving cell. The UE combines ILPC#1 commands form all cells as in
legacy operation. ILPC#2 is in the non-serving cells restricted to only
transmit DOWN commands and DTX. This is proposed since the non-serving cell
can no longer control its load by sending relative grants. The rate offset
calculation can in this simplest option be made in the serving Node B only.
SHO option 2. Same as SHO option 1 but where the rate offset calculation is
done in RNC based on decoding performance in all cells.
### 5.7.4 Conclusions
The Rate adaptation technique is considered as significant improvement to the
HSUPA operation. Three different approaches i.e. 2-loop, 3-loop and modified
2-loop were studied and were shown to have better performance in comparison
with the legacy system i.e. a power based scheduling approach, where the
Serving Grant defines both Tx power level and E-TFCI selection.
Gains in terms of averaged UE throughput observed in evaluation were
significant for higher UE densities and for higher RoT values. With 15 dB RoT
target and for 10 users per cell, gains up to 25% over legacy scheduling were
observed with modified 2-loop approach which does not require any standard
changes. The 2-loop and 3-loop schemes were shown to provide additional gains
from decoupling power control and scheduling. Gains up to 31% for 3-loop and
up to 40% for 2-loop approach respectively, over legacy scheduling were
observed. It should be noted that in evaluated scenarios efficient operation
of the modified 2-loop scheme may provide similar gains as the 2-loop and
3-loop schemes.
Each presented approach of Rate Adaptation provides better RoT management
which has a direct impact on system stability. The 3-loop approach provides
independent control over DPCCH SIR due to introduction of an additional
standardised control loop. However, the 2-loop and modified 2-loop approaches
can also control DPCCH SIR with network side proprietary solutions. No

the DPCCH Ec/No target was derived to be sufficient for high RoT target, and

Simulations for evaluating achievable gains with the Lean carrier concept are
performed on a single carrier, representing the Lean carrier or a baseline
secondary carrier. The simulations are performed modeling one or more UE\'s
transmitting bursty traffic using either the Lean carrier concept or using a
baseline based on DC-HSUPA and CPC.
\- Lean carrier - Transmissions in these simulation assumptions are scheduled
periodically with a predefined transmission length and a predefined
transmission periodicity. For an \"ideal\" Lean Carrier user DPCCH is only
transmitted during data transmission meaning that no preambles/post-ambles or
DPCCH bursts are transmitted.
\- Baseline - Transmissions are scheduled according to the same pattern
(transmission length and transmission periodicity) as the Lean carrier
user(s).
### A.1.1.1 Data traffic pattern
One traffic pattern to study is 10TTI data transmission in every 160TTIs.
Studying other traffic patterns is optional.
### A.1.1.2 Interference modelling on data transmissions
Simulations are performed in such a way that it\'s possible to draw
conclusions on the effect from the number of activated users for different
traffic management strategies (e.g. including different CPC burst patterns).
Simulation results shall be provided for various numbers of users interfering
with data transmissions. E.g. 2, 1, 0.5, 0.33 or 0.25 users. Fractional
interfering users can be interpreted as they interfere only part of the time,
e.g. 0.5 means that users only interfere with the data transmissions 50% of
the time.
When results are presented the assumed number of activated users on the
secondary carrier and the assumed traffic management strategy can be
explained. They configurations can then be mapped to different selected
interfering users, as mentioned above.
Different frequency pairing scenarios for a Lean carrier can be envisioned.
See Figure A.1.1.2-1. In an ideal scenario, when there aren\'t any
restrictions on the pairing of primary and secondary carriers, the number of
UEs that a Lean carrier can support may be very large. Considering the Rel-9
DC-HSUPA restriction, a Lean carrier can only be paired with an adjacent
carrier. Even with the Rel-9 restriction, the number of UEs supported on a
Lean carrier may still be quite substantial since two primary carriers can be
paired with one Lean carrier.
{width="3.811111111111111in" height="2.3541666666666665in"}
NOTE: F1 to F5 are consecutive adjacent carriers.
In the ideal scenario, a clean carrier can be paired with any other carrier to
form a primary-secondary pair.
With the Rel-9 restriction, a clean carrier can only be paired with an
adjacent carrier.
Figure A.1.1.2-1: Frequency pairing scenarios for a clean carrier
Keeping as many users as possible active on a Lean carrier gives the advantage
of providing good latency for the users that have data to send once they need
to send it.
If the Rel-9 restriction on adjacent carriers is lifted, even more users can
be supported on the Lean carrier. In real smartphone heavy networks of today,
in for example urban environments, it would be possible to support more than
50 users per primary carrier. So supporting 100 users on a Lean carrier could
be possible if the primary carriers are capable to serve that many Lean
carrier UEs.
The CPC configuration **used for comparison** is 1 TTI for DPCCH burst, 20TTI
for CPC cycle 1 and 160TTI for CPC cycle 2. The parameters are chosen for
achieving as low DPCCH overhead as possible using current standard. These
settings results in lower DPCCH overhead. It is assumed that for UEs with data
transmission the CPC cycle is 20 TTI and for background UEs which are supposed
to be dominant the CPC cycle is 160 TTI, i.e. totally 2 TTIs (6 slots) of
DPCCH per burst cycle of 160 TTIs are transmitted taking into account the pre
and post-ambles transmitted with the DPCCH burst. The average number of DPCCH
interferers per TTI can be summarized in Table A.1.1.2-1 and Table A.1.1.2-2.
Table A.1.1.2-1: Mapping of number of users on the clean carrier to number of
interfering DPCCH\'s per TTI in Scenario A

carrier where  
the primary carrier is frequency adjacent to the Lean carrier.

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 10/20 | 20/40 | 30/60 | 40/80 | 50/100 | 60/120 | 70/140 | 80/160 | 90/180 | 100/200  
Average Number of DPCCH Interferers per TTI on the Lean carrier TTI in Cycle 1 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20  
Average Number of DPCCH Interferers per TTI on the Lean carrier TTI in Cycle 2 | 0,25 | 0,5 | 0,75 | 1 | 1,25 | 1,5 | 1,75 | 2 | 2,25 | 2,5  
NOTE: Lean carrier is configured as Lean carrier is paired with two primary
carriers where  
each primary carrier is frequency adjacent to the Lean carrier.  
Contributions from Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 are given separately. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
The total amount of DPCCH interference per TTI will be the sum of DPCCH
interference from users using cycle 1 and those using cycle 2, considering the
ratio of users using cycle 1 and users using cycle2.

### A.1.2.1 System performance evaluation metrics
For bursty traffic, the following performance measures are used for
evaluation:
Average burst rate:
  * The burst rate is defined as the ratio between the data burst size in bits and the total time the burst spent in the system.
  * The total time the burst spent in the system is the time difference measured between the instant the data burst arrives and the instant when the transfer of the burst over the air interface is completed.
```{=html}
``` \- The total time the burst spent in the system is equal to the sum of the
transmission time over the air and the queuing delay.
Total system throughput
UE throughput: average, 50%, and 5%
Average and CDF of RoT for UL
The baseline should be TDM operation with CPC. It should be emphasized that
Lean and legacy operations are by nature not compatible. The main purpose of
the hybrid carrier scheme is to reduce under-utilization. The gain from Lean
operations is impacted in hybrid scenarios and is expected not to offer gains
compared to that of a scenarios with 100% penetration of Lean carrier users. A
loss can be expected in legacy UEs performance, e.g. broadcast channels are
still needed, scheduling delay is increased for high-bitrate transmissions and
SI transmission delay may be increased.

### B.1.1.1 Grant detection
The approach used to detect the grant transmission is described below:
\- Decode the E-AGCH irrespectively of its actual presence in the received
signal
\- Without passing the CRC check and irrespectively of E-AGCH decoding success
perform E-AGCH coding and mapping on decoded signal
\- Calculate cross-correlation between the obtained signal and the received
signal.
\- The detection threshold is selected to provide fixed, admissible false
alarm probability of 1%.
\- The missed detection probability is measured as a function of the RX Ec/No
{width="5.336805555555555in" height="4.002083333333333in"}
Figure B.1.1.1-1: E-AGCH BLER and missed detection presented as\ a function of
RX Ec/No in AWGN channel
Figure B.1.1.1-1 depicts the missed detection probability and BLER of E-AGCH
channel as a function of Rx Ec/No for the false alarm probability of 1%.
Assuming that the E-AGCH power is high enough to be decoded by all UEs in the
sector with the BLER of 1%, corresponding to -23dB RX Ec/No, the missed
detection probability will be below 0.1%. In this range of RX Ec/No the missed
detection probability is 10 times lower than the probability of not decoding
E-AGCH correctly. Thus, it can be concluded that presented TDM operation
improvement can work with very high reliability.
### B.1.1.2 Fast Scheduling Grant
Example of performance evaluation of E-AGCH and E-RGCH in the FSG perspective
is shown in Figure B.1.1.2-1. The evaluation assume 2ms E-DCH TTI and only one
radio link, i.e. E-RGCH is assumed to be transmitted from serving cell and
hence corresponding E-RGCH coding is used. 2ms TTI is assumed to be the most
interesting case for TDM scheduling.
Performance requirements in 25.101 [21] for 2ms serving E-RGCH are assuming
quite low operation point and hence required error rate for missed hold is 10%
and missed up/down 5%. However, simulations show that 1% error rate for both
can be obtained by using very low Ec/Ior values and thus low overhead. It must
be noted that when E-RGCH is re-used for FSG signalling typically only one or
two UEs are scheduled at the same time and number of simultaneously
transmitted FSG signatures is low. There is no need to transmit signatures
used to transmit FSG to the UEs that are not scheduled. Assumptions have been
different when HSUPA downlink channel performance requirements have been
specified and hence lower overhead is desirable there.
As can be seen Ec/Ior required to obtain 1% error probability is 4-5 dBs lower
for E-RGCH than E-AGCH. If FSG is signalled separately for each TTI then it
means re-using E-RGCH would be beneficial compared to E-AGCH scheme if
transmission of packet requires in average less than three TTIs. However, if
FSG on/off signalling scheme is used then the E-RGCH solution becomes more
efficient despite the fact that also the FSG off needs to be transmitted.
Aforementioned applies only to separate FSG signalling and does not take
changing power grant into account.

## B.1.2 Link Level Simulations Results for Lean carrier
It was agreed in [17] to simplify the evaluation by performing simulations on
a single carrier that represents the dedicated secondary carrier. Bursty
traffic on the dedicated secondary carrier is modeled using periodic
transmissions from one or more UEs. Comparisons are then made between the Lean
carrier proposal and the baseline CPC solution.
Lean carrier transmissions are scheduled periodically with a predefined
transmission length and a predefined transmission periodicity. Two versions of
the Lean Carrier are considered:
\- Lean0: The basic Lean Carrier where user DPCCH is transmitted only during
data transmission, with no preambles/post-ambles or DPCCH bursts transmitted.
\- Lean+: Lean carrier with preambles and post-ambles immediately before and
after each burst of data transmission.
Baseline CPC transmissions are scheduled according to the same pattern as the
Lean carrier users. DPCCH gating is used to reduce the control channel
overhead. This means DPCCH preambles, post-ambles and periodic DPCCH bursts
are transmitted, creating extra interference on the dedicated secondary
carrier. Baseline CPC users configured on the dedicated secondary carrier can,
therefore, interfere with each other even when they are not transmitting data.
### B.1.2.1 Simulation scenarios and results
This clause contains a comprehensive summary of the different scenarios that
have been evaluated, and presents the main results and observations that were
captured from the simulations. Most of the simulations were performed by using
the PA 3km/h channel model, but results for the TU 3km/h and VA 30km/h channel
models have been included in a complementary way aiming at further extending
this study.
### B.1.2.2 Impact of DPCCH bursts on data transmission
#### B.1.2.2.1 Scenario A: 10Mbps transmissions in a PA3 environment
High bitrate transmission requires operation in a high RoT environment. When
operating close to the pole capacity, the system can easily become unstable.
The interference from the CPC bursts of non-scheduled users, although small in
absolute term, can have a significant impact on the data rate of the
transmitting user. The simulation results for 10 Mbps transmissions have been
presented in [18]. The transmission patterns for the Lean and the CPC cases
are given in Figure B.1.2.2.1-1.
{width="5.467361111111111in" height="1.575in"}
NOTE: All cases have a 10ms data burst and a 40ms repetition cycle.\ For the
CPC case, the data transmissions are interfered by a number of DPCCH bursts.\
For the Lean cases, there is no interferer.

B.1.2.2.1-2

NOTE: From left to right and top to bottom: Results of BLER vs Ec/No for 0, 1,
2, and 4 interfering DPCCH bursts.
Figure B.1.2.2.1-2: Impact of DPCCH bursts on data transmission at 10 Mbps
The results are reproduced here in Figure B.1.2.2.1-2. It can be seen that the
Lean+ case in general performs slightly better than the Lean0 case. This is
due to the extra preambles, which provides more opportunity (especially for
small burst sizes) for power control to adapt to fast fading. Furthermore, the
preambles are not being interfered. Adding interference on the preamble will
narrow the gap between Lean0 and Lean+. When there is no interferer, the CPC
case is by definition identical to the Lean+. When the number of interferers
increases, the CPC performance decreases quite quickly and start to become
unstable when there are more than two interferers. This confirms the basic
premise that the performance of high bitrate transmissions is very susceptible
to interference and it needs to operate in a clean environment.
To summarize, at a high bitrate such as 10 Mbps, data transmissions are rather
sensitive to small interferences and can become unstable when interfered by
more than a couple of DPCCH bursts.
#### B.1.1.2.2 Scenario B: Lower bitrates for the TU3 and VA30 environments
The performance for Lean Carrier and CPC in the case of the TU3 channel model
is shown in Figure B.1.1.2.2-1.
{width="3.3847222222222224in" height="2.5194444444444444in"}
NOTE: Results of BLER vs Ec/No for 1, 2 and 4 interfering DPCCH bursts.
Figure B.1.1.2.2-1: Impact of DPCCH bursts on data transmission at 5 Mbps by
using the TU3 channel model
Compared to the PA channel, the TU channel model is more dispersive (it is
composed by 20 taps, while its maximum delay spread is 2.140Âµs) and it is more
challenging to achieve high date rates. As a consequence 5Mbps is used in the
simulations. Although less severe given that the data rate was reduced, in
general from Figure B.1.1.2.2-1 it can be seen that the trend that was
observed before in Figure B.1.2.2.1-2 for case of 10Mbps also prevails here.
That is, it can be noticed that even when the DPCCH bursts are tiny in terms
of power, they lead to some performance degradation for CPC.
The VA30 channel was also taken into consideration. It is slightly more
dispersive (maximum delay spread = 2.510 Âµs) than the TU channel, and in
addition to that, its higher speed will add more complexity to the scenario
since in this case the channel is changing much more rapidly (shorter
coherence time) compared to the speed of the previously studied channels. The
results are shown in Figure B.1.1.2.2-2.
{width="3.5756944444444443in" height="2.520138888888889in"}
NOTE: Results of BLER vs Ec/No for 1, 2 and 4 interfering DPCCH bursts.
Figure B.1.1.2.2-2: Impact of DPCCH bursts on data transmission at 2 Mbps by
using the VA30 channel model
From the above figure it can be noticed that the trend among Lean Carrier and
CPC is also consistent for the VA30 channel even when the data rate was
deliberately decreased up to 2Mbps aiming at managing in a better way the
dispersivity and fading rapidity given by the nature of this channel.
To summarize, when more dispersive channel models, as it is the case of the TU
and VA are used for evaluating the impact of the DPCCH burst on data
transmission, it can be observed that the CPC performance deteriorates even if
the data rate is reduced aiming at overcoming the adverse effects of this type
of channels. However, it is also observed that the extent of the deterioration
decreases as the transmission rate goes down.
#### B.1.2.2.3 Scenario C: 5Mbps transmission in a PA3 environment
By following the same idea of the scenario shown in Figure B.1.2.2.1-1, the
Lean carrier proposal and CPC were evaluated by considering 10TTIs data
transmission in every 160 TTIs with a DTX cycle of 20TTIs, and a DPCCH burst
size equal to 1 subframe (i.e., an extreme CPC setting).
Two DPCCH ILPC methods, i.e. control target at DPCCH SINR and DPCCH SNR were
considered. The simulation results are depicted in Figure B.1.2.2.3-1 and
Figure B.1.2.2.3-2 assuming DPCCH target equals to -14dB.
{width="4.8125in" height="3.1354166666666665in"}
Figure B.1.2.2.3-1: Simulation Results of 1 and 2 Interferences (DPCCH SINR
target -14dB)
{width="4.8125in" height="3.1354166666666665in"}
Figure B.1.2.2.3-2: Simulation Results of 1 and 2 Interferences (DPCCH SNR
target -14dB)
In case of ILPC target of SINR used (Figure B.1.2.2.3-1), the impact of
interference on DPCCH burst for other users results in about 1dB performance
loss at maximum. In case of ILPC target of SNR used (Figure B.1.2.2.3-2), the
impact of interference on DPCCH burst for other users is reduced to about
0.5dB performance loss at maximum.
The BLER results are provided in Figure B.1.2.2.3-3 and Figure B.1.2.2.3-4
assuming DPCCH target equals to -19dB.
{width="4.8125in" height="3.1354166666666665in"}

target, -19dB)
{width="4.8125in" height="3.1354166666666665in"}
Figure B.1.2.2.3-4: Simulation Results of 1 and 2 Interferences (DPCCH SNR
target -19dB)
It can be observed that the impact of DPCCH burst on data for other users is
reduced to 0.4dB at maximum in case of ILPC target at DPCCH SINR and almost no
impact in case of ILPC target at DPCCH SNR.
In conclusion, at 5Mbps, and for the PA3 channel model it is observed that the
performance gain of Lean carrier is lower in case of DPCCH control target at
SNR than in case of DPCCH SINR. The performance gain of Lean carrier will be
further reduced, if we lower the DPCCH target value from -14dB to -19dB. It
should be noted that there is no performance gain of Lean carrier in case of
DPCCH SNR target equal to -19dB.
### B.1.2.3 Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts
It has been noted in [19] that the large fluctuation in interference in a
\"clean\" environment may make it difficult for the DPCCH bursts used in CPC
to fulfill their role in tracking fast fading and providing the right power
level at the starts of data transmissions. This clause presents simulations
results concerning this issue.
#### B.1.2.3.1 Alternating data and DPCCH bursts
The scenario used in this clause is depicted in Figure B.1.2.3.1-1.
{width="4.353472222222222in" height="1.1465277777777778in"}
NOTE 1: Two users with identical transmission pattern but transmitting 180Â°
out of phase were simulated.\ The pattern consists of alternating data and
DPCCH bursts separated by a gap of length T.\ All cases have a 6ms data
burst.\ The gap T is varied between 10 and 80 ms giving repetition periods of
32 to 172 ms (repetition period = 2(T+6ms)).
NOTE 2: The Lean case (representing both Lean0 and Lean+), the interfering
data burst is shown for illustrative purpose only, it has no effect on the
other user.
Figure B.1.2.3.1-1: Transmission pattern A for studying the impact of
interference on DPCCH bursts
The result of the simulations is shown in Figure B.1.2.3.1-2. These
simulations show the impact on link performance for closely spaced
transmissions (up to 172 ms apart) with one DPCCH burst in between. The
degradation due to the presence of the DPCCH burst is significant in all
cases: a 2 to 4 dB increase in Ec/No at 10% BLER compared to the Lean0 case.
The variation in the amount of degradation between the different cases seems
to be related to correlation of the transmissions with the fast fading cycle.
**Observation:** Intervening DPCCH bursts have a significant impact on the
performance of short and closely spaced data bursts.

Alternating data and DPCCH bursts for 10 Mbps data transmissions (pattern A)
#### B.1.2.3.2 Multiple DPCCH bursts between data transmissions
Another property of smart-phone traffic is the unpredictable nature of when
the next activity burst will come. As a result, there may be none or many
intervening DPCCH bursts between two data transÂ­missions. Figure B.1.2.3.2-1
shows the transmission pattern for the case where there are 3 intervening
DPCCH bursts.
Figure B.1.2.3.2-2 shows the performance impact when one or more of the DPCCH
bursts of one user are interfered by data transmissions from other users. A
clear trend of performance degradation can be seen as more and more of the
DPCCH bursts are interfered with.
**Observation:** The performance degradation due to DPCCH burst being
interfered by data transmissions has a cumulative effect. The more the number
of DPCCH bursts being interfered with the larger is the impact on the
efficiency of the subsequent transmissions.
{width="5.99375in" height="1.520138888888889in"}
NOTE: For each CPC user, a DPCCH burst of 6ms is transmitted every 86 ms and a
6ms data burst is transmitted every 4 DPCCH burst (344 ms).\ One, two, or all
three of the standalone DPCCH bursts may be interfered by data transmissions.\
The simulated CPC scenarios are: 0+1, 0+1+2, and 0+1+2+3.\ Users 1, 2, and 3
for the Lean case are included for illustrative purpose only.\ They do not
interfere with user 0 or with each other.

interference on DPCCH bursts

NOTE: The different curves show the case where 1, 2, and 3 of the 3 DPCCH
bursts are interfered by data transmissions and the comparison with the Lean
carrier cases.
Figure B.1.2.3.2-2: Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts case 2:\
Alternating 1 data and 3 DPCCH bursts for 5 Mbps data transmissions.
In order to know the implications of dealing with some other channel models
for this type of scenarios, the TU3 and VA30 channels were studied as well.
So, by following the same idea, the scenario depicted in Figure B.1.2.3.2-1,
was firstly evaluated for the TU3 channel model, which results are shown in
Figure B.1.2.3.2-3.
{width="4.038888888888889in" height="3.03125in"}
Figure B.1.2.3.2-3: Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts case 2 for the TU3
channel model: Alternating 1 data and 3 DPCCH bursts for 5Mbps data
transmissions.
By performing an inspection of the curve shown above, it can be noticed that
the performance of a CPC user is degraded by the interference undergone by the
DPCCH bursts. Moreover, cumulative effect takes place as more DPCCH bursts get
hit by data of other users.
Continuing with the analysis, the same scenario was evaluated for the VA30
channel, with its results shown in Figure B.1.2.3.2-4.
{width="4.274305555555555in" height="3.0319444444444446in"}
Figure B.1.2.3.2-4: Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts case 2 for the VA30
channel model: Alternating 1 data and 3 DPCCH bursts for 2Mbps data
transmissions.
When the same scenario is evaluated under the VA30 channel conditions, in
general the performance for Lean Carrier and CPC with 1/3 of the DPCCH bursts
hit by data at the10% BLER operating point is quite similar (To remember that
VA30 was evaluated at 2Mbps aiming at being consistent with what is described
at the end of the subclause B.1.2.4.1; where it is stated that the data rate
was decreased aiming at overcoming the adverse effects of this channel),
however a bias in the performance starts to become distinguishable when 2/3
and 3/3 of the DPCCH bursts are hit by data.
In conclusion, the cumulative effect observed for the PA3 channel also
prevails for the TU3 and VA30 channels. The performance of CPC gradually gets
biased as more DPCCH bursts are hit by data, highlighting that although it was
less evident for VA30 since it was evaluated at 2Mbps, the cumulative effect
also occurred.
### B.1.2.4 Extreme CPC settings
One proposal to reduce the impact from the DPCCH bursts is to reduce the
average DPCCH load due to unscheduled users. The DPCCH load can be reduced by
reducing the burst size and increasing the DTX cycle. This clause looks at the
performance of some scenarios with extreme CPC settings, in particular, those
with the longest DTX cycle (320 ms) and the smallest DPCCH burst (1 subframe +
preambles and post-ambles) currently allowed by 3GPP.
#### B.1.2.4.1 Alternating data and DPCCH bursts with 20ms data bursts
The transmission pattern for this case is shown in Figure B.1.2.4.1-1. It has
the extreme CPC setting mentioned above and a 20ms data burst.
{width="5.427083333333333in" height="1.073611111111111in"}
NOTE: The Lean case (representing both Lean0 and Lean+) are also shown for
comparison.
Figure B.1.2.4.1-1: Transmission pattern for extreme CPC setting with\
alternating 20ms data and 2ms DPCCH bursts.
The simulation result is shown in Figure B.1.2.4.1-2 below. The performance of
CPC and the Lean cases are rather close. This result is not entirely
unexpected.
Normally, the use of a very small DPCCH burst and a very long DTX gap could
easily lead to power control instability due to the inability to track fast
fading. When factoring in a typical 2â€’3 slot TPC delay, the problem becomes
even worse. In the current scenario, however, the large 30-slot data burst is
able to correct any power control error. Had it not been the alternating
arrangement of the data and DPCCH bursts, the power control error would have
accumulated over time and led to instability. We will see some indication of
this in the results that follow.
Note also that a 20ms burst at 5 Mbps will deliver 12.5 kB of data. This is a
rather large packet compared to many examples of delay-sensitive traffic such
as HTTP request and SIP signaling.
In conclusion, for the specific scenario of an extreme CPC setting with a
constant supply of 10-TTI data bursts every other DPCCH burst, the performance
of CPC and the Lean carrier case are quite similar.
{width="3.5in" height="2.625in"}
Figure B.1.2.4.1-2: Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts for extreme CPC
setting,\ case 1: Alternating data and DPCCH bursts at 5Mbps transmissions.
The transmission pattern for the extreme CPC setting was also evaluated for
the TU3 and VA30 channel models as it is shown in Figure B.1.2.4.1-3 and
Figure B.1.2.4.1-4 respectively
{width="3.188888888888889in" height="2.3625in"}

setting under\ the TU3 channel model: Alternating data and DPCCH bursts at

Figure B.1.2.4.1-4: Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts for extreme CPC
setting under\ the VA30 channel model: Alternating data and DPCCH bursts at
5Mbps transmissions.
In conclusion, when there is a multipath diversity gain given by more
dispersive channels than the PA3 channel model, it is observable that the
specific scenario of considering an extreme CPC setting gets degraded for a
CPC user around 0.5dB compared to Lean carrier when the TU3 channel is in use,
and that when the VA30 channel model enters into consideration then the Lean
carrier case and CPC perform quite similar. However, as it was highlighted in
[17], the fact of having a 10-TTI data burst doesn\'t fit the behaviour of a
smart phone traffic which is characterized by having only a couple of data
bursts every time a user transmits, and which according to [17] deteriorates
the performance of the so called extreme CPC setting.
#### B.1.2.4.2 Multiple DPCCH bursts between 20ms data bursts
To further study the case with extreme CPC setting, the previous scenario is
extended with 3 standalone DPCCH bursts between transmissions. Details of the
transmission patterns are given in Figure B.1.2.4.2-1. The resulting
performance is shown in Figure B.1.2.4.2-2.
{width="5.10625in" height="1.613888888888889in"}
NOTE: One, two, or all three of the DPCCH bursts may be interfered by data
transmissions, i.e., the simulated scenarios are: 0+1, 0+1+2, and 0+1+2+3.\
The Lean case (representing both Lean0 and Lean+) are also shown for
comparison.
Figure B.1.2.4.2-1. Transmission pattern for extreme CPC setting with\ three
2ms DPCCH bursts between two data transmissions
Similar to the less extreme case shown in clause B.1.2.4.1, the performance of
CPC can be seen to deteriorate when more and more of the DPCCH bursts are
interfered with. The performance when only one out of 3 of the DPCCH bursts
are hit is close to those of the Lean carrier cases, but when two or more of
the bursts are hit, the performance is significantly worse.
In conclusion, despite the use of the smallest DPCCH burst of 2ms and a rather
long data burst of 20ms, the trend that the performance deteriorates when more
and more of the DPCCH bursts are interfered by data transmissions remains.
{width="3.6375in" height="3.03125in"}
NOTE: The different CPC curves show the case when 1, 2, and 3 of the 3 DPCCH
bursts are interfered by data transmissions.\ Comparison with the Lean carrier
cases is also shown.
Figure B.1.2.4.2-2. Impact of interference on DPCCH bursts for the extreme CPC
setting,\ case 2: Alternating 1 data and 3 DPCCH burst at 5 Mbps
transmissions.
##### B.1.2.4.3 Different data-burst lengths
The length of the data burst is varied in order to understand the impact it
has on the overall performance, data-burst lengths of 6, 10, and 20 ms have
been investigated. The transmission pattern is identical to the one given in
Figure B.1.2.4.2-1, where all 3 DPCCH are hit by interference, except for the
length of the data bursts which take on the above values for both the CPC and
Lean carrier cases. The resulting performance is given in Figure B.1.2.4.3-1.
As the length of the data burst decreases, the performance with extreme CPC
setting can be seen to deteriorate much more quickly than that of the Lean
carrier cases. The CPC case with a 6ms (3 TTI) data bursts seems to be close
to becoming unstable.
In conclusions, the extreme CPC setting has quite poor performance for data
bursts shorter than 20 ms when compared to the Lean carrier cases. This shows
that the extreme CPC setting will have trouble supporting smaller data bursts
typical of delay-sensitive traffic such as HTTP requests or SIP signaling.

## B.1.3 System level simulation results for Lean carrier
### B.1.3.1 Full-buffer users with a fixed transmission pattern
The results described in this clause use a network of 9 cells. Full-buffer
users are used and each user has a periodic data transmission pattern with 4
TTI of data followed by a gap of 80 TTI. The transmission start for each user
is offset from the previous by 4 TTI so that there is no gap between the
transmissions and at most one user transmitting at any one time.
Retransmissions are given absolute priority over new data transmissions. This
means a retransmission would always steal the transmission slot for the users
that follow.
This arrangement allows a maximum of 21 users to transmit in a cell. When
there are more than 21 users in a cell, irrespective of whether that is due to
a higher amount of offered traffic or normal traffic fluctuations, the extra
users are not scheduled. As with link system simulations, three scenarios,
Lean0, Lean+, and CPC, are distinguished. In the CPC case, a DPCCH burst of 2
TTI is transmitted in the gap between two data transmissions. This is
illustrated in Figure B.1.3.1-1 below.
Outer-loop power control is used to control the HARQ BLER at a 10% level for
both Lean carrier and CPC users. Simulations are performed for both the Ped A
3 km/h and TU 3 km/h channel models. The results are given in separate clauses
below.
{width="6.497222222222222in" height="2.138888888888889in"}
Figure B.1.3.1-1: Transmission pattern used by full-buffer users

#### B.1.3.1.1 TU3 simulation results
Simulations were performed for the Lean0 and CPC case with the TU3 channel.
The results are shown in Figure B.1.3.1.1-1.
{width="6.480555555555555in" height="4.0in"}
Figure B.1.3.1.1-1: Simulation results for fixed transmission pattern with the
TU3 channel
The average cell throughputs between the Lean and CPC cases are very similar.
This is expected since there is the same amount of offered traffic in each
case and the HARQ BLER is control at 10% for all users. The difference between
the two cases is in the average interference in the cells. Starting at 10
user/cell, the Lean0 case can be seen to have roughly a 2dB lower RoT than the
CPC case at the 50 percentile.
#### B.1.3.1.2 PA3 simulation results
For the PA3 channel, an extra case with Lean+ was added. The results are shown
in Figure B.1.3.1.2-1. As before, the uplink cell throughputs for the three
cases are very similar. A similar trend for the average RoT as in the TU3 case
is observed a gain of 1 to 2 dB for the Lean cases over the CPC case.

Figure B.1.2.1.3-1: Simulation results for fixed transmission pattern with the
PA3 channel
#### B.1.3.1.3 Summary for the fixed transmission pattern scenario
Average cell throughput and average RoT has been studied for the 3 scenarios
of Lean0, Lean+ and CPC using a fixed transmission pattern and different
numbers of full-buffer users per cell. Due to the fixed offered load in each
scenario and the same HARQ BLER target, very similar cell throughputs are seen
in all case. The main difference lies in the average RoT, with the Lean0 and
Lean+ cases having a gain of 1 to 2 dB over the CPC case in medium to high
load scenarios.
### B.1.3.2 Dynamic traffic with round-robin scheduling
This clause describes simulation results performed using dynamic traffic and a
round robin scheduling. The traffic is given by a truncated lognormal
distribution for file sizes (125 Â± 45 kB) and an exponential distribution for
reading times (5s average), as they are specified in the system simulation
assumption clause above.
For the round-robin scheduling, each user is given transmission priority for a
fixed number of TTIs. If the user runs out of data to send or if the number of
prioritized TTIs is reached, the transmission priority goes immediately to the
next user. As in the fixed pattern case, retransmissions have absolute
priority over new transmissions and a user can lose some of their transmission
slots due to retransmissions from previously transmitted users.
Simulations are performed with the PA3 channel for the Lean+ case and two CPC
cases with different settings:
(DPCCH burst size) / (DTX cycle length) = 4ms / 160ms and 2ms / 320ms,
where the same cycle length is used for both cycle 1 and cycle 2, and the
preambles and post-amble are not included in the burst sizes. The results are
given in Figure B.1.3.2-1.
{width="3.3333333333333335in"
height="2.9166666666666665in"}{width="3.3333333333333335in"
height="2.9166666666666665in"}
Figure B.1.3.2-1: Comparison of average RoT (left) and average cell throughput
(right) between Lean and two CPC cases with different burst sizes (4ms, 2ms)
and DTX cycle lengths (160ms, 320ms).
These results show that with dynamic traffic, the difference in average RoT
between Lean carrier and the CPC cases are more pronounced than with a fixed
transmission pattern. At a full load of 100 user/cell, a 4dB lower RoT can be
achieved even when compared to the most extreme CPC case with the shortest
possible burst size and the longest possible cycle length. Improvement in
average cell throughput is also seen.
In the case of CPC, the variations observed in the cell throughput and RoT are
connected to the fact that an increased amount of DPCCH bursts in the system
leads to power control inaccuracies due to collisions of DPCCH bursts with
data and vice versa. This in turn results in more HARQ retransmissions for the
CPC case in comparison to the Lean carrier proposal. The simulation was
conducted without RoT control, and the active user was always scheduled with 5
Mbps instantaneous data rate. Considering the traffic model used, the system
reaches 100% TTI utilization at around 25 users with user data rates close to
160 kbps on average, and with 100 users the UE throughout is 40 kbps on
average.

# B.3 Rate adaptation
## B.3.1 Link simulation results for Rate adaptation
### B.3.1.1 Simulation set 1
#### B.3.1.1.1 Additional assumptions
The results are simulated for realistic channel estimation, power control
measurements, finger placement and E-DPCCH decoding in order to more fairly
account for the DPCCH reception reliability impact on the system performance
as well as the DPCCH overhead.
Additional simulations have been completed to optimize the DPCCH settings for
each of the scheduling schemes. The parameters being optimized and the results
obtained for each of the schemes are as follows:
1 For the power-based scheduling and the modified 2-loop approach, the
parameter being optimized is the target pre-receiver DPCCH SIR used for the
E-DPDCH gain factors design. According to the simulations the value of -16 dB
is taken.
2 For the 2-loop scheme, the DPCCH pre-receiver RX Ec/No is optimized and the
selected value is -12 dB.
3 For the 3-loop scheme, the DPCCH target post-receiver SIR controlled by the
third loop is the optimization parameter. The value of 10 dB is taken.
It should be noted that DPCCH level over thermal noise is constant in the
2-loop approach and was optimized for Rx Ec/No target equals to 20dB.
Motivation behind that was to achieve reliable DPCCH reception in all
scenarios.

It can be seen that according to the presented link-level simulation results
the modified 2-loop approach provides equivalent and even slightly better
performance than other evaluated schemes except for the Veh A, 30 km/h channel
where the 2-loop scheme demonstrates a small gain over the modified 2-loop
approach. The gains of the SINR-based scheduling options relative to the
power-based scheduling are up to 10-13%.

km/h (b), and Veh A 30 km/h (c) channel models
As we can see from the provided link-level results, the RX Ec/No distributions
of the 2-loop and 3-loop approaches of the SINR-based scheduling algorithm
demonstrate much more accurate RoT control than for the power-based scheme.
The modified 2-loop performance in terms of the RoT control accuracy is in
between the 2/3-loop SINR-based scheduling and the power-based scheduling.
That behavior is considered to be the expected one since the approaches using
more direct procedures for the RX power level control provides more stable RoT
distributions.
It should be also noted that while a lower RX power stability of the modified
2-loop approach relative to the 2-loop and 3-loop schemes does not impact
negatively the performance at the link level, at the system level it may be a
reason for an additional system performance loss in for the case of multiple
UEs per sector. A possible mechanism for this loss is a stronger variation of
the interference level in the system.

scheduling for the Veh A 30 km/h channel models
The modified 2-loop approach provides very close DPCCH SINRs to the power-
based scheme due to the same E-DPDCH beta-factor set used in the simulations.
According to the presented results, it can be seen that despite different
principles involved in the DPCCH SINR and power level control, all the
scheduling algorithms provide similar distributions of the DPCCH SINR. The
average DPCCH SINR level is approximately equal to 10 dB that is sufficient to
guarantee reliable Node B synchronization, power estimation and E-DPCCH
decoding procedures.
As can be observed from the figures above DPCCH SIR level in case of 2-loop
scheme and low Rx Ec/No is higher compared to other schemes. It is caused by
the fact that in case of this scheme we do not assume a dynamic control over
DPCCH power. That is why constant DPCCH level over thermal noise has been
selected via additional Link Level simulations. This level has been optimized
for 20dB Rx Ec/No in order to ensure reliable DPCCH reception regardless of
the scenario. That is why the DPCCH level for low Rx Ec/No values is too high
and decreases with increasing Rx Ec/No (thus increasing gain factor). This
DPCCH power overhead visible in case of 2-loop scheme and low Rx Ec/No can be
optimized by the propriety solutions but it was not the part of this
evaluation. It can be observed that the 3-loop scheme provides stable control
of the DPCCH SIR at the given SIR target of 10dB in all simulations which
gives a built in protection of DPCCH and control channel performance. Thus the
benefit of the third loop is specifying a method for maintaining the DPCCH Rx
power at the desired level regardless of varying levels of interference, while
other rate adaptation schemes require proprietary solutions for ensuring an
adequate DPCCH Rx power level.

Figure B.3.1.2.3-3: DPCCH SIR CDF, VA30 channel model
Without the SIR control loop, the 2-loop and modified 2-loop scheme do not
control SIR and it can be observed that the SIR range with 2-loop and modified
2-loop schemes varies in different channel models. In the 3-loop scheme, when
the SIR target control is based on the BER of the control channel, the
demodulation error of control channel will result in the rising of SIR. So in
some cases a large SIR is observed for the 3-loop scheme.
## B.3.2 System simulation results for Rate adaptation
### B.3.2.1 Simulation set 1
#### B.3.2.1.1 Additional assumptions
All system level simulations for the baseline (power-based) scheduling and the
2-loop, modified 2-loop and 3-loop schemes are performed in assumption of the
TDM scheduling. In particular, only a single UE in each sector in the same TTI
is selected for the data transmission and transmits the DPCCH, E-DPCCH and
E-DPDCH channels. All other UEs transmit only the DPCCH channel every TTI. A
UE scheduled for the data transmission is randomly re-selected among all
associated UEs once per the scheduling period of 10 TTIs. I.e., all associated
UEs occupy equal time-domain and RX power resources on average. The UE re-
selections are performed in different sectors asynchronously.\ The OLPC or
marginal loops are frozen while a UE is not scheduled.
A short summary of the power control and scheduling operations for different
schemes is presented in Table B.3.2.1.1-1.

For the 2-loop and modified 2-loop schemes, scheduled UEs in the TDM mode have
the same (equal) RX power targets. The equal targets are also used for the RX
power of non-scheduled UEs (for DPPCH reception). For the 3-loop scheduling
scheme, for non-scheduled UEs only one ILPC loop driven by the DPCCH SINR is
active (similar to the legacy scheduling scheme) to adjust the DPCCH power
level.
The DPCCH power setting for all scheduling schemes is performed to provide (on
average) a required DPCCH post-receiver SINR level of \~10 dB when 20 dB RoT
target is used. The SLS parameters impacting the DPCCH power setting are the
DPCCH SIR used for E-DPDCH gain factors design for the baseline and modified
2-loop schemes, the DPCCH Ec/No for the 2-loop scheme and the target DPCCH
SINR for the 3-loop scheme. The selected values for the mentioned parameters
are listed in Clause A.3.2.

The provided simulation results demonstrate that the 2-loop and 3-loop
approaches have very close performance with a marginal benefit of the 2-loop
scheme. Both schemes provide the significant gain over the legacy power-based
scheduling (baseline) of about 20-40% in terms of the average UE throughput.
The gains are higher for higher UE densities and for higher target RoT values.
The modified 2-loop approach performs similarly to the 2-loop approach (Figure
B.3.2.1.2-4) for low UE densities (0.25 UEs per sector and below) which is
additionally confirmed by the link level simulation results (Clause B.3.1).
However, for higher UE densities (1-10 UEs per sector) the performance of the
modified 2-loop scheme is situated between the performance for the power-based
scheduling and the 2-loop scheme. The gains of the modified 2-loop approach
over the baseline are up to 10-25% which is lower than for other proposed rate
adaptation schemes. The gains of the 2-loop approach over the modified 2-loop
approach for high UE densities (1-10 UEs per sector) reach 8% for the RoT of 6
dB and 16% for the RoT of 15 dB.
The main reason for a lower performance of the modified 2-loop approach in
comparison with the 2-loop and 3-loop schemes consists in non-complete
decoupling of the power-control and rate adaptation procedures. The remaining
interaction of those two mechanisms is in a variation of the E-DPDCH beta-
factors together with variations of the data rate (E-TFC) according to the
legacy UE procedure. This leads to stronger variations ofTX and RX powers in
the system (lower stability) as well as to the necessity of readjustment of
the power via ILPC after each E-TFC change which limits the power control and
rate adaptation accuracy.
The described behavior of the results is also identical for the Veh A, 3 and
Veh A, 30 km/h channel models.

The provided RoT distributions demonstrate that all the proposed schemes of
improved rate adaptation have steeper CDFs (higher level of RoT stability) in
comparison with the power-based scheduling (baseline). The 2-loop approach has
the most straight and robust mechanism of the RoT control that is confirmed by
the most accurate performance observed from the presented graphs. The curves
for the modified 2-loop approach and the 3-loop approach are less steep
because of additional procedures involved into the power control when compared
to the 2-loop approach. For the modified 2-loop approach a stronger power
spread (relative to the 3-loop) is caused by additional TX power variations
occurring at E-TFC change. For the 3-loop approach, stronger power variations
are caused by interaction of two ILPC loops. It was also observed that for
high UE densities slightly higher RoT was observed for the 2-loop solution
than other rate adaptation schemes. The higher RoT overshoot of the modified
2-loop compared to 2-loop may be explained by the rate adaptation frequency of
1 TTI; every time the OLPC sees BLER target deviate from the target a new
grant is issued leading to a transient in experienced RoT, until ILPC
converges back to the RoT target. If the modified 2-loop is operated
differently is may be possible that the overshoot is mitigated.

A proper selection of the DPCCH RX Ec/No should be done for the 2-loop and
modified 2-loop schemes to reach the required level of DPCCH SINR, while for
other approaches (3-loop and power-based) that DPCCH SINR is controlled
directly. However, the DPCCH SINR distributions demonstrate that the required
SINR minimum average level of 10 dB is in most cases achieved on for all
evaluated scheduling schemes. For higher UE densities (e.g. 10 users per
sector) the 3-loop scheme is observed to provide a more stable control of the
DPCCH SIR compared to other schemes.

The provided RoT distributions also demonstrate that both 2-loop and modified
2-loop schemes have gain to the baseline. All CDFs show that SINR-based
scheduling have steeper curve than legacy scheduling since SINR-based
scheduling has better controlling of ROT.
### B.3.2.4 Soft handover simulation results for 2-loop Rate adaptation
The following six SHO options have been considered and simulated for the
2-loop rate adaptation:
1a. (baseline option). SHO is disabled, TPC commands are sent only from the
serving Node B and the rate adaptation procedure is performed at the serving
Node B;
1b. SHO is disabled, TPC commands are sent from all Nodes B in the active set
(TPC commands from non-serving Nodes B operating like overload indicators),
and the rate adaptation procedure is performed at the serving Node B only;
2a. SHO is enabled, TPC commands are sent only from the serving Node B, the
rate adaptation procedure is performed at the serving Node B only;
2b. SHO is enabled, TPC commands are sent from all Nodes B in the active set
(TPC commands from non-serving Nodes B operating like overload indicators),
the rate adaptation procedure is performed at the serving Node B only;
3a. SHO is enabled, TPC commands are sent only from the serving Node B, the
rate adaptation procedure is performed in a collaborative way by Nodes B from
the active set at the RNC;
3b. SHO is enabled, TPC commands are sent from all Nodes B in the active set
(TPC commands from non-serving Nodes B operating like overload indicators),
the rate adaptation procedure is performed in a collaborative way by Nodes B
from the active set at the RNC.
The lists of system level simulation assumptions for the deployment model and
assumptions of the system operation are provided in simulation assumptions,
and additional parameters are provided in Table B.3.2.4-1.

The presented results demonstrate that the SHO gains with novel rate
adaptation differ depending on UE densities and RoT target. Enabling SHO for
novel rate adaptation can bring up to 9% average UE throughput gain depending
on the channel model used. The final choice of SHO approach should also
consider aspects other than throughput gains i.e. complexity, signalling
overhead etc.
