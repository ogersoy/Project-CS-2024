# 3 Definitions, Symbols and Abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Elementary Procedure:** RNSAP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures
(Eps). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between two RNCs. An
EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two
kinds of Eps are used:
**\- Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure);
**\- Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 Eps, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure has
been successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
Class 2 Eps are considered always successful.
**Prepared Reconfiguration:** A Prepared Reconfiguration exists when the
Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure has been
completed successfully. The Prepared Reconfiguration does not exist anymore
only after either of the procedures Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration
Commit or Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Cancellation has been
completed. In particular, the Prepared Reconfiguration still exists if the
object (e.g. Radio Link) concerned by the Synchronised Radio Link
Reconfiguration (e.g. in the case of an HS-DSCH Setup) is removed, but the UE
Context still exists.
**UE Context:** The UE Context contains the necessary information for the
DRNC/DBSS to communicate with a specific UE. The UE Context is created by the
Radio Link Setup procedure or by the Uplink Signalling Transfer procedure when
the UE makes its first access in a cell controlled by the DRNS/DBSS or by
Enhanced Relocation procedure when the procedure is the first dedicated RNSAP
procedure for the UE. The UE Context is deleted by the Radio Link Deletion
procedure, by the Common Transport Channel Resources Release procedure, or by
the Downlink Signalling Transfer procedure when neither any Radio Links nor
any common transport channels are established towards the concerned UE. The UE
Context is identified by the SCCP Connection for messages using connection
oriented mode of the signalling bearer and the D-RNTI for messages using
connectionless mode of the signalling bearer, unless specified otherwise in
the procedure text.
**Distant RNC Context:** The Distant RNC context is created by the first
Common Measurement Initiation Procedure or Information Exchange Initiation
Procedure initiated by one RNC/BSS and requested from another RNC/BSS. The
Distant RNC Context is deleted after the Common Measurement Termination, the
Common Measurement Failure, the Information Exchange Termination or the
Information Exchange Failure procedure when there is no more Common
Measurement and no more Information to be provided by the requested RNC/BSS to
the requesting RNC/BSS. The Distant RNC Context is identified by a connection
oriented signalling bearer (See TS 25.422 [68]) as, for common measurements
and information exchange, only the connection oriented mode of the signalling
bearer is used.
**Signalling radio bearer 2:** The signalling radio bearer 2 is used by the UE
to access a GERAN cell in order to perform RRC procedures.
**UE Link:** see definition in TS 25.346 [50].
**URA Link:** see definition in TS 25.346 [50].
**MBMS Bearer Service:** see defintion in TS 23.246 [51].
**MBMS session:** see defintion in TS 25.346 [50].
**MBMS session start:** see defintion in TS 25.346 [50].
**MBMS session stop:** see defintion in TS 25.346 [50].
**MBMS Selected Services** : see defintion in TS 25.346 [50].
**PUESBINE feature:** as defined in TS 23.195 [65].

# 4 General
## 4.1 Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the DRNC/CRNC exactly and completely. The SRNC functional
behaviour is left unspecified. The Physical Channel Reconfiguration procedure,
[TDD -- the UE Measurement Inititation, the UE Measurement Reporting, UE
Measurement Termination, UE Measurement Failure,] and the Reset procedure are
an exception from this principle.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in subclause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
1) Functionality which "shall" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain
function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure
X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a
Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report
unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause
value.
  1. Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported,"
perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node
shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting
node about the not supported functionality.
Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly
indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly
indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the
optional IE shall not be included. For requirements for including _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE, see section 10. For examples on how to use the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE, see Annex C.
## 4.2 Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a
mechanism in which all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard
format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be
decoded regardless of the standard version.
## 4.3 Source Signalling Address Handling
The sender of an RNSAP messages shall include the Source Signalling Address,
i.e. the Signalling Address of the sending node.
## 4.4 Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

# 5 RNSAP Services
## 5.1 RNSAP Procedure Modules
The Iur interface RNSAP procedures are divided into five modules as follows:
1\. RNSAP Basic Mobility Procedures;
2\. RNSAP Dedicated Procedures;
3\. RNSAP Common Transport Channel Procedures;
4\. RNSAP Global Procedures;
5\. RNSAP MBMS Procedures.
The Basic Mobility Procedures module contains procedures used to handle the
mobility within UTRAN, within GERAN and between UTRAN and GERAN.
The Dedicated Procedures module contains procedures that are used to handle
DCHs, [FDD -- F-DPCH,] [TDD -- DSCHs, USCHs], HS-DSCH and E-DCH between two
RNSs. If procedures from this module are not used in a specific Iur, then the
usage of DCH, [FDD -- F-DPCH,] [TDD -- DSCH, USCH,] HS-DSCH and E-DCH traffic
between corresponding RNSs is not possible.
The Common Transport Channel Procedures module contains procedures that are
used to control common transport channel data streams (excluding the DSCH, HS-
DSCH and USCH) over Iur interface.
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to a
specific UE. The procedures in this module are in contrast to the above
modules involving two peer CRNCs/CBSSs.
The MBMS Procedures module contains procedures that are specific to MBMS and
used for cases that cannot be handled by other modules.
## 5.2 Parallel Transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in
time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing RNSAP Dedicated
procedure related to a certain UE.
# 6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling transport shall provide two different service modes for the
RNSAP.
1\. Connection oriented data transfer service. This service is supported by a
signalling connection between two RNCs. It shall be possible to dynamically
establish and release signalling connections based on the need. Each active UE
shall have its own signalling connection. The signalling connection shall
provide in sequence delivery of RNSAP messages. RNSAP shall be notified if the
signalling connection breaks.
2\. Connectionless data transfer service. RNSAP shall be notified in case a
RNSAP message did not reach the intended peer RNSAP entity.
# 7 Functions of RNSAP
The RNSAP protocol provides the following functions:
\- Radio Link Management. This function allows the SRNC to manage radio links
using dedicated resources in a DRNS;
\- Physical Channel Reconfiguration. This function allows the DRNC to
reallocate the physical channel resources for a Radio Link;
\- Radio Link Supervision. This function allows the DRNC to report failures
and restorations of a Radio Link;
\- Compressed Mode Control [FDD]. This function allows the SRNC to control the
usage of compressed mode within a DRNS;
\- Measurements on Dedicated Resources. This function allows the SRNC to
initiate measurements on dedicated resources in the DRNS. The function also
allows the DRNC to report the result of the measurements;
\- DL Power Drifting Correction [FDD]. This function allows the SRNC to adjust
the DL power level of one or more Radio Links in order to avoid DL power
drifting between the Radio Links;
\- DCH Rate Control. This function allows the DRNC to limit the rate of each
DCH configured for the Radio Link(s) of a UE in order to avoid congestion
situations in a cell;
\- CCCH Signalling Transfer. This function allows the SRNC and DRNC to pass
information between the UE and the SRNC on a CCCH controlled by the DRNS;
\- GERAN Signalling Transfer. This function allows the SBSS and DBSS, the SRNC
and DBSS or the SBSS and DRNC to pass information between the UE/MS and the
SRNC/SBSS on an SRB2/CCCH controlled by the DBSS/DRNC;
\- Paging. This function allows the SRNC/SBSS to page a UE in a URA/GRA or a
cell in the DRNS;
\- Common Transport Channel Resources Management. This function allows the
SRNC to utilise Common Transport Channel Resources within the DRNS;
\- Relocation Execution. This function allows the SRNC/SBSS to finalise a
Relocation previously prepared via other interfaces;
\- Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting of
general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not
been defined;
\- DL Power Timeslot Correction [TDD]. This function enables the DRNS to apply
an individual offset to the transmission power in each timeslot according to
the downlink interference level at the UE;
\- Measurements on Common Resources. This function allows an RNC/BSS to
request from another RNC/BSS to initiate measurements on Common Resources. The
function also allows the requested RNC/BSS to report the result of the
measurements;
\- Information Exchange. This function allows an RNC to request from another

## 8.2 Basic Mobility Procedures
### 8.2.1 Uplink Signalling Transfer
#### 8.2.1.1 General
The procedure is used by the DRNC to forward a Uu message received on the CCCH
to the SRNC.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of the signalling bearer.
#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 1: Uplink Signalling Transfer procedure, Successful Operation
When the DRNC receives an Uu message on the CCCH in which the UE addressing
information is U-RNTI, i.e. S-RNTI and SRNC-ID, DRNC shall send the UPLINK
SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message to the SRNC identified by the SRNC-ID
received from the UE.
If at least one URA Identity is being broadcast in the cell where the Uu
message was received (the accessed cell), the DRNC shall include a URA
Identity for this cell in the _URA ID_ IE, the _Multiple URAs Indicator_ IE
indicating whether or not multiple URA Identities are being broadcast in the
accessed cell, and the RNC Identity of all other RNCs that are having at least
one cell within the URA where the Uu message was received in the _URA
Information_ IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message.
The DRNC shall include in the message the C-RNTI that it allocates to identify
the UE in the radio interface in the accessed cell. If there is no valid
C-RNTI for the UE in the accessed cell, the DRNS shall allocate a new C-RNTI
for the UE [FDD -- and in case Enhanced FACH operation is activated in the
accessed cell the DRNC shall allocate the HS-DSCH-RNTI to the UE and shall
include the _HS-DSCH-RNTI_ IE in the message. And in case Common E-DCH
operation is activated in the accessed cell the DRNC shall include the E-RNTI
received from Node B and shall include the _E-RNTI_ IE in the message].
[1.28Mcps TDD -- and in case Enhanced FACH operation is activated in the
accessed cell the DRNC shall allocate the HS-DSCH-RNTI to the UE and shall
include the _HS-DSCH-RNTI_ IE in the message and the DRNC shall include the
E-RNTI received from Node B and shall include the _E-RNTI_ IE in the message].
If the DRNS allocates a new C-RNTI it shall also release any C-RNTI previously
allocated for the UE.
If the DRNS has any RACH and/or FACH resources allocated for the UE identified
by the U-RNTI in another cell than the accessed cell in which the Mac SDU
sizes, flow control settings (including credits) and/or transport bearer are
different from those in the old cell, then the DRNS shall not include the
_Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation Not Required_ IE in the
UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message. In addition the DRNS shall
release these RACH and/or FACH resources in old cell.
If the DRNS has any RACH and/or FACH resources allocated for the UE identified
by the U-RNTI in another cell than the accessed cell in which the Mac SDU
sizes, flow control settings (including credits) and transport bearer are the
same as in the old cell, there is no need for Common Transport Channel
Resources Initialisation to be initiated. In that case, DRNC may include the
_Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation Not Required_ IE in the
UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message. In addition, the DRNS shall
move these RACH and/or FACH resources to the new cell. If no Common Transfer
Channel Resources Initialisation procedure is executed, the currently
applicable Mac SDU sizes, flow control settings (including credits) and
transport bearer shall continue to be used while the UE is in the new cell.
If no context exists for this UE in the DRNC, the DRNC shall create a UE
Context for this UE, allocate a D-RNTI for the UE Context, and include the _D-
RNTI_ IE and the identifiers for the CN CS Domain and CN PS Domain that the
DRNC is connected to in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message.
These CN Domain Identifiers shall be based on the LAC and RAC respectively of
the cell where the message was received from the UE.
Depending on local configuration in the DRNS, it may include the geographical
co-ordinates of the cell, represented either by the _Cell GAI_ IE or by the
_Cell GA Additional Shapes_ IE, in which the Uu message was received in the
UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message. If the DRNC includes the _Cell
GA Additional Shapes_ IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message,
it shall also include the _Cell GAI_ IE.
[FDD -- The DRNC shall include the _DPC Mode Change Support Indicator_ IE in
the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if the accessed cell
supports DPC mode change.]
The DRNC shall include [FDD -- the _Cell Capability Container FDD_ IE]
[3.84Mcps TDD -- the _Cell Capability Container TDD_ IE] [1.28Mcps TDD -- the
_Cell Capability Container TDD LCR_ IE] [7.68Mcps TDD -- the _Cell Capability
Container 7.68 Mcps TDD_ IE] [FDD -- and/or the _Cell Capability Container
Extension FDD_ IE] in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if the
accessed cell supports any functionalities listed in [FDD -- 9.2.2.D]
[3.84Mcps TDD -- 9.2.3.1a] [1.28Mcps TDD -- 9.2.3.1b] [7.68Mcps TDD --
9.2.3.31] [FDD -- 9.2.2.123].
[FDD -- If the cell is **multicell adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier
operation** capable and if the cell **can be the serving HS-DSCH then the
possible cells to serve multicell adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier
operation (same or adjacent sector in the same Node B) that can act as
secondary serving HS-DSCH shall be listed in the _Secondary Serving Cell List_
IE. For each cell in the _Secondary Serving Cell List_ IE that is** Multi Cell
E-DCH capable, indicated in the _Cell Capability Container Extension FDD_ IE
by the Multi Cell E-DCH Support Indicator bit **= \"1\", and is restricted for
use as an Additional E-DCH on the secondary uplink frequency with** the
accessed cell **as the** corresponding cell of the primary uplink frequency,
the DRNS shall, if supported, include the _Multicell E-DCH Restriction_ IE set
to \"TRUE\". **If the _Secondary Serving Cell List_ IE is not present, the
multicell (adjacent or non-adjacent carrier operation)** capable cell can only
serve as a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell in single band operation.**]**
[FDD -- If the cell is dual band capable and if the cell **can be the serving
HS-DSCH then the possible cells to serve dual band carrier operation (same
sector) that can act as secondary serving HS-DSCH shall be listed in the _Dual
Band Secondary Serving Cell List_ IE. If the _Dual Band Secondary Serving Cell
List_ IE is not present, the** dual band capable cell can only serve as a
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell in dual band operation.**]**
If MOCN or GWCN network sharing configuration is used then the DRNC shall
include the broadcasted PLMN identities of the concerned cell in the _Multiple
PLMN List_ IE in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message.
If available, the DRNC shall include the _SNA Information_ IE for the
concerned cell.
When receiving the _SNA Information_ IE, the SRNC should use it to restrict
cell access based on SNA information. See also TS 25.401 [40] for a broader
description of the SNA access control.
[FDD -- The DRNC shall include the _Cell Portion ID_ IE in the UPLINK
SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if available.]
[1.28 Mcps TDD -- The DRNC shall include the _Cell Portion LCR ID_ IE in the
UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message if available.]
[FDD -- If the propagation delay value exceeds the range of the _Propagation
Delay_ IE then the DRNC shall if supported include the _Extended Propagation
Delay_ IE and set the _Propagation Delay_ IE to its maximum value.]
If the _D-RNTI_ IE is not to be included in the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER
INDICATION message and the UE Link is currently stored in the UE Context in
the DRNC, the DRNC shall assume that the UE changes the cell under which it
camps in the DRNS (see TS 25.346 [50], section 5.1.6 on intra-DRNC cell
change). In this case, if an MBMS session for some MBMS bearer services
contained in the UE Link is ongoing in the cell identified by the _UC-ID_ IE,
the DRNC shall include in the _Active MBMS Bearer Service List_ IE the
_Transmission Mode_ IE for each of these active MBMS bearer services. Or else,
if the DRNC receives a Uu message on the CCCH in which the short identities
for MBMS Selected Services are included, and the Uu message requests for MBMS
PtP radio bearer establishment, the DRNC shall determine which TMGIs
correspond with the short identities and shall include in the _Active MBMS
Bearer Service List_ IE the _TMGI_ IE together with the _Transmission Mode_ IE
for each of these MBMS Selected Services.
If the CCCH message contains _Measurement results for monitored cells on non-
used frequencies_ IE in _Measured Result on RACH_ IE, the DRNC may include in
the UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message the _Inter-frequency Cell
List_ IE for each of the measured inter-freqeuncy cells. The order of cells in
_Measurement results for monitored cells on non-used frequencies_ IE in the
CCCH message shall be preserved in _Inter-frequency Cell List_ IE. If the _UL
UARFCN_ IE in the _Inter-frequency Cell List_ IE is not present, the default
duplex distance defined for the operating frequency band shall be used in the
SRNC (see TS 25.101 [43]).
[3.84 Mcps TDD -- the DRNC shall include the _Rx Timing Deviation_ IE unless
the cell to which the CCCH message was sent is configured to use the extended
timing advance in which case _Rx Timing Deviation 3.84Mcps Extended_ IE shall
be included.]
[7.68 Mcps TDD -- the DRNC shall include the _Rx Timing Deviation 7.68Mcps_ IE

### 8.2.1A GERAN Uplink Signalling Transfer
#### 8.2.1A.1 General
The procedure is used by the DBSS to forward an Um message received on the
SRB2 to the SBSS/SRNC. The procedure is also used by the DRNC to forward a Uu
message received on the CCCH to the SBSS.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of the signalling bearer.
#### 8.2.1A.2 Successful Operation
Figure 1A: GERAN Uplink Signalling Transfer procedure, Successful Operation
When the DBSS receives an Um message on the SRB2 in which the MS addressing
information is G-RNTI, i.e. S-RNTI and BSC-ID, DBSS shall send the GERAN
UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message to the SBSS/SRNC identified by
the BSC-ID received from the MS.
Alternatively, when the DRNC receives an Uu message on the CCCH in which the
UE addressing information is U-RNTI, i.e. S-RNTI and SRNC-ID, and in which the
SRNC-ID points to a GERAN BSS, the DRNC shall send the GERAN UPLINK SIGNALLING
TRANSFER INDICATION message to the SBSS identified by SRNC-ID received from
the UE.
If at least one GRA/URA Identity is being broadcast in the cell where the
Um/Uu message was received (the accessed cell), the DBSS/DRNC shall include a
GRA/URA Identity for this cell in the _URA ID_ IE, the _Multiple URAs
Indicator_ IE indicating whether or not multiple GRA/URA Identities are being
broadcast in the accessed cell, and the RNC/BSS Identity of all other RNC/BSSs
that are having at least one cell within the GRA/URA where the Um/Uu message
was received in the _URA Information_ IE in the GERAN UPLINK SIGNALLING
TRANSFER INDICATION message.
If no context exists for this UE/MS in the DBSS/DRNC, the DBSS/DRNC shall
create a UE Context for this UE/MS, allocate a D-RNTI for the UE Context, and
include the _D-RNTI_ IE and the identifiers for the CN CS Domain and CN PS
Domain that the DBSS/DRNC is connected to in the GERAN UPLINK SIGNALLING
TRANSFER INDICATION message. These CN Domain Identifiers shall be based on the
LAC and RAC respectively of the cell where the message was received from the
UE/MS.

message on the CCCH in a cell. When used, the procedure is in response to a
received Uplink Signalling Transfer procedure.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of the signalling bearer.
##### 8.2.2.1.1 Downlink Signalling Transfer for Iur-g
The procedure is used by the SRNC/SBSS to request to the DBSS the transfer of
an Um message on the SRB2 in a cell.
The procedure is used by the SBSS to request to the DRNC the transfer of a Uu
message on the CCCH in a cell.
#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 2: Downlink Signalling Transfer procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure consists of the DOWNLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER REQUEST message
sent by the SRNC to the DRNC.
The message contains the Cell Identifier (C-ID) contained in the received
UPLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER INDICATION message and the D-RNTI.
Upon receipt of the message, the DRNC shall send the L3 Information on the
CCCH in the cell indicated by the _C-ID_ IE to the UE identified by the _D-
RNTI_ IE.
If the _D-RNTI Release Indication_ IE is set to "Release D-RNTI" and the DRNS
has no dedicated resources (DCH, [TDD -- USCH and/or DSCH]) allocated for the
UE, the DRNS shall release the D-RNTI, the UE Context and any RACH and FACH
resources and any C-RNTI allocated to the UE Context upon receipt of the
DOWNLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER REQUEST message. If a UE Link is currently stored
in the UE Context, the DRNC shall perform UE De-linking as specified in TS
25.346 [50], section 5.1.6.
If the _D-RNTI Release Indication_ IE is set to "Release D-RNTI" and the DRNS
has dedicated resources allocated for the UE, the DRNS shall only release any
RACH and FACH resources and any C-RNTI allocated to the UE Context upon
receipt of the DOWNLINK SIGNALLING TRANSFER REQUEST message.
If the _MBMS Bearer Service List_ IE is included and _URA ID_ IE is not

## 8.3 Dedicated Procedures
### 8.3.1 Radio Link Setup
#### 8.3.1.1 General
This procedure is used for establishing the necessary resources in the DRNS
for one or more radio links.
The connection-oriented service of the signalling bearer shall be established
in conjunction with this procedure.
#### 8.3.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 5: Radio Link Setup procedure: Successful Operation
When the SRNC makes an algorithmic decision to add the first cell or set of
cells from a DRNS to the active set of a specific UE-UTRAN connection, the
RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message is sent to the corresponding DRNC to request
establishment of the radio link(s). The Radio Link Setup procedure is
initiated with this RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message sent from the SRNC to the
DRNC.
Upon receipt of the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message, the DRNS shall reserve
the necessary resources and configure the new RL(s) according to the
parameters given in the message. Unless specified below, the meaning of
parameters is specified in other specifications.
The DRNS shall prioritise resource allocation for the RL(s) to be established
according to Annex A.
If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes the _Allowed Queuing Time_ IE
the DRNS may queue the request for a time period not to exceed the value of
the _Allowed Queuing Time_ IE before starting to execute the request.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is contained in the RADIO LINK SETUP
REQUEST message, the DRNS shall, if supported, store the received UE Aggregate
Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of non GBR
traffic for this UE.
If the _Usefulness of Battery Optimization_ IE is contained in the RADIO LINK
SETUP REQUEST message, the DRNC may store the received value and use it to
determine whether this UE can benefit from battery optimization techniques.
**Transport Channels Handling:**
**DCH(s):**
[TDD -- If the _DCH Information_ IE is present in the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST
message, the DRNS shall configure the new DCHs according to the parameters
given in the message.]
If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes a _DCH Information_ IE with
multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs, then the DRNS shall treat the DCHs in the
_DCH Information_ IE as a set of co-ordinated DCHs.
If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_ IE
set to "Uplink DCH only", the DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE
for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a
part of the downlink CCTrCH.
If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_ IE
set to "Downlink DCH only", the DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_
IE for the uplink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a
part of the uplink CCTrCH.
[FDD -- For each DCH which do not belong to a set of co-ordinated DCHs, and
which includes a _QE-Selector_ IE set to "selected", the DRNS shall use the
Transport channel BER from that DCH for the QE in the UL data frames. If no
Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use
the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427 [4]. If the _QE-Selector_ IE is
set to "non-selected", the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE
in the UL data frames, TS 25.427 [4].]
For a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the DRNS shall use the Transport channel BER
from the DCH with the _QE-Selector_ IE set to "selected" for the QE in the UL
data frames, TS 25.427 [4]. [FDD -- If no Transport channel BER is available
for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE,
TS 25.427 [4]. If all DCHs have _QE-Selector_ IE set to "non-selected", the
DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427 [4].] [TDD -- If
no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use
0 for the QE, TS 25.427 [4].]
The DRNS shall use the included _UL DCH FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs as the DCH FP Mode in the Uplink of the user plane for the DCH
or the set of co-ordinated DCHs.
The DRNS shall use the included _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated
DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the user plane for the DCH or
the set of co-ordinated DCHs.
The DRNS shall use the included _ToAWE_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated
DCHs as the Time of Arrival Window Endpoint in the user plane for the DCH or
the set of co-ordinated DCHs.
The _Frame Handling Priority_ IE defines the priority level that should be
used by the DRNS to prioritise between different frames of the data frames of
the DCHs in the downlink on the radio interface in congestion situations once
the new RL(s) have been activated.
The _Traffic Class_ IE may be used to determine the transport bearer
characteristics to apply between DRNC and Node B for the related DCH or set of
co-ordinated DCHs. The DRNC should ignore the _Traffic Class_ IE if the _TrCH
Source Statistics Descriptor_ IE indicates the value "RRC".
If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and if
ALCAP is not used, the _TNL QoS_ IE may be used by the DRNS to determine the
transport bearer characteristics to apply in the uplink for the related DCH or
set of co-ordinated DCHs.
If the _DCH Information_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE, the DRNS shall treat the included IEs
according to the following:
\- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed UL Rate_
IE, the DRNS shall apply the Guaranteed Rate in the uplink of this DCH. The
DRNS may decide to request the SRNC to limit the user rate of the uplink of
the DCH at any point in time. The DRNS may request the SRNC to reduce the user
rate of the uplink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate, however, whenever
possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to only reduce the user rate between
the maximum bit rate and the guaranteed bit rate. If the _DCH Specific Info_
IE in the _DCH Information_ IE does not include the _Guaranteed UL Rate_ IE,
the DRNS shall not limit the user rate of the uplink of the DCH.
\- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed DL Rate_
IE, the DRNS shall apply the Guaranteed Rate in the downlink of this DCH. The
DRNS may decide to request the SRNC to limit the user rate of the downlink of
the DCH at any point in time. The DRNS may request the SRNC to reduce the user
rate of the downlink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate, however,
whenever possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to only reduce the user
rate between the maximum bit rate and the guaranteed bit rate. If the _DCH
Specific Info_ IE in the _DCH Information_ IE does not include the _Guaranteed
DL Rate_ IE, the DRNS shall not limit the user rate of the downlink of the
DCH.
[FDD -- If the RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST message includes the _Transport Bearer
Not Requested Indicator_ IE set to "Transport Bearer shall not be Established"

the _USCH information_ IE to map each _RB Identity_ IE to the corresponding
USCH. If the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and _Binding ID_ IE are included in
the _USCH Information_ IE the DRNC may use the transport layer address and the
binding identifier received from the SRNC when establishing a transport bearer
for the USCH.]
[TDD -- If the _USCH Information_ IE is included in the RADIO LINK SETUP
REQUEST message, the DRNS may use the _Traffic Class_ IE to determine the

DSCH serving cell List_ IE in the _Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE,
the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to HS-DSCH
serving cells associated with _C-ID_ IE included in _Affected HS-DSCH serving

precoding weights for the concerned UE Context.]
\- [FDD - If there is a HS-DSCH RL configuration in the concerned UE Context,

**General:**
[FDD -- The DRNS shall use the provided Uplink SIR Target value as the current
target for the inner-loop power control.]
**Radio Link Handling:**
**Diversity Combination Control:**
The _Diversity Control Field_ IE indicates for each RL whether the DRNS shall
combine the new RL with existing RL(s) or not on the Iur.
\- If the _Diversity Control Field_ IE is set to "May" (be combined with
another RL), the DRNS shall decide for any of the alternatives.
\- If the _Diversity Control Field_ IE is set to "Must", the DRNS shall
combine the RL with one of the other RL. When a new RL is to be combined the
DRNS shall choose which RL(s) to combine it with.
\- If the _Diversity Control Field_ IE is set to "Must not", the DRNS shall
not combine the RL with any other existing RL.
[FDD -- The _Diversity Control Field_ IE is only applicable for DCHs, in case
of E-DCH it shall always be assumed to be set to "May".]

LINK ADDITION RESPONSE the _Transport Bearer Not Setup Indicator_ IE for every
E-DCH MAC-d flow for which establishment of a transport bearer has not taken
place as a result of information in the _Transport Bearer Not Requested_
_Indicator_ IE in the RADIO LINK ADDITION REQUEST message.]
In the case of combining with a RL established with a previous Radio Link
Setup or Radio Link Addition Procedure or with a RL previously listed in this

combined and if the ALCAP is not used [FDD -- and the transport bearer for
this DCH is already established], the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and the
_Binding ID_ IE in the _RL Specific DCH Information_ IE included in the _RL
Information_ IE for a specific RL in the RADIO LINK ADDITION REQUEST message,
shall not be used.
[FDD -- In the case of combining with an E-DCH RL established with a previous

configuration, then:]
\- [FDD -- the DRNS shall follow the rules defined in this procedure for
single carrier mode of operation for establishment of the transport bearer for
a MAC-d flow and use the _Transport Bearer Not Requested Indicator_ IE in the
_RL Specific E-DCH Information_ IE in the _RL Information_ IE received for the
corresponding Radio Link(s) of the Primary Uplink Frequency to determine the
transport bearer configuration in the new configuration for the radio links of

inner loop power control or power balancing shall be performed during this
period. The DL power shall then vary according to the inner loop power control
(see TS 25.214 [10] subclause 5.2.1.2) and the power control procedure (see
8.3.7).]
[TDD -- The Initial DL TX Power shall be applied until UL synchronisation is

### 8.3.3 Radio Link Deletion
#### 8.3.3.1 General
The Radio Link Deletion procedure is used to release the resources in a DRNS
for one or more established radio links towards a UE.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE
Context.
The Radio Link Deletion procedure may be initiated by the SRNC at any time
after establishing a Radio Link.
#### 8.3.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 9: Radio Link Deletion procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a RADIO LINK DELETION REQUEST message sent
from the SRNC to the DRNC.
Upon receipt of this message, the DRNS shall delete the radio link(s)
identified by the _RL ID_ IE(s) in the message, shall release all associated
resources and shall respond to the SRNC with a RADIO LINK DELETION RESPONSE
message.
If the radio link(s) to be deleted represent the last radio link(s) for the UE
in the DRNS and if the UE is not using any common resources in the DRNS, then
the DRNC shall release the UE Context.
[FDD -- After deletion of the RL(s), the UL out-of-sync algorithm defined in
TS 25.214 [10] shall for each of the remaining RL Set(s) use the maximum value

#### 8.3.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the RL indicated by the _RL ID_ IE does not exist, the DRNC shall respond
with the RADIO LINK DELETION RESPONSE message.
### 8.3.4 Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation
#### 8.3.4.1 General
The Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure is used to
prepare a new configuration of Radio Link(s) related to one UE-UTRAN
connection within a DRNS.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE
Context.
The Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure shall not be
initiated if a Prepared Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1.
#### 8.3.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 10: Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure,
Successful Operation
The Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure is initiated
by the SRNC by sending the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message to the
DRNC.
Upon receipt, the DRNS shall reserve necessary resources for the new
configuration of the Radio Link(s) according to the parameters given in the
message. Unless specified below, the meaning of parameters is specified in
other specifications.
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message includes the _Allowed
Queuing Time_ IE the DRNS may queue the request the time corresponding to the
value of the _Allowed Queuing Time_ IE before starting to execute the request.
The DRNS shall prioritise resource allocation for the RL(s) to be modified
according to Annex A.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is contained in the RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message, the DRNS shall, if supported, store the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate
data rate of non GBR traffic for this UE.
**DCH Modification:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message includes any _DCHs To
Modify_ IEs, the DRNS shall treat them each as follows:
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs then
the DRNS shall treat the DCHs in the _DCHs To Modify_ IE as a set of co-
ordinated DCHs. The DRNS shall include these DCHs in the new configuration
only if it can include all of them in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set
of co-ordinated DCHs to be modified, the DRNS shall apply the new FP Mode in
the Uplink of the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in
the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of
co-ordinated DCHs to be modified, the DRNS shall apply the new ToAWS in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _ToAWE_ IE for a DCH or a set of
co-ordinated DCHs to be modified, the DRNS shall apply the new ToAWE in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE for a DCH to be modified, the DRNS should
store this information for this DCH in the new configuration. The received
Frame Handling Priority should be used when prioritising between different
frames in the downlink on the radio interface in congestion situations within
the DRNS once the new configuration has been activated.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Traffic Class_ IE for a DCH to be modified, the DRNS should store this
information for this DCH in the new configuration. The _Traffic Class_ IE may
be used to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply between
DRNC and Node B for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs. The DRNC
should ignore the _Traffic Class_ IE if the _TrCH Source Statistics
Descriptor_ IE for this DCH indicates the value "RRC".
\- [FDD -- If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to "Uplink DCH only", the
DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the downlink for this DCH.
As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the downlink CCTrCH.]
\- [FDD -- If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to " Downlink DCH only",
the DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the uplink for this
DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the uplink
CCTrCH.]
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the UL of a DCH to be modified, the DRNS
shall apply the new Transport Format Set in the Uplink of this DCH in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE includes the _TNL QoS_ IE for a DCH or a set of
co-ordinated DCHs to be modified and if ALCAP is not used, the DRNS may store
this information for this DCH in the new configuration. The _TNL QoS_ IE may
be used to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply in the
uplink for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the DL of a DCH to be modified, the DRNS
shall apply the new Transport Format Set in the Downlink of this DCH in the
new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, the DRNS shall apply the new
Allocation/Retention Priority to this DCH in the new configuration according
to Annex A.
\- [TDD -- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _CCTrCH ID_ IE for the UL,
the DRNS shall map the DCH onto the referenced UL CCTrCH in the new
configuration.]
\- [TDD -- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _CCTrCH ID_ IE for the DL,
the DRNS shall map the DCH onto the referenced DL CCTrCH in the new
configuration.]
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE, the DRNS shall treat the included IEs
according to the following:
\- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed UL Rate_
IE, the DRNS shall apply the new Guaranteed Rate in the uplink of this DCH in
the new configuration. The DRNS may decide to request the SRNC to limit the
user rate in the uplink of the DCH at any point in time after activating the
new configuration. The DRNS may request the SRNC to reduce the user rate of
the uplink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate, however, whenever
possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to reduce the user rate between the
maximum bit rate and the guaranteed bit rate.
\- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed DL Rate_
IE, the DRNS shall apply the new Guaranteed Rate in the downlink of this DCH
in the new configuration. The DRNS may decide to request the SRNC to limit the
user rate in the downlink of the DCH at any point in time after activating the
new configuration. The DRNS may request the SRNC to reduce the user rate of
the downlink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate, however, whenever
possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to reduce the user rate between the
maximum bit rate and the guaranteed bit rate.
**DCH Addition:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE message includes any _DCHs To Add_
IEs, the DRNS shall treat them each as follows:
\- The DRNS shall reserve necessary resources for the new configuration of the
Radio Link(s) according to the parameters given in the message and include
these DCH in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCH Information_ IE includes a _DCHs To Add_ IE with multiple _DCH
Specific Info_ IEs, the DRNS shall treat the DCHs in the _DCHs To Add_ IE as a
set of co-ordinated DCHs. The DRNS shall include these DCHs in the new
configuration only if it can include all of them in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to "Uplink DCH only", the DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_
IE for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as
a part of the downlink CCTrCH.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to "Downlink DCH only", the DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format
Set_ IE for the uplink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included
as a part of the uplink CCTrCH.
\- [FDD -- For each DCH which do not belong to a set of co-ordinated DCHs and
which includes a _QE-Selector_ IE set to "selected", the DRNS shall use the
Transport channel BER from that DCH for the QE in the UL data frames. If no
Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use
the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427 [4]. If the _QE-Selector_ IE is
set to "non-selected", the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE
in the UL data frames, TS 25.427 [4].]
\- For a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the DRNS shall use the Transport channel
BER from the DCH with the _QE-Selector_ IE set to "selected" for the QE in the
UL data frames, TS 25.427 [4]. [FDD -- If no Transport channel BER is
available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER
for the QE, TS 25.427 [4]. If all DCHs have the _QE-Selector_ IE set to "non-
selected", the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427
[4].] [TDD -- If no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH,
the DRNS shall use 0 for the QE, TS 25.427 [4].]
\- The DRNS should store the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE received for a DCH
to be added in the new configuration. The received Frame Handling Priority
should be used when prioritising between different frames in the downlink on
the Uu interface in congestion situations within the DRNS once the new
configuration has been activated.
\- If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and
if ALCAP is not used, the DRNS may use this information to determine the
transport bearer characteristics to apply for the uplink for the related DCH
or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
\- The DRNS should store the _Traffic Class_ IE received for a DCH to be added
in the new configuration. The _Traffic Class_ IE may be used to determine the
transport bearer characteristics to apply between DRNC and Node B for the
related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs. The DRNC should ignore the _Traffic
Class_ IE if the _TrCH Source Statistics Descriptor_ IE indicates the value
"RRC".
\- The DRNS shall use the included _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new FP Mode in the Uplink of the user plane
for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new configuration.
\- The DRNS shall use the included _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
\- The DRNS shall use the included _ToAWE_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new Time of Arrival Window Endpoint in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.

\- If the _DCHs To Add_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE, the DRNS shall treat the included IEs
according to the following:
\- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed UL Rate_
IE, the DRNS shall apply the new Guaranteed Rate in the uplink of this DCH in
the new configuration. The DRNS may decide to request the SRNC to limit the
user rate of the uplink of the DCH at any point in time after activating the
new configuration. The DRNS may request the SRNC to reduce the user rate of
the uplink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate, however, whenever
possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to reduce the user rate between the

### 8.3.5 Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit
#### 8.3.5.1 General
This procedure is used to order the DRNS to switch to the new configuration
for the Radio Link(s) within the DRNS, previously prepared by the Synchronised
Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure.
When Mode 1 is used for the fast TTI switching, the procedure shall if
supported be used to order the DRNS to execute the TTI switching process.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE
Context.
#### 8.3.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 12: Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit procedure,
Successful Operation
[FDD - If the _Activation Delay_ IE is included in the RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message, the DRNS shall if supported send the HS-SCCH
order to execute the TTI switching process according to TS 25.214 [10]. The
_CFN_ IE in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message shall be ignored by
the DRNS.]
The DRNS shall switch to the new configuration previously prepared by the
Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure at the
"configuration switching point" occurring:
\- [TDD -- at the next coming CFN with a value equal to the value requested by
the SRNC in the _CFN_ IE (see TS 25.402 [17] subclause 9.4) when receiving the
RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message from the SRNC.]
\- [FDD -- if the _Fast Reconfiguration Mode_ IE is not included in the RADIO
LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message at the next coming CFN with a value equal
to the value requested by the SRNC in the _CFN_ IE (see TS 25.402 [17]
subclause 9.4) when receiving the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message
from the SRNC.]
\- [FDD -- if the _Fast Reconfiguration Mode_ IE is included in the RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message as soon as the DRNS detects that the UE uses
the new configuration in the uplink (e.g. the Node B indicates that the UE
uses the new scrambling code used for the uplink by sending the RADIO LINK
RESTORATION message). In order to limit the period for the detection in the
DRNS the CFN in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message indicates the
earliest possible time instant at which the UE might use the new
configuration.]
[FDD -- If the _Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE is included in the
RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message, the _CM Configuration Change CFN_
IE in the _Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE shall be ignored by the
DRNS.]
[FDD -- If the _Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE is not included in the
RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message and a new Compressed Mode
Configuration exists in the prepared configuration, the DRNS shall behave as
if an _Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE with an empty _Transmission Gap
Pattern Sequence Status_ IE was included.]
When this procedure has been completed the Prepared Reconfiguration does not
exist any more, see subclause 3.1.
In the case of a Transport Channel or MAC-d flow modification for which a new
transport bearer was requested and established, the switch to the new
transport bearer shall also take place at the configuration switching point
(defined above) indicated CFN.
The detailed frame protocol handling during transport bearer replacement is
described in TS 25.427 [4], subclause 5.10.1, and in TS 25.425 [32],
subclauses 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.
[FDD -- If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT includes the _Active Pattern
Sequence Information_ IE, the DRNS shall deactivate all the ongoing
Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences at the configuration switching point
(defined above). From that moment on all Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences
included in _Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence Status_ IE repetitions shall be
started when the indicated _TGCFN_ IE elapses. The _CFN_ IE and _TGCFN_ IE for
each sequence refer to the next coming CFN with that value. If the values of
the _CFN_ IE and the _TGCFN_ IE are equal, the concerned Transmission Gap
Pattern Sequence shall be started immediately at the CFN with a value equal to
the value received in the _CFN_ IE.]
[FDD -- If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message includes the _Active
Pattern Sequence Information_ IE and the concerned UE Context is configured to
use F-DPCH in the downlink, the DRNS shall ignore, when activating the
Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence(s), the downlink compressed mode method
information, if existing, for the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern
Sequence(s) in the Compressed Mode Configuration.]
[FDD - If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message includes the _Affected
HS-DSCH serving cell List_ IE in the _Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE,
the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to HS-DSCH
serving cells associated with _C-ID_ IE included in _Affected HS-DSCH serving
cell List_ IE. Otherwise the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall
be applied to all the configured serving cells.]
#### 8.3.5.3 Abnormal Conditions
If a new transport bearer is required for the new configuration and it is not
available at the requested configuration switching point (defined in sub-
clause 8.3.3.2), the DRNS shall initiate the Radio Link Failure procedure.
[FDD -- If the _Fast Reconfiguration Mode_ IE is included in the RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message and the DRNC did not include the _Fast
ReconfigurationPermission_ IE in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION READY message,
the DRNC shall initiate the Radio Link Failure procedure.]
[FDD - If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message contains the _Affected
HS-DSCH serving cell List_ IE in the _Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE
and theTransmission Gap Pattern Sequence for affected HS-DSCH Serving Cells is
activated on the HS-DSCH Primary Serving Cell but not for all the other
serving cells, the DRNS shall initiate the Radio Link Failure procedure with
the cause value "Invalid CM Settings".]
[FDD - If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message contains the
_Activation Delay_ IE but the _Fast TTI switching Mode Requested Synchronized_
IE is not presented in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE or the Mode 1 is
not supported, the DRNS shall initiate the Radio Link Failure procedure.]
### 8.3.6 Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Cancellation
#### 8.3.6.1 General
This procedure is used to order the DRNS to release the new configuration for
the Radio Link(s) within the DRNS, previously prepared by the Synchronised
Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE
Context.
#### 8.3.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 13: Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Cancellation procedure,
Successful Operation
Upon receipt of the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION CANCEL message from the SRNC,
the DRNS shall release the new configuration ([FDD -- including the new
Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence parameters (if existing)]) previously
prepared by the Synchronised RL Reconfiguration Preparation procedure and
continue using the old configuration. When this procedure has been completed
the Prepared Reconfiguration does not exist any more, see subclause 3.1.
#### 8.3.6.3 Abnormal Conditions
-
### 8.3.7 Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration
#### 8.3.7.1 General
The Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure is used to reconfigure
Radio Link(s) related to one UEâ€‘UTRAN connection within a DRNS.
The procedure is used when there is no need to synchronise the time of the
switching from the old to the new radio link configuration in the cells used
by the UE-UTRAN connection within the DRNS.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE
Context.
The Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure shall not be initiated
if a Prepared Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1.
#### 8.3.7.2 Successful Operation
Figure 14: Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure, Successful
Operation
The Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure is initiated by the
SRNC by sending the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message to the DRNC.
Upon receipt, the DRNS shall modify the configuration of the Radio Link(s)
according to the parameters given in the message. Unless specified below, the
meaning of parameters is specified in other specifications.
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes the _Allowed
Queuing Time_ IE the DRNS may queue the request the time corresponding to the
value of the _Allowed Queuing Time_ IE before starting to execute the request.
The DRNS shall prioritise resource allocation for the RL to be modified
according to Annex A.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is contained in the RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message, the DRNS shall, if supported, store the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate
data rate of non GBR traffic for this UE.
**DCH Modification:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes any _DCHs To
Modify_ IEs, then the DRNS shall treat them as follows:
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs, then
the DRNS shall treat the DCHs as a set of co-ordinated DCHs. The DRNS shall
include these DCHs in the new configuration only if it can include all of them
in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set
of co-ordinated DCHs to be modified, the DRNS shall apply the new FP Mode in
the Uplink of the user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in
the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of
co-ordinated DCHs to be modified, the DRNS shall apply the new ToAWS in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE includes the _ToAWE_ IE for a DCH or a set of
co-ordinated DCHs to be modified, the DRNS shall apply the new ToAWE in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
a _Transport Format Set_ IE for the UL of a DCH to be modified, the DRNS shall
apply the new Transport Format Set in the Uplink of this DCH in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
a _Transport Format Set_ IE for the DL of a DCH to be modified, the DRNS shall
apply the new Transport Format Set in the Downlink of this DCH in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE, the DRNS should store this information for
this DCH in the new configuration. The received Frame Handling Priority should
be used when prioritising between different frames in the downlink on the
radio interface in congestion situations within the DRNS once the new
configuration has been activated.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Traffic Class_ IE, the DRNC may
use this information to determine the transport bearer characteristics to
apply between DRNC and Node B for the related DCH or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
The DRNC should ignore the _Traffic Class_ IE if the _TrCH Source Statistics
Descriptor_ IE for this DCH indicates the value "RRC".
\- [FDD -- If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to "Uplink DCH only", the
DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the downlink for this DCH.
As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the downlink CCTrCH.]
\- [FDD -- If the _DCHs to Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _Unidirectional DCH indicator_ IE set to "Downlink DCH only", the
DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_ IE for the uplink for this DCH.
As a consequence this DCH is not included as a part of the uplink CCTrCH.]
\- If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and
if ALCAP is not used, the DRNS may use this information to determine the
transport bearer characteristics to apply for the uplink for the related DCH
or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, the DRNS shall apply the new
Allocation/Retention Priority to this DCH in the new configuration according
to Annex A.
\- [TDD -- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _CCTrCH ID_ IE for the UL, the DRNS shall map the DCH onto the
referenced UL CCTrCH in the new configuration.]
\- [TDD -- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which
includes the _CCTrCH ID_ IE for the DL, the DRNS shall map the DCH onto the
referenced DL CCTrCH in the new configuration.]
\- If the _DCHs To Modify_ IE contains a _DCH Specific Info_ IE which includes
the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE, the DRNS shall treat the included IEs
according to the following:
\- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed UL Rate_
IE, the DRNS shall apply the new Guaranteed Rate in the uplink of this DCH in
the new configuration. The DRNS may decide to request the SRNC to limit the
user rate in the uplink of the DCH at any point in time after activating the
new configuration. The DRNS may request the SRNC to reduce the user rate of
the uplink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate, however, whenever
possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to reduce the user rate between the
maximum bit rate and the guaranteed bit rate.
> \- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed DL
> Rate_ IE, the DRNS shall apply the new Guaranteed Rate in the downlink of
> this DCH in the new configuration. The DRNS may decide to request the SRNC

> the user rate of the downlink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate,
> however, whenever possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to reduce the
> user rate between the maximum bit rate and the guaranteed bit rate.
**DCH Addition:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes any _DCHs To Add_
IEs, then the DRNS shall treat them each as follows:
\- The DRNS shall reserve necessary resources for the new configuration of the
Radio Link(s) according to the parameters given in the message and include
these DCH in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCHs To Add_ IE includes multiple _DCH Specific Info_ IEs then the
DRNS shall treat the DCHs in the _DCHs To Add_ IE as a set of co-ordinated
DCHs. The DRNS shall include these DCHs in the new configuration only if all
of them can be in the new configuration.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to "Uplink DCH only", the DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format Set_
IE for the downlink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included as
a part of the downlink CCTrCH.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Unidirectional DCH Indicator_
IE set to "Downlink DCH only", the DRNS shall ignore the _Transport Format
Set_ IE for the uplink for this DCH. As a consequence this DCH is not included
as a part of the uplink CCTrCH.
\- [FDD -- For each DCH which does not belong to a set of co-ordinated DCHs,
and which includes a _QE-Selector_ IE set to "selected", the DRNS shall use
the Transport channel BER from that DCH for the QE in the UL data frames. If
no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use
the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427 [4]. If the _QE-Selector_ IE is
set to "non-selected", the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE
in the UL data frames, TS 25.427 [4].]
\- For a set of co-ordinated DCHs, the DRNS shall use the Transport channel
BER from the DCH with the _QEâ€‘Selector_ IE set to "selected" for the QE in the
UL data frames, TS 25.427 [4]. [FDD -- If no Transport channel BER is
available for the selected DCH, the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER
for the QE, TS 25.427 [4]. If all DCHs have the _QE-Selector_ IE set to "non-
selected", the DRNS shall use the Physical channel BER for the QE, TS 25.427
[4].] [TDD -- If no Transport channel BER is available for the selected DCH,
the DRNS shall use 0 for the QE, TS 25.427 [4].]
\- The DRNS should store the _Frame Handling Priority_ IE received for a DCH
to be added in the new configuration. The received Frame Handling Priority
should be used when prioritising between different frames in the downlink on
the Uu interface in congestion situations within the DRNS once the new
configuration has been activated.
\- The _Traffic Class_ IE may be used to determine the transport bearer
characteristics to apply between DRNC and Node B for the related DCH or set of
co-ordinated DCHs. The DRNC should ignore the _Traffic Class_ IE if the _TrCH
Source Statistics Descriptor_ IE indicates the value "RRC".
\- If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included for a DCH or a set of co-ordinated DCHs and
if ALCAP is not used, the DRNS may use this information to determine the
transport bearer characteristics to apply for the uplink for the related DCH
or set of co-ordinated DCHs.
\- The DRNS shall use the included _UL FP Mode_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new FP Mode in the Uplink of the user plane
for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new configuration.
\- The DRNS shall use the included _ToAWS_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new Time of Arrival Window Startpoint in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
\- The DRNS shall use the included _ToAWE_ IE for a DCH or a set of co-
ordinated DCHs to be added as the new Time of Arrival Window Endpoint in the
user plane for the DCH or the set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
\- If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE includes the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_
IE, the DRNS shall treat the included IEs according to the following:
\- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed UL Rate_
IE, the DRNS shall apply the new Guaranteed Rate in the uplink of this DCH in
the new configuration. The DRNS may decide to request the SRNC to limit the
user rate of the uplink of the DCH at any point in time after activating the
new configuration. The DRNS may request the SRNC to reduce the user rate of
the uplink of the DCH below the guaranteed bit rate, however, whenever
possible the DRNS should request the SRNC to reduce the user rate between the
maximum bit rate and the guaranteed bit rate. If the _DCH Specific Info_ IE in
the _DCH Information_ IE does not include the _Guaranteed UL Rate_ IE, the
DRNS shall not limit the user rate of the uplink of the DCH.
> \- If the _Guaranteed Rate_ _Information_ IE includes the _Guaranteed DL
> Rate_ IE, the DRNS shall apply the new Guaranteed Rate in the downlink of

> uplink of the DCH.
**DCH Deletion:**
If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes any _DCHs To
Delete_ IEs, the DRNS shall not include the referenced DCHs in the new
configuration.
If all of the DCHs belonging to a set of co-ordinated DCHs are requested to be
deleted, the DRNS shall not include this set of co-ordinated DCHs in the new
configuration.
**[FDD -- Physical Channel Modification:]**
[FDD -- If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes an _UL DPCH

activated. This new Compressed Mode Configuration shall be valid in the DRNS
until the next Compressed Mode Configuration is configured in the DRNS or last
Radio Link is deleted.]
[FDD -- If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes the
_Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence Information_ IE, and if the _Downlink
Compressed Mode Method_ in one or more Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence
within the _Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence Information_ IE is set to
"SF/2", the DRNC shall include the _DL Code Information_ IE in the RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION RESPONSE message, without changing any of the DL
Channelisation Codes or DL Scrambling Codes, indicating for each DL
Channelisation Code whether the alternative scrambling code shall be used or
not.]
[FDD -- If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes an _E-DPCH
Information_ IE which contains the _E-TFCS Information_ IE, the DRNS shall use
the _E-TFCS Information_ IE for the E-DCH when reserving resources for the
uplink of the new configuration. The DRNS shall apply the new TFCS in the
uplink of the new configuration. If the _E-TFCS Information_ IE contains the
_E-DCH Minimum Set E-TFCI_ _Validity Indicator_ IE the DRNS shall ignore the

resource allocation operation.]
[FDD -- If the _E-TFCS Information_ IE in the _E-DPCH Information_ IE contains
the _E-DPDCH Power Interpolation_ IE, the DRNS shall use the value to
determine the applicable E-DPDCH power formula defined in TS 25.214 [10]. If

then the DRNS shall use the value to determine the applicable minimum gain
factor (_Î²~ed,k,reduced,min~_) defined in TS 25.214 [10]. For the case the
_Minimum Reduced E-DPDCH Gain Factor_ IE is not available for the UE Context,
the DRNS may use the default value defined in TS 25.331 [16]. ]
[FDD -- If the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message includes the

#### 8.3.8.4 Abnormal Conditions
While waiting for the PHYSICAL CHANNEL Reconfiguration Command message, if the
DRNC receives any of the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE, RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION REQUEST, or RADIO LINK DELETION REQUEST messages, the DRNC
shall abort the Physical Channel Reconfiguration procedure. These messages
thus override the DRNC request for physical channel reconfiguration.
When the SRNC receives a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION REQUEST message
while a Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure, Unsynchronised
Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure or Radio Link Deletion procedure is
ongoing, the SRNC shall ignore the request message and assume that receipt of
any of the messages RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION PREPARE, RADIO LINK
RECONFIGURATION REQUEST or RADIO LINK DELETION REQUEST by the DRNC has
terminated the Physical Channel Reconfiguration procedure. In this case the
SRNC shall not send a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION FAILURE message to the
DRNC.
### 8.3.9 Radio Link Failure
#### 8.3.9.1 General
This procedure is started by the DRNS when one or more Radio Links [FDD \-- or

Set(s)] [TDD -- or CCTrCHs within a Radio Link] are no longer available, it
shall send the RADIO LINK FAILURE INDICATION message to the SRNC. The message
indicates the failed Radio Link(s) [FDD -- or Radio Link Set(s)] [TDD -- or
CCTrCHs] with the most appropriate cause values defined in the _Cause_ IE. If
the failure concerns one or more individual Radio Links the DRNC shall include
the affected Radio Link(s) using the _RL Information_ IE. [FDD -- If the
failure concerns one or more Radio Link Set(s) the DRNC shall include the
affected Radio Link Set(s) using the _RL Set Information_ IE.] [TDD -- If the
failure concerns only the failure of one or more CCTrCHs within in a radio
link the DRNC shall include the affected CCTrCHs using the _CCTrCH ID_ IE.]
When the RL Failure procedure is used to notify loss of UL synchronisation of
a [FDD -- Radio Link Set] [TDD -- Radio Link or CCTrCHs within a Radio Link]
on the Uu interface, the RADIO LINK FAILURE INDICATION message shall be sent
with the _Cause_ IE set to "Synchronisation Failure" when indicated by the UL
synchronisation detection algorithm defined in TS 25.214 [10] subclause 4.3
and TS 25.224 [22] subclause 4.4.2.
[FDD -- When the Radio Link Failure procedure is used to indicate permanent
failure in one or more Radio Link(s)/Radio Link Set(s) due to the occurrence
of an UL or DL frame with more than one transmission gap caused by one or more
compressed mode pattern sequences, the DL transmission shall be stopped and
the RADIO LINK FAILURE INDICATION message shall be sent with the _Cause_ IE
set to "Invalid CM Settings". After sending the RADIO LINK FAILURE INDICATION
message to notify the permanent failure, the DRNS shall not remove the Radio
Link(s)/Radio Link Set(s) from the UE Context, or remove the UE Context
itself.]
[FDD -- When the Radio Link Failure Procedure is used to indicate E-DCH non
serving cell processing issue, the RADIO LINK FAILURE INDICATION shall be
sent, with the _Cause_ IE set to "Not enough user plane processing
resources".]
In the other cases the Radio Link Failure procedure is used to indicate that
one or more Radio Link(s) [FDD -- or Radio Link Set(s)] are permanently
unavailable and cannot be restored. After sending the RADIO LINK FAILURE
INDICATION message to notify the permanent failure, the DRNS shall not remove
the Radio Link from the UE Context, or remove the UE Context itself. When
applicable, the allocation retention priorities associated with the transport
channels shall be used by the DRNS to prioritise which Radio Links to indicate
as unavailable to the SRNC.
Typical cause values are:
**Radio Network Layer Causes:**
Synchronisation Failure;
Invalid CM Settings.
**Transport Layer Causes:**
Transport Resources Unavailable.
**Miscellaneous Causes:**
Control Processing Overload;
HW Failure;
O&M Intervention;
Not enough user plane processing resources.

Figure 20: Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message sent from the SRNC to the DRNC.
Upon receipt, the DRNC shall initiate the requested dedicated measurement
according to the parameters given in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION
REQUEST message.
If the Dedicated Measurement Object Type is indicated as being "RL" in the
DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement results shall be
reported for all the indicated Radio Links.
[FDD -- If the Dedicated Measurement Object Type is indicated as being "RLS"
in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement results
shall be reported for all the indicated Radio Link Sets.]
[FDD -- If the Dedicated Measurement Object Type is indicated as being "ALL
RL" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement
results shall be reported for all current and future Radio Links within the UE
Context.]
[TDD -- If the Dedicated Measurement Object Type is indicated as being "ALL
RL" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement
results shall be reported for one existing DPCH per CCTrCH in each used time
slot of current and future Radio Links within the UE Context, provided the
measurement type is applicable to the respective DPCH.]
[FDD -- If the Dedicated Measurement Object Type is indicated as being "ALL
RLS" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, measurement
results shall be reported for all the existing and future Radio Link Sets
within the UE Context.]
[TDD -- If the _DPCH ID_ IE or _DPCH ID 7.68Mcps_ IE is provided within the RL
Information, the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical
channel individually. If no _DPCH ID_ IE, _DPCH ID 7.68Mcps_ IE or _HS-SICH
ID_ IE is provided within the RL Information the measurement request shall
apply for one existing DPCH per CCTrCH in each used time slot of the Radio
Link, provided the measurement type is applicable to this DPCH.]
[TDD -- If the _HS-SICH Information_ IE is provided within the RL Information,
the measurement request shall apply for the requested physical channel
individually.]
[TDD -- If the _Dedicated Measurement Type_ IE is set to "HS-SICH reception
quality ", the DRNS shall initiate measurements of the failed, missed and
total HS-SICH transmissions on all of the HS-SICH assigned to this UE Context.
If either the failed or missed HS-SICH transmission satisfies the requested
report characteristics, the DRNS shall report the result of both failed and
missed transmission measurements along with the total number of
transmissions.]
**Report characteristics**
The _Report Characteristics_ IE indicates how the reporting of the dedicated
measurement shall be performed. See also Annex B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "On Demand" and if the _CFN_ IE
is not provided, the DRNS shall report the measurement result immediately in
the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message. If the _CFN_ IE is
provided, it indicates the frame for which the measurement value shall be
provided. The provided measurement value shall be the one reported by the
layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302
[26]).
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Periodic" and if the _CFN_ IE is
not provided, the DRNS shall immediately and periodically initiate the
Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure for this measurement, with a
frequency as specified by the _Report Periodicity_ IE. If the _CFN_ IE is
provided, the DRNS shall initiate a Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure
for this measurement at the CFN indicated in the _CFN_ IE, and shall repeat
this initiation periodically thereafter with a frequency as specified by the
_Report Periodicity_ IE. The provided measurement value shall be the one
reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [26]).
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event A", the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity rises above the requested threshold, as specified by the _Measurement
Threshold_ IE, and then stays above the threshold for the requested hysteresis
time, as specified by the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE. If the
_Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the DRNC shall use the
value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event B", the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity falls below the requested threshold, as specified by the _Measurement
Threshold_ IE, and then stays below the threshold for the requested hysteresis
time, as specified by the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE. If the
_Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the DRNC shall use the
value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event C", the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity rises more than the requested threshold specified by the _Measurement
Increase/Decrease Threshold_ IE, and only when this rise occurs within the
requested rising time specified by the _Measurement Change Time_ IE. After
reporting this type of event, DRNS shall not initiate the next C event
reporting for the same measurement during the subsequent time specified by the
_Measurement Change Time_ IE.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event D", the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity falls more than the requested threshold specified by the _Measurement
Increase/Decrease Threshold_ IE, and only when this falls occurs within the
requested falling time specified by the _Measurement Change Time_ IE. After
reporting this type of event, the DRNS shall not initiate the next D event
reporting for the same measurement during the subsequent time specified by the
_Measurement Change Time_ IE.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event E", the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity rises above the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE and stays above the
threshold for the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE (Report A). When the
conditions for Report A are met and if the _Report Periodicity_ IE is
provided, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting
procedure periodically with the requested report frequency specified by the
_Report Periodicity_ IE. If the conditions for Report A have been met and the
measured entity falls below the _Measurement Threshold 2_ IE and stays below
the threshold for the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE, the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) and shall
terminate any corresponding periodic reporting. If the _Measurement Threshold
2_ IE is not present, the DRNS shall use the value of the _Measurement
Threshold 1_ IE instead. If the _Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not
included, the DRNC shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both
Report A and Report B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event F", the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured
entity falls below the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE and stays below the
threshold for the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE (Report A). When the
conditions for Report A are met and if the _Report Periodicity_ IE is
provided, the DRNS shall initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting
procedure periodically with the requested report frequency specified by the
_Report Periodicity_ IE. If the conditions for Report A have been met and the
measured entity rises above the _Measurement Threshold 2_ IE and stays above
the threshold for the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE, the DRNS shall
initiate the Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) and shall
terminate any corresponding periodic reporting. If the _Measurement Threshold
2_ IE is not present, the DRNS shall use the value of the _Measurement
Threshold 1_ IE instead. If the _Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not
included, the DRNC shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both
Report A and Report B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is not set to "On --Demand", the DRNS is
required to perform reporting for a dedicated measurement object, in
accordance with the conditions provided in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT
INITIATION REQUEST message, as long as the object exists. If no dedicated
measurement object(s) for which a measurement is defined exists any more, the
DRNS shall terminate the measurement locally without reporting this to the
SRNC.
If at the start of the measurement, the reporting criteria are fulfilled for
any of Event A, Event B, Event E or Event F, the DRNS shall initiate the
Dedicated Measurement Reporting procedure immediately, and then continue with
the measurements as specified in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message.
**Higher layer filtering**
The _Measurement Filter Coefficient_ IE indicates how filtering of the
dedicated measurement values shall be performed before measurement event
evaluation and reporting.
The averaging shall be performed according to the following formula.
The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
_F~n~_ is the updated filtered measurement result.
_F~n-1~_ is the old filtered measurement result.
_M~n~_ is the latest received measurement result from physical layer
measurements, the unit used for _M~n~_ is the same unit as the reported unit
in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE, DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT
messages or the unit used in the event evaluation (i.e. same unit as for Fn).
_A_ = Â½^(k/2)^ , where k is the parameter received in the _Measurement Filter
Coefficient_ IE. If the _Measurement Filter Coefficient_ IE is not present,
_a_ shall be set to 1 (no filtering)
In order to initialise the averaging filter, _F~0~_ is set to _M~1~_ when the
first measurement result from the physical layer measurement is received.
**Measurement Recovery Behavior:**
If the _Measurement Recovery Behavior_ IE is included in the DEDICATED
MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the DRNS shall, if Measurement
Recovery Behavior is supported, include the _Measurement Recovery Support
Indicator_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message and
perform the Measurement Recovery Behavior as described in subclause 8.3.12.2.
**Response message**
If the DRNS was able to initiate the measurement requested by the SRNS it
shall respond with the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message. The
message shall include the same Measurement ID that was used in the DEDICATED
MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message.
In the case in which the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "On Demand":
\- The DRNC shall include the measurement result in the _Dedicated Measurement
Value_ IE within the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.
\- If the _CFN Reporting Indicator_ IE is set to "FN Reporting Required", the
_CFN_ IE shall be included in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE
message. The reported CFN shall be the CFN at the time when the dedicated
measurement value was reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C
in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]).
\- [TDD -- If the measurement was made on a particular DPCH, the DEDICATED
MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message shall include the DPCH ID of that DPCH
in the [1.28Mcps TDD and 3.84Mcps TDD -- _DPCH ID_ IE] [7.68Mcps TDD -- _DPCH
ID 7.68Mcps_ IE].]
\- [TDD -- If the measurement was made on a particular HS-SICH, the DEDICATED
MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message shall include the ID of that HS-SICH
in the _HS-SICH ID_ IE.]
[FDD -- If the _Alternative Format Reporting Indicator_ IE is set to
"Alternative format is allowed" in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION
REQUEST message, the DRNC may include the _Extended Round Trip Time_ IE in the
DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.]
#### 8.3.11.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 21: Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure, Unsuccessful Operation
If the requested measurement cannot be initiated for one of the RL/RLS, the
DRNC shall send a DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message. The
message shall include the same _Measurement ID_ IE that was used in the
DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message and shall include the _Cause_
IE set to an appropriate value.
If the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message includes the _Partial
Reporting Indicator IE_ , the DRNS shall, if partial reporting is supported,
separate the unsuccessful measurement initiations from the successful
measurement initiations. For the successful measurement initiations on a RL or
an RLS, the DRNS shall include the _Successful RL Information_ IE or the
_Successful RL Set Information_ IE for the concerned RL or RLS if the R _eport
Characteristics_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message
was set to "On Demand". For the unsuccessful measurement initiations, the DRNS
shall include the _Individual_ _Cause_ IE set to an appropriate value if it
differs from the value of the _Cause_ IE.
Typical cause values are:
**Radio Network Layer Causes:**
Measurement not Supported For The Object;
Measurement Temporarily not Available.
**Miscellaneous Causes:**
Control Processing Overload;
HW Failure.
#### 8.3.11.4 Abnormal Conditions

initiated (by the Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure) for multiple
dedicated measurement objects, the DRNC may include dedicated measurement
values in the _Dedicated Measurement Value Information_ IE for multiple
objects in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message.
The _Measurement ID_ IE shall be set to the Measurement ID provided by the
SRNC when initiating the measurement with the Dedicated Measurement Initiation
procedure.
If the achieved measurement accuracy does not fulfil the given accuracy
requirement specified in TS 25.133 [23] and TS 25.123 [24] or the measurement
is temporarily not available in case Measurement Recovery Behavior is
supported, the Measurement not available shall be reported in the _Dedicated
Measurement Value Information_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message,
otherwise the DRNC shall include the _Dedicated Measurement Value_ IE within
the _Dedicated Measurement Value Information_ IE. If the DRNC was configured
to perform the Measurement Recovery Behavior, the DRNC shall indicate
Measurement Available to the SRNC when the achieved measurement accuracy again
fullfils the given accuracy requirement (see TS 25.133 [23] and TS 25.123
[24]) and include the _Measurement Recovery Report Indicator_ IE in the
DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT message if the requested measurement reporting
criteria are not met.
If the CFN Reporting Indicator when initiating the measurement with the
Dedicated Measurement Initiation procedure was set to "FN Reporting Required",
the DRNC shall include the _CFN_ IE in the DEDICATED MEASUREMENT REPORT
message. The reported CFN shall be the CFN at the time when the dedicated
measurement value was reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C

### 8.3.15 Downlink Power Control [FDD]
#### 8.3.15.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to balance the DL transmission powers of one
or more radio links for one UE.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE
Context.
The Downlink Power Control procedure may be initiated by the SRNC at any time
after establishing a Radio Link. If the SRNC has initiated in this DRNS the
deletion of the last Radio Link for this UE context, the Downlink Power
Control procedure shall not be initiated.
#### 8.3.15.2 Successful Operation
Figure 25: Downlink Power Control procedure, Successful Operation
The Downlink Power Control procedure is initiated by the SRNC sending a DL
POWER CONTROL REQUEST message to the DRNC.
The _Power Adjustment Type_ IE defines the characteristic of the power
adjustment.
If the value of the _Power Adjustment Type_ IE is "Common", the DRNS shall set
the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context set to "Common". As long
as the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context is set to "Common",
the DRNS shall perform the power adjustment (see below) for all existing and
future radio links for the UE Context and use a common DL reference power
level.
If the value of the _Power Adjustment Type_ IE is "Individual", the DRNS shall
set the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context set to "Individual".
The DRNS shall perform the power adjustment (see below) for all radio links
addressed in the message using the given DL Reference Power per RL. If the
Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context was set to "Common" before
this message was received, power balancing on all radio links not addressed by
the DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message shall remain to be executed in accordance
with the existing power balancing parameters which are now considered RL
individual parameters. Power balancing will not be started on future radio
links without a specific request.
If the value of the _Power Adjustment Type_ IE is "None", the DRNS shall set
the Power Balancing Adjustment Type of the UE Context set to "None" and the
DRNS shall suspend on going power adjustments for all radio links for the UE
Context.
If the _Inner Loop DL PC Status_ IE is present and set to "Active", the DRNS
shall activate inner loop DL power control for all radio links for the UE
Context. If the _Inner Loop DL PC Status_ IE is present and set to "Inactive",
the DRNS shall deactivate inner loop DL power control for all radio links for
the UE Context according to TS 25.214 [10].
**Power Adjustment**
The power balancing adjustment shall be superimposed on the inner loop power
control adjustment (see TS 25.214 [10]) if activated. The power balancing
adjustment shall be such that:
$\sum_{}^{}P_{\text{bal}} = (1 - r)(P_{\text{ref}} + P_{P - \text{CPICH}} -
P_{\text{init}})$with an accuracy of Â±0.5 dB
where the sum is performed over an adjustment period corresponding to a number
of frames equal to the value of the _Adjustment Period_ IE, _P~ref~_ is the
value of the _DL Reference Power_ IE, _P~P-CPICH~_ is the power used on the
primary CPICH, _P~init~_ is the code power of the last slot of the previous
adjustment period and _r_ is given by the _Adjustment Ratio_ IE. If the last
slot of the previous adjustment period is within a transmission gap due to
compressed mode, _P~init~_ shall be set to the same value as the code power of
the slot just before the transmission gap.
The adjustment within one adjustment period shall in any case be performed
with the constraints given by the _Max Adjustment Step_ IE and the DL TX power
range set by the DRNC.
The power adjustments shall be started at the first slot of a frame with CFN
modulo the value of _Adjustment Period_ IE equal to 0 and shall be repeated
for every adjustment period and shall be restarted at the first slot of a
frame with CFN=0, until a new DL POWER CONTROL REQUEST message is received or
the RL is deleted.
#### 8.3.15.3 Abnormal Conditions

### 8.3.16 Compressed Mode Command [FDD]
#### 8.3.16.1 General
The Compressed Mode Command procedure is used to activate or deactivate the
compressed mode in the DRNS for one UE-UTRAN connection. This procedure shall
use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE Context.
The Compressed Mode Command procedure shall not be initiated if a Prepared
Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1.
#### 8.3.16.2 Successful Operation
Figure 26: Compressed Mode Command procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated by the SRNC sending a COMPRESSED MODE COMMAND
message to the DRNC.
Upon receipt of the COMPRESSED MODE COMMAND message from the SRNC and at the
CFN indicated in the _CM Configuration Change CFN_ IE, the DRNS shall
deactivate all the ongoing Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences. From that
moment on all Transmission Gap Pattern Sequences included in _Transmission Gap
Pattern Sequence Status_ IE repetitions (if present) shall be started when the
indicated _TGCFN_ IE elapses. The _CM Configuration Change CFN_ IE in the
_Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE and _TGCFN_ IE for each sequence
refer to the next coming CFN with that value.
If the values of the _CM Configuration Change CFN_ IE and the _TGCFN_ IE are
equal, the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be started
immediately at the CFN with a value equal to the value received in the _CM
Configuration Change CFN_ IE.
If the _Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List_ IE is included, the concerned
Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to HS-DSCH serving cells
associated with _C-ID_ IE included in _Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List_ IE.
Otherwise the concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence shall be applied to
all the configured serving cells.
If the concerned UE Context is configured to use F-DPCH in the downlink, the
DRNS shall ignore, when activating the Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence(s),
the downlink compressed mode method information, if existing, for the
concerned Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence(s) in the Compressed Mode
Configuration.
#### 8.3.16.3 Abnormal Conditions
[FDD - If the _Affected HS-DSCH serving cell List_ IE is included in the
_Active Pattern Sequence Information_ IE, and theTransmission Gap Pattern
Sequence for affected HS-DSCH Serving Cells is activated on the HS-DSCH
Primary Serving Cell but not for all the other serving cells, the DRNS shall
initiate the Radio Link Failure procedure with the cause value "Invalid CM
Settings".]
### 8.3.17 Downlink Power Timeslot Control [TDD]
#### 8.3.17.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to provide the DRNS with updated DL Timeslot
ISCP values to use when deciding the DL TX Power for each timeslot.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE
Context.
The Downlink Power Timeslot Control procedure can be initiated by the SRNC at
any time after establishing a Radio Link. If the SRNC has initiated deletion
of the last Radio Link in this DRNS, the Downlink Power Timeslot Control
procedure shall not be initiated.
#### 8.3.17.2 Successful Operation
Figure 26A: Downlink Power Timeslot Control procedure, Successful Operation
The Downlink Power Timeslot Control procedure is initiated by the SRNC sending
a DL POWER TIMESLOT CONTROL REQUEST message to the DRNC.
Upon receipt of the DL POWER TIMESLOT CONTROL REQUEST message, the DRNS shall
use the included [3.84Mcps TDD and 7.68 Mcps TDD -- _DL Timeslot ISCP Info_
IE] [1.28Mcps TDD -- _DL Timeslot ISCP Info LCR_ IE] value when deciding the
DL TX Power for each timeslot as specified in TS 25.224 [22], i.e. it shall
reduce the DL TX power in those downlink timeslots of the radio link in which
the interference is low, and increase the DL TX power in those timeslots in
which the interference is high, while keeping the total downlink power in the
radio link unchanged.
If the _Primary CCPCH RSCP Delta_ IE is included, the DRNS shall assume that
the reported value for Primary CCPCH RSCP is in the negative range as per TS
25.123 [24], and the value is equal to the _Primary CCPCH RSCP Delta_ IE. If
the _Primary CCPCH RSCP Delta_ IE is not included and the _Primary CCPCH RSCP_
IE is included, the DRNS shall assume that the reported value is in the non-
negative range as per TS 25.123 [24], and the value is equal to the _Primary
CCPCH RSCP_ IE. The DRNS should use the indicated value for HS-DSCH scheduling
and transmit power adjustment.

-
### 8.3.18 Radio Link Pre-emption
#### 8.3.18.1 General
This procedure is started by the DRNS when resources need to be freed.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer connection for the UE Context
associated with the RL to be pre-empted.
The DRNS may initiate the Radio Link Pre-emption procedure at any time after
establishing a Radio Link.
#### 8.3.18.2 Successful Operation
Figure 26B: Radio Link Pre-emption procedure, Successful Operation
When DRNC detects that one or more Radio Link(s) should be pre-empted (see
Annex A), it shall send the RADIO LINK PREEMPTION REQUIRED INDICATION message
to the SRNC. If all Radio Links for a UE Context should be pre-empted, the _RL
Information_ IE shall not be included in the message. If one or several but
not all Radio Link(s) should be pre-empted for an UE Context, the Radio
Link(s) that should be pre-empted shall be indicated in the _RL Information_
IE. The Radio Link(s) that should be pre-empted, should be deleted by the
SRNC.
[FDD -- If only the E-DCH traffic on a Radio Link should be pre-empted, the
DRNC shall indicate the EDCH MAC-d flows that should be pre-empted by
including the _E-DCH MAC-d Flow Specific Information_ IE in the RADIO LINK
PREEMPTION REQUIRED INDICATION message.]
When only the HS-DSCH traffic on a Radio Link should be pre-empted, the DRNC
shall indicate the HS-DSCH MAC-d flow(s) that should be pre-empted by
including the _HS-DSCH MAC-d Flow Specific Information_ IE in the RADIO LINK
PREEMPTION REQUIRED INDICATION message.
#### 8.3.18.3 Abnormal Conditions

### 8.3.19 Radio Link Congestion
#### 8.3.19.1 General
This procedure is started by the DRNS when resource congestion is detected and
the rate of one or more DCHs, corresponding to one or more radio links, is
preferred to be limited in the UL and/or DL. This procedure is also used by
the DRNC to indicate to the SRNC any change of the UL/DL resource congestion
situation, affecting these radio links. This procedure shall use the
signalling bearer connection for the relevant UE Context.
The Radio Link Congestion procedure shall not be initiated if a Prepared
Reconfiguration exists, as defined in subclause 3.1.

When the DRNC detects the start of a UL/DL resource congestion situation and
prefers the rate of one or more DCHs for one or more Radio Link(s) to be
limited below the maximum rate currently configured in the UL/DL TFS, it shall
send the RADIO LINK CONGESTION INDICATION message to the SRNC. The DRNC shall
indicate the cause of the congestion in the _Congestion Cause_ IE and shall
indicate all the Radio Links for which the rate of a DCH needs to be reduced.
For each DCH within the RL with UL congestion, the DRNC shall indicate the
desired maximum UL data rate with the _Allowed UL Rate_ IE in the _Allowed
Rate Information_ IE. For each DCH within the RL with DL congestion, the DRNC

## 8.4 Common Transport Channel Procedures
### 8.4.1 Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation
#### 8.4.1.1 General
The Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation procedure is used by the
SRNC for the initialisation of the Common Transport Channel user plane towards
the DRNC and/or for the initialisation of the Common Transport Channel
resources in the DRNC to be used by a UE.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of the signalling bearer.
#### 8.4.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 27: Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation procedure,
Successful Operation
The SRNC initiates the procedure by sending the message COMMON TRANSPORT
CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message to the DRNC.
If the value of the _Transport Bearer Request Indicator_ IE is set to "Bearer
Requested", the DRNC shall store the received _Transport Bearer ID_ IE. The
DRNC may use the _Transport Layer Address_ and _Binding ID_ IEs included in
the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message received from the SRNC
when establishing a transport bearer for the common transport channel. In
addition, the DRNC shall include its own _Binding ID_ IE and _Transport Layer
Address_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE message.
If the _TNL QoS_ IE is included and if ALCAP is not used, the _TNL QoS_ IE may
be used by the DRNC to determine the transport bearer characteristics to apply
in the uplink between the DRNS and the SRNC for the related common transport
channels.
If the value of the _Transport Bearer Request Indicator_ IE is set to" Bearer
not Requested"_,_ the DRNC shall use the transport bearer indicated by the
_Transport Bearer ID_ IE.
If the _C-ID_ IE is included in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST
message, the DRNC shall allocate a C-RNTI for the indicated cell and include
the _C-RNTI_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE message.
If the _C-ID_ IE is included in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST
message, the DRNC shall include the _FACH Info for UE Selected S-CCPCH_ IE
valid for the cell indicated by the _C-ID_ IE and the corresponding _C-ID_ IE
in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE message. If the _C-ID_ IE
is not included in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message, the
DRNC shall include the _FACH Info for UE Selected S-CCPCH_ IE valid for the
cell where the UE is located and the corresponding _C-ID_ IE. The DRNC shall
include the _FACH Scheduling Priority_ IE and _FACH Initial Window Size_ IE in
the _FACH Flow Control Information_ IE of the _FACH Info for UE Selected
S-CCPCH_ IE for each priority class that the DRNC has determined shall be
used. The DRNC may include several _MAC-c/sh SDU Length_ IEs for each priority
class.
If the DRNS has any RACH and/or FACH [FDD -- and/or HS-DSCH] [1.28Mcps TDD --
and/or HS-DSCH] resources previously allocated for the UE in another cell than
the cell in which resources are currently being allocated, the DRNS shall
release the previously allocated RACH and/or FACH resources [FDD -- and/or HS-
DSCH] [1.28Mcps TDD -- and/or HS-DSCH].
If the DRNS has successfully reserved the required resources, the DRNC shall
respond to the SRNC with the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE
message.
If the _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE is present in the COMMON TRANSPORT
CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message, the DRNS shall store the information for
the considered UE Context for the lifetime of the UE Context.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message includes a _C-ID_ IE
corresponding to a cell reserved for operator use and the Permanent NAS UE
Identity is available in the DRNC for the considered UE Context, the DRNC
shall use this information to determine whether it can reserve resources on a
common transport channel in this cell or not.
If the _MBMS Bearer Service List_ IE is included in the COMMON TRANSPORT
CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message, the DRNC shall, if supported, perform the
UE Linking as specified in TS 25.346 [50], section 5.1.6. If an MBMS session
for some MBMS bearer services contained in the UE Link is ongoing in the cell
identified by the _C-ID_ IE, the DRNC shall include in the _Active MBMS Bearer
Service List_ IE the _Transmission Mode_ IE for each of these active MBMS
bearer services in the COMMON TRANPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE message.
[FDD -- If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message includes an
_Enhanced FACH Support Indicator_ IE, the DRNC may include the _Enhanced FACH
Information Response_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE
message. If a HS-DSCH RNTI was not previously allocated to the UE or a new HS-
DSCH RNTI is allocated to the UE, the DRNC shall include the _HS-DSCH-RNTI_ IE
in the _Enhanced FACH Information Response_ IE. And if Enhanced PCH operation
is activated in the cell indicated by the _C-ID_ IE, the DRNC shall include
the _Priority Queue Information for Enhanced PCH_ IE in the _Enhanced FACH
Information Response_ IE.]
[1.28Mcps TDD -- If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message
includes an _Enhanced FACH Support Indicator_ IE, the DRNC may include the
_Enhanced FACH Information Response_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL
RESOURCES RESPONSE message. If a HS-DSCH RNTI was not previously allocated to
the UE or a new HS-DSCH RNTI is allocated to the UE, the DRNC shall include
the _HS-DSCH-RNTI_ IE in the _Enhanced FACH Information Response_ IE. And if
Enhanced PCH operation is activated in the cell indicated by the _C-ID_ IE,
the DRNC shall include the _Priority Queue Information for Enhanced PCH_ IE in
the _Enhanced FACH Information Response_ IE.]
[FDD -- If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message includes an
_Common E-DCH Support Indicator_ IE, the DRNC may include the _Common E-DCH
MAC-d Flow Specific Information_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES
RESPONSE message. If the E-DCH MAC-d Flow Multiplexing List for a Common E-DCH
MAC-d Flow is configured in DRNC, the DRNC shall include the _E-DCH MAC-d Flow
Multiplexing List_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE
message. If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message includes
the _C-ID_ IE and the _Common E-DCH Support Indicator_ IE, the DRNC may
include the _E-RNTI_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE
message.]
[1.28Mcps TDD -- If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message
includes a _Enhanced FACH Support Indicator_ IE, the DRNC may include the
_Common E-DCH MAC-d Flow Specific Information LCR_ IE in the COMMON TRANSPORT
CHANNEL RESOURCES RESPONSE message.]
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message includes an _HS-DSCH
physical layer category_ IE, the DRNC may store the information for the
considered UE Context for the lifetime of the UE Context.
[FDD -- If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURES REQUEST message includes an
_UE with enhanced HS-SCCH support indicator_ IE, the DRNC may store the
information for the considered UE Context for the lifetime of the UE context.]
#### 8.4.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 28: Common Transport Channel Resources Initialisation procedure,
Unsuccessful Operation
If the _Transport Bearer Request Indicator_ IE is set to "Bearer Requested"
and the DRNC is not able to provide a Transport Bearer, the DRNC shall reject
the procedure and respond to the SRNC with the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL
RESOURCES FAILURE message, including the reason for the failure in the _Cause_
IE.
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message contains a _C-ID_ IE
corresponding to a cell reserved for operator use and the Permanent NAS UE
Identity is not available for the considered UE Context, the DRNC shall reject
the procedure and send the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES FAILURE message,
including the reason for the failure in the _Cause_ IE.
Typical cause values are:
**Radio Network Layer Causes:**
\- Common Transport Channel Type not Supported;
\- Cell reserved for operator use.
**Transport Layer Causes:**
\- Transport Resource Unavailable.
#### 8.4.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST message contains the
_Transport Layer Address_ IE or the _Binding ID_ IE, and not both are present
for a transport channel intended to be established, the DRNC shall reject the
procedure using the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES FAILURE message.
If ALCAP is not used, if the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES REQUEST
message contains the _Transport Bearer Request Indicator_ IE set to "Bearer
Requested" but does not contain the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and the
_Binding ID_ IE, the DRNC shall reject the procedure using the COMMON
TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES FAILURE message.
### 8.4.2 Common Transport Channel Resources Release
#### 8.4.2.1 General
This procedure is used by the SRNC to request release of Common Transport
Channel Resources for a given UE in the DRNS. The SRNC uses this procedure
either to release the UE Context from the DRNC (and thus both the D-RNTI and
the C-RNTI) or to release only the C-RNTI.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of the signalling bearer.
#### 8.4.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 29: Common Transport Channel Resources Release procedure, Successful
Operation
The SRNC initiates the Common Transport Channel Resources Release procedure by
sending the COMMON TRANSPORT CHANNEL RESOURCES RELEASE REQUEST message to the
DRNC. Upon receipt of the message the DRNC shall release the UE Context
identified by the D-RNTI and all its related RACH and/or FACH resources,
unless the UE is using dedicated resources (DCH, [TDD -- USCH and/or DSCH]) in
the DRNS in which case the DRNC shall release only the C-RNTI and all its
related RACH and/or FACH [FDD -- and/or HS-DSCH] [1.28Mcps TDD -- and/or HS-
DSCH] resources allocated for the UE.

## 8.5 Global Procedures
### 8.5.1 Error Indication
#### 8.5.1.1 General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected
errors in a received message, provided they cannot be reported by an
appropriate response message.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer mode specified below.
#### 8.5.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 30: Error Indication procedure, Successful Operation
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication
procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving
node. This message shall use the same mode of the signalling bearer and the
same signalling bearer connection (if connection oriented) as the message that
triggers the procedure.
When the ERROR INDICATION message is sent from a DRNC to an SRNC using
connectionless mode of the signalling bearer, the _S-RNTI_ IE shall be
included in the message if the UE Context addressed by the _D-RNTI_ IE which
was received in the message triggering the Error Indication procedure exists.
When the ERROR INDICATION message is sent from an SRNC to a DRNC using
connectionless mode of the signalling bearer, the _D-RNTI_ IE shall be
included in the message if available.
When a message using connectionless mode of the signalling bearer is received
in the DRNC and there is no UE Context in the DRNC as indicated by the _D-
RNTI_ IE, the DRNC shall include the D-RNTI from the received message in the
_D-RNTI_ IE and set the _Cause_ IE to "Unknown RNTI" in the ERROR INDICATION
message, unless another handling is specified in the procedure text for the
affected procedure.
When a message using connectionless mode of the signalling bearer is received
in the SRNC and there is no UE in the SRNC as indicated by the _S-RNTI_ IE,
the SRNC shall include the S-RNTI from the received message in the _S-RNTI_ IE
and set the _Cause_ IE to "Unknown RNTI" in the ERROR INDICATION message,
unless another handling is specified in the procedure text for the affected
procedure.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall include either the _Cause_ IE, or the
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, or both the _Cause_ IE and the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE to indicate the reason for the error indication.
Typical cause values for the ERROR INDICATION message are:
**Protocol Causes:**
\- Transfer Syntax Error;
\- Abstract Syntax Error (Reject);
\- Abstract Syntax Error (Ignore and Notify);
\- Message not Compatible with Receiver State;
\- Unspecified.

### 8.5.2 Common Measurement Initiation
#### 8.5.2.1 General
This procedure is used by an RNC to request the initiation of measurements of
common resources to another RNC. The requesting RNC is referred to as RNC~1~
and the RNC to which the request is sent is referred to as RNC~2~.
This procedure uses the signalling bearer connection for the relevant Distant
RNC Context.
#### 8.5.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 30A: Common Measurement Initiation procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with a COMMON MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message sent from the RNC~1~ to the RNC~2~.
Upon receipt, the RNC~2~ shall initiate the requested measurement according to
the parameters given in the request.
Unless specified below, the meaning of the parameters are given in other
specifications.
[TDD -- If the [3.84 Mcps TDD and 7.68 Mcps TDD -- _Time Slot_ IE] [1.28 Mcps
-- _Time Slot LCR_ IE] is present in the COMMON MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message, the measurement request shall apply to the requested time slot
individually.]
**Common measurement type**
If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "SFN-SFN Observed Time
Difference", then:
\- The RNC~2~ shall initiate the SFN-SFN Observed Time Difference measurements
between the reference cell identified by the _Reference Cell Identifier_ IE
and the neighbouring cells identified by the _UTRAN Cell Identifier_ IE (_UC-
ID_) in the _Neighbouring Cell Measurement Information_ IE.
\- [3.84 Mcps TDD -- The RNC~2~ shall perform the measurement using the time
slot specified in the _Time Slot_ IE in the _Neighbouring TDD Cell Measurement
Information_ IE and using the midamble shift and burst type specified in the
_Midamble Shift And Burst Type_ IE in the _Neighbouring TDD Cell Measurement
Information_ IE. If _Time Slot_ IE and _Midamble Shift And Burst Type_ IE are
not available in the _Neighbouring TDD Cell Measurement Information_ IE, the
RNC~2~ may use any appropriate time slots, midamble shifts and burst types to
make the measurement.]
\- [7.68 Mcps TDD -- The RNC~2~ shall perform the measurement using the time
slot specified in the _Time Slot_ IE in the _Neighbouring TDD Cell Measurement
Information 7.68 Mcps_ IE and using the midamble shift and burst type
specified in the _Midamble Shift And Burst Type 7.68 Mcps_ IE in the
_Neighbouring TDD Cell Measurement Information 7.68 Mcps_ IE. If _Time Slot_
IE and _Midamble Shift And Burst Type 7.68 Mcps_ IE are not available in the
_Neighbouring TDD Cell Measurement Information 7.68 Mcps_ IE, the RNC~2~ may
use any appropriate time slots, midamble shifts and burst types to make the
measurement.]
If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "load", the RNC~2~ shall
initiate measurements of uplink and downlink load on the measured object
identified by the _Reference Cell Identifier_ IE. If either uplink or downlink
load satisfies the requested report characteristics, the RNC~2~ shall report
the result of both uplink and downlink measurements.
If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "UTRAN GPS Timing of Cell Frames
for UE Positioning", "UTRAN GANSS Timing of Cell Frames for UE Positioning",
"transmitted carrier power", "received total wide band power", or "UL timeslot
ISCP" the RNC~2~ shall initiate measurements on the measured object identified
by the _Reference Cell Identifier_ IE.
If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "UTRAN GANSS Timing of Cell
Frames for UE Positioning", then the RNC~2~ shall initiate the UTRAN GANSS
Timing of Cell Frames measurements using the GNSS system time identified by
_GANSS Time ID_ IE included in the COMMON MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message.
\- If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "UTRAN GANSS Timing of Cell
Frames for UE Positioning" and the _GANSS Time ID_ IE is not included in the
COMMON MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message, the RNC~2~ shall assume that
the corresponding GANSS time is "Galileo" system time.
If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "RT load", the RNC~2~ shall
initiate measurements of uplink and downlink estimated share of RT (Real Time)
traffic of the load of the measured object. If either uplink or downlink RT
load satisfies the requested report characteristics, the RNC~2~ shall report
the result of both uplink and downlink measurements.
If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "NRT load Information", the
RNC~2~ shall initiate measurements of uplink and downlink NRT (Non Real Time)
load situation on the measured object. If either uplink or downlink NRT load
satisfies the requested report characteristics, the RNC~2~ shall report the
result of both uplink and downlink measurements.
**Report characteristics**
The _Report Characteristics_ IE indicates how the reporting of the measurement
shall be performed. See also Annex B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "On Demand" and if the _SFN_ IE
is not provided, the RNC~2~ shall report the result of the requested
measurement immediately in the COMMON MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.
If the _SFN_ IE is provided, it indicates the frame for which the measurement
value shall be provided. The provided measurement value shall be the one
reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [26]). Furthermore, if the _SFN_ IE is present and if the
_Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "SFN-SFN Observed Time Difference ",
then the _SFN_ IE relates to the Radio Frames of the Reference Cell identified
by the _Reference Cell Identifier_ IE.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Periodic" and if the _SFN_ IE is
not provided, the RNC~2~ shall immediately and periodically initiate a Common
Measurement Reporting procedure for this measurement, with a frequency as
specified by the _Report Periodicity_ IE. If the _SFN_ IE is provided, the
RNC~2~ shall initiate a Common Measurement Reporting procedure for this
measurement at the SFN indicated in the _SFN_ IE, and shall repeat this
initiation periodically thereafter with a frequency as specified by the
_Report Periodicity_ IE. The provided measurement value shall be the one
reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to as point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [26]). Furthermore, if the _SFN_ IE is present and if the
_Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "SFN-SFN Observed Time Difference ",
then the _SFN_ IE relates to the Radio Frames of the Reference Cell identified
by the _Reference Cell Identifier_ IE.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event A", the RNC~2~ shall
initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity
rises above the requested threshold, as specified by the _Measurement
Threshold_ IE, and then stays above the threshold for the requested hysteresis
time, as specified by the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE. If the
_Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the RNC~2~ shall use the
value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event B", the RNC~2~ shall
initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity
falls below the requested threshold, as specified by the _Measurement
Threshold_ IE, and then stays below the threshold for the requested hysteresis
time, as specified by the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE. If the
_Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the RNC~2~ shall use the
value zero for the hysteresis time.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event C", the RNC~2~ shall
initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity
rises more than the requested threshold specified by the _Measurement
Increase/Decrease Threshold_ IE, and only when this rise occurs within the
requested rising time specified by the _Measurement Change Time_ IE. After
reporting this type of event, the RNC~2~ shall not initiate the next C event
reporting for the same measurement during the subsequent time specified by the
_Measurement Change Time_ IE.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event D", the RNC~2~ shall
initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity
falls more than the requested threshold specified by the _Measurement
Increase/Decrease Threshold_ IE, and only when this fall occurs within the
requested falling time specified by the _Measurement Change Time_ IE. After
reporting this type of event,, the RNC~2~ shall not initiate the next D event
reporting for the same measurement during the subsequent time specified by the
_Measurement Change Time_ IE.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event E", the RNC~2~shall
initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity
rises above the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE and stays above the threshold for
the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE (Report A). When the conditions for
Report A are met and if the _Report Periodicity_ IE is provided, the RNC~2~
shall initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure periodically with
the requested report frequency specified by the _Report Periodicity_ IE. If
the conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity falls below
the _Measurement Threshold 2_ IE and stays below the threshold for the
_Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE, the RNC~2~ shall initiate the Common
Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) and shall terminate any
corresponding periodic reporting. If the _Measurement Threshold 2_ IE is not
present, the RNC~2~ shall use the value of the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE
instead. If the _Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the RNC~2~
shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event F", the RNC~2~ shall
initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure when the measured entity
falls below the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE and stays below the threshold for
the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE (Report A). When the conditions for
Report A are met and if the _Report Periodicity_ IE is provided, the RNC~2~
shall initiate the Measurement Reporting procedure periodically with the
requested report frequency specified by the _Report Periodicity_ IE. If the
conditions for Report A have been met and the measured entity rises above the
_Measurement Threshold 2_ IE and stays above the threshold for the
_Measurement Hysteresis Time_ IE, the RNC~2~ shall initiate the Common
Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) and shall terminate any
corresponding periodic reporting. If the _Measurement Threshold 2_ IE is not
present, the RNC~2~ shall use the value of the _Measurement Threshold 1_ IE
instead. If the _Measurement Hysteresis_ _Time_ IE is not included, the RNC~2~
shall use the value zero as hysteresis times for both Report A and Report B.
[1.28Mcps TDD-If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event H" (figure
B.7), the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated when the
measurement value of measured entity rises above the _Measurement Threshold 1_
and stays above the threshold for the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ (T~1~ in
figure B.7).] The measurement value of measured entity in Report A substitutes
the _Measurement Base value_ for the consequent measurement reporting.
When the Report A conditions has been met and the measurement value of
measured entity rises above or falls below the _Measurement Base Value_ by
_Measurement Fluctuation Range_ (H~1~ in figure B.7), and stays there for the
_Measurement Hysteresis Time_ (T~h~ in figure B.7) counting from the beginning
of every _Report Periodicity_ , the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B
or Report C) is initiated. The the measurement value of measured entity in
(Report B or Report C) substitutes the _Measurement Base value_ for the
consequent measurement reporting.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measurement value of
measured entity falls below the _Measurement Threshold 2_ and stays there for
the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ (T~h~ in figure B.7), the Measurement
Reporting procedure (Report D) is initiated and the reporting is terminated.]
If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "On Modification" and if the
_SFN_ IE is not provided, the RNC~2~ shall report the result of the requested
measurement immediately. If the _SFN_ IE is provided, it indicates the frame
for which the first measurement value shall be provided. The provided
measurement value shall be the one reported by the layer 3 filter, referred to
as point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]). Furthermore, if the
_SFN_ IE is present and if the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "SFN-SFN
Observed Time Difference", then the _SFN_ IE relates to the Radio Frames of
the Reference Cell identified by the _Reference Cell Identifier_ IE. Following
the first measurement report, the RNC~2~ shall initiate the Common Measurement
Reporting procedure in accordance to the following conditions:
> 1\. If the _Common Measurement Type_ IE is set to "UTRAN GPS Timing of Cell
> Frames for UE Positioning":
\- If the _T~UTRAN-GPS~ Change Limit_ IE is included in the _T~UTRAN-GPS~
Measurement Threshold Information_ IE, the RNC~2~ shall calculate the change
of T~UTRAN-GPS~ value (F~n~) each time a new measurement result is received
after point C in the measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]). The RNC~2~ shall
initiate the Common Measurement Reporting procedure and set n equal to zero
when the absolute value of F~n~ rises above the threshold indicated by the
_T~UTRAN-GPS~ Change Limit_ IE. The change of T~UTRAN-GPS~ value (F~n~) is
calculated according to the following:
F~n~=0 for n=0
F~n~ = (M~n~ -- M~n-1~) mod 37158912000000 -- ((SFN~n~ -- SFN~n-1~) mod 4096)
*10*3.84*10\^3*16 + F~n-1~ for n>0
F~n~ is the change of the T~UTRAN-GPS~ value expressed in unit [1/16 chip]
when n measurement results have been received after the first Common
Measurement Reporting at initiation or after the last event was triggered.
M~n~ is the latest measurement result received after point C in the
measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]), measured at SFN~n~.
M~n-1~ is the previous measurement result received after point C in the
measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]), measured at SFN~n-1.~
M~1~ is the first measurement result received after point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [26]), after first Common Measurement Reporting at initiation
or after the last event was triggered.
M~0~ is equal to the value reported in the first Common Measurement Reporting
at initiation or in the Common Measurement Reporting when the event was
triggered.
\- If the _Predicted T~UTRAN-GPS~ Deviation Limit_ IE is included in the
_T~UTRAN-GPS~ Measurement Threshold Information_ IE, the RNC~2~ shall update
the P~n~ and F each time a new measurement result is received after point C in
the measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]). The RNC~2~ shall initiate the Common
Measurement Reporting procedure and set n equal to zero when F~n~ rises above
the threshold indicated by the _Predicted T~UTRAN-GPS~ Deviation Limit_ IE.
The P~n~ and F~n~ are calculated according to the following:
P~n~=b for n=0
P~n~ = ((a/16) * ((SFN~n~ -- SFN~n-1~) mod 4096) /100 +((SFN~n~ -- SFN~n-1~)
mod 4096)*10*3.84*10\^3*16 + P~n-1~ ) mod 37158912000000 for n>0
F~n~ = min((M~n~ -- P~n~) mod 37158912000000, (P~n~ -- M~n~) mod
37158912000000) for n>0
P~n~ is the predicted T~UTRAN-GPS~ value when n measurement results have been
received after the first Common Measurement Reporting at initiation or after
the last event was triggered.
A is the last reported T~UTRAN-GPS~ Drift Rate value.
B is the last reported T~UTRAN-GPS~ value.
F~n~ is the deviation of the last measurement result from the predicted
T~UTRAN-GPS~ value (P~n~ ) when n measurements have been received after the
first Common Measurement Reporting at initiation or after the last event was
triggered.
M~n~ is the latest measurement result received after point C in the
measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]), measured at SFN~n~ .
M~1~ is the first measurement result received after point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [26]), after first Common Measurement Reporting at initiation
or after the last event was triggered.

[FDD -- F~n~ = (M~n~ -- a) mod 614400 for n>0]
[TDD -- F~n~ = (M~n~ -- a) mod 40960 for n>0]
F~n~ is the change of the SFN-SFN value expressed in unit [1/16 chip] when n
measurement results have been received after the first Common Measurement
Reporting at initiation or after the last event was triggered.
A is the last reported SFN-SFN.
M~n~ is the latest measurement result received after point C in the
measurement model (TS 25.302 [26]), measured at SFN~n~.
M~1~ is the first measurement result received after point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [26]), after the first Common Measurement Reporting at
initiation or after the last event was triggered.

Measurement Reporting procedure in order to report the particular SFN-SFN
measurement which has triggered the event and set n equal to zero when F~n~

M~1~ is the first measurement result received after point C in the measurement
model (TS 25.302 [26]), after first Common Measurement Reporting at initiation
or after the last event was triggered.
The SFN-SFN Drift Rate is determined by the RNS~2~ in an implementation-
dependent way after point B (see model of physical layer measurements in (TS
25.302 [26])).

when the absolute value of F~n~ rises above the threshold indicated by the
_T~UTRAN-GANSS~ Change Limit_ IE. The change of T~UTRAN-GANSS~ value (F~n~) is
calculated according to the following:

according to GANSS time. The specified UTRAN event is the beginning of a
particular frame (identified through its SFN) in the first detected path (in
time) of the cell j CPICH, where cell j is a cell chosen by the UE. The
reference point for T~UE-GANSSj~ shall be the antenna connector of the UE.

Measurement Reporting procedure and set n equal to zero when F~n~ rises above
the threshold indicated by the _Predicted T~UTRAN-GANSS~ Deviation Limit_ IE.

GANSS measurement model, measured at SFN~n.~
GAM~1~ is the first GANSS measurement result received after point C in the
GANSS measurement model, after the first Common Measurement Reporting at

If the _Report Characteristics_ IE is not set to "On Demand", the RNC~2~ is
required to perform reporting for a common measurement object, in accordance
with the conditions provided in the COMMON MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message, as long as the object exists. If no common measurement object(s) for
which a measurement is defined exists any more, the RNC~2~ shall terminate the
measurement locally without reporting this to RNC~1~.
If at the start of the measurement, the reporting criteria are fulfilled for

_A_ = Â½^(k/2)^ -, where k is the parameter received in the _Measurement Filter
Coefficient_ IE. If the _Measurement Filter Coefficient_ IE is not present,
_a_ shall be set to 1 (no filtering).
In order to initialise the averaging filter, _F~0~_ is set to _M~1~_ when the
first measurement result from the physical layer measurement is received.

#### 8.5.10.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another
Reset procedure) on same Iur interface related to a context indicated
explicitly or implicitly in the message shall be aborted.
### 8.5.11 Direct Information Transfer
#### 8.5.11.1 General
This procedure is used by an RNC to transfer information to another RNC
spontaneously.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of signalling bearer.
#### 8.5.11.2 Successful Operation
Figure 30L: Direct Information Transfer procedure, Successful Operation
The procedure is initiated with an DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message sent
from RNC~1~ to RNC~2~.
If the initiating RNC of this procedure is RNC~1~, RNC~1~ shall provide
appropriate information in the _Provided Information_ IE.
**MBMS Channel Type Indication:**
At the start time of a session for an MBMS bearer service, if the RNC~1~ is in
the DRNC role for some Ues whose UE Link contains the concerned MBMS bearer
service and whose SRNC is RNC~2~ and if the channel type is determined by the
RNC~1~ for certain cells in the DRNS, the procedure shall be initiated by the
RNC~1~ to the RNC~2~. In this case, the RNC~1~ shall include in the _Provided
Information_ IE the _Channel Type Information_ IE in the DIRECT INFORMATION
TRANSFER message.
During a session of an MBMS bearer service, if the RNC~1~ is in the DRNC role
for some Ues whose UE Link contains the concerned MBMS bearer service and
whose SRNC is RNC~2~, then the RNC~1~ may initiate this procedure to indicate
channel type change for the MBMS bearer service in certain cells. In this
case, the RNC~1~ shall include in the _Provided Information_ IE the _Channel
Type Information_ IE in the DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message.
The RNC~1~ shall include the available information within the _PTM Cell List_
IE, the _PTP Cell List_ IE and/or the _Not Provided Cell List_ IE in the
_Channel Type Information_ IE.
**MBMS Preferred Frequency Layer Indication:**
At the start time of a session for an MBMS bearer service, if the RNC~1~ is in
the DRNC role for at least one CELL_DCH UE whose UE Link contains the
concerned MBMS bearer service and whose SRNC is RNC~2~ and if the preferred
frequency layer is determined by the RNC~1~ for certain cells that host at
least one of these CELL_DCH Ues whose SRNC is RNC~2~, the procedure shall be
initiated by the RNC~1~ to the RNC~2~. In this case, the RNC~1~ shall include
in the _Provided Information_ IE the _Preferred Frequency Layer Information_
IE in the DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message.
If some of the cells controlled by RNC~1~ that host at least one of these
CELL_DCH Ues whose SRNC is RNC~2~ are configured with different preferred
frequencies, the _Additional Preferred Frequency_ IE as well as _Default
Preferred Frequency_ IE shall be included in the _Preferred Frequency Layer
Information_ IE. In this case, for each preferred frequency different from the
_Default Preferred Frequency_ IE, one _Additional Preferred Frequency_ IE
shall be included containing at least one _Corresponding Cells_ IE.
**ANR Report Indication:**
The message contains _ANR Report Indication_ IE if the initiating RNC (RNC~1~)
has decided to forward a logged ANR report received over Uu to RNC~2~. On
reception of the _ANR Report Indication_ IE, RNC2 may use the information to
configure neighbour relations.
### 8.5.12 Information Transfer Control
#### 8.5.12.1 General
This procedure is used by an RNC to control transfer of information (e.g. log
information related to ANR) from an RNC to any other RNC. This procedure is
initiated by an RNC to suspend or resume transfer of information.
This procedure shall use the connectionless mode of signalling bearer.
#### 8.5.12.2 Successful Operation
Figure 30M: Information Transfer Control procedure, Successful Operation
The RNC~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the INFORMATION TRANSFER CONTROL
REQUEST message to the RNC~2~.
The _Control Type_ IE within the INFORMATION TRANSFER CONTROL REQUEST message
shall be used to either suspend or to resume (respectively indicated by
_Suspension_ IE or _Resume_ IE in _Control Type_ IE) the transfer of
information for the specified scope of objects indicated by _Controlled_
_Object Scope_ IE.
If the control of information transfer is intended for individual cells, those
cells shall be indicated in the _UMTS Cell Information_ IE within the
_Controlled_ _Object Scope_ IE. If the _UMTS Cell Information_ IE is not
included, the procedure is intended for the whole entity indicated in _RNC-ID_
IE or _Extended RNC-ID_ IE. In shared network configurations, PLMN identities
shall be indicated with _Multiple PLMN List_ IE.

## 8.6 MBMS Procedures
### 8.6.1 MBMS Attach
#### 8.6.1.1 General
The MBMS Attach procedure is used by the SRNC to either create a UE Link/URA
Link in the DRNC or inform the DRNC about any addition of one or several MBMS
bearer services in an already stored UE Link or URA Link.
This procedure shall use the signalling bearer mode specified below.
#### 8.6.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 31: MBMS Attach procedure, Successful Operation
The SRNC initiates the procedure by sending the message MBMS ATTACH COMMAND
message to the DRNC.
When the UE is utilising one or more radio links in the DRNC, the message
shall be sent using the connection oriented service of the signalling bearer
and no further identification of the UE Context in the DRNC is required. If
the UE is not utilising any radio link, the message shall be sent using the
connectionless service of the signalling bearer.
If no _UE State_ IE is included in the message or the _UE State_ IE is set to
"CELL_FACH/CELL_PCH", the DRNC shall perform the UE Linking as specified in TS
25.346 [50], section 5.1.6.
If the _UE State_ IE is set to "URA_PCH", the DRNC shall perform the URA
Linking as specified in TS 25.346 [50], section 5.1.10.
#### 8.6.1.3 Abnormal Conditions

# 9 Elements for RNSAP Communication
## 9.1 Message Functional Definition and Content
### 9.1.1 General
This subclause defines the structure of the messages required for the RNSAP
protocol in tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in
subclause 9.3. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format in
subclause 9.1 and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence,
except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional IEs,
in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
NOTE: The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified
in TR 25.921 [28].
### 9.1.2 Message Contents
#### 9.1.2.1 Presence
An information element can be of the following _types_ :
* * *
M IEs marked as Mandatory (M) shall always be included in the message. O IEs
marked as Optional (O) may or may not be included in the message. C IEs marked
as Conditional I shall be included in a message only if the condition is
satisfied. Otherwise the IE shall not be included.
* * *
In the case of an Information Element group, the group is preceded by a name
for the info group (in bold). It is also indicated how many times a group may
be repeated in the message and whether the group is conditional. Each group
may be also repeated within one message. The presence field of the Information
Elements inside one group defines if the Information Element is mandatory,
optional or conditional if the group is present.
#### 9.1.2.2 Criticality
Each information element or Group of information elements may have criticality
information applied to it.\ Following cases are possible:
* * *
\-- No criticality information is applied explicitly. YES Criticality
information is applied. 'YES' is usable only for non-repeatable information
elements. GLOBAL The information element and all its repetitions together have
one common criticality information. 'GLOBAL' is usable only for repeatable
information elements. EACH Each repetition of the information element has its
own criticality information. It is not allowed to assign different criticality
values to the repetitions. 'EACH' is usable only for repeatable information
elements.
* * *
#### 9.1.2.3 Range
The Range column indicates the allowed number of copies of repetitive IEs/IE
groups.
#### 9.1.2.4 Assigned Criticality
This column provides the actual criticality information as defined in
subclause 10.3.2, if applicable.

## 9.2 Information Element Functional Definition and Contents
### 9.2.0 General
Subclause 9.2 presents the RNSAP IE definitions in tabular format. The
corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is
a contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1
definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of
conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular
format shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by
bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description
of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards
to the ordering of bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;
### 9.2.1 Common Parameters
This subclause contains parameters that are common to FDD and TDD.
#### 9.2.1.1 Allocation/Retention Priority
This parameter indicates the priority level in the allocation and retention of
transport channel resources in DRNS. DRNS may use the Allocation/Retention
priority information of the transport channels composing the RL to prioritise
requests for RL Setup/addition and reconfiguration. In similar way, DRNS may
use the allocation/Retention priority information of the transport channels
composing the RL to prioritise which RL shall be set to failure, in case
prioritisation is possible. See Annex A.

#### 9.2.1.2 Allowed Queuing Time
This parameter specifies the maximum queuing time that is allowed in the DRNS
until the DRNS must start to execute the request.
* * *
IE/Group Name Presence Range IE Type and Reference Semantics Description
Allowed Queuing Time INTEGER(1..60) Unit: Seconds.
* * *
#### 9.2.1.2A Allowed Rate Information
The _Allowed Rate Information_ IE indicates the TFI corresponding to the
highest allowed bit rate for the uplink and/or the downlink of a DCH. The SRNC
is allowed to use any rate being lower than or equal to the rate corresponding
to the indicated TFI.

#### 9.2.2.123 Cell Capability Container Extension FDD
The _Cell Capability Container Extension FDD_ IE is an extension to the _Cell
Capability Container FDD_ IE and indicates the cell capability in the same way
as _Cell Capability Container Extension FDD_ IE.
The cell capability of multi-cell related functions may depend on that the
cell is multi-cell capable (adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier) or Dual Band
capable. Such support indicators in this _Cell Capability Container Extension
FDD_ IE shall be ignored by the SRNC if the cell does not have the required
support indicated in the _Cell Capability Container FDD_ IE: Multi Cell
Support Indicator = \"1\" and/or Dual Band Support Indicator = \"1\". Support
indicators that depend on multi-cell (adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier)
support are indicated in the table below with /Adjacent-carrier/. Support
indicators that depend on Dual Band support are indicated in the table below
with /Dual-band/. Support indicators that depend on that the cell supports one
or both of multi-cell (adjacent and/or non-adjacent carrier) and Dual Band are
indicated in the table below with /Multi-cell/. The marked support indicators
indicate the support regardless of the supported multi-cell type in a
multicell configuration: supported multi-cell type is - both serving HS-DSCH
and secondary serving HS-DSCH, - secondary serving HS-DSCH or - serving HS-
DSCH.

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.3.0 General
RNSAP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.680 [18] and ITU-T Rec.
X.681 [19].
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of RNSAP protocol with ASN.1. In
case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and
the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence,
except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional
elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of RNSAP messages.
RNSAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct a RNSAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules:
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory".
An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value
"optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity
specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1
definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part
defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second
part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own.
For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one
kind of list elements.
> NOTE: In the above "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID.
> If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the
> different occurrences have different IE IDs.
If a RNSAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
### 9.3.1 Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be
part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor
inter-operability.
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.

## 9.4 Message Transfer Syntax
RNSAP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned
Variant as transfer syntax as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [20].
## 9.5 Timers
T ~Preempt~
\- Specifies the maximum time that a DRNS may wait for pre-emption of
resources for establishment or reconfiguration of Radio Links.
T~RELOCprep~
\- Specifies the maximum time for the Enhanced Relocation procedure in the
SRNC.
# 10 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
## 10.1 General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
1\. Transfer Syntax Error;
2\. Abstract Syntax Error;
3\. Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node.
Figure 34: Protocol Errors in RNSAP
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in
the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be
included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be
included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is
done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in
subclause 4.1.
## 10.2 Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the
received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the
process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver
should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for
the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
\- Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. E.g.: If an IE
has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be
received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error;
\- Violation in list element constraints. E.g.: If a list is defined as
containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case
will be handled as a transfer syntax error;
\- Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message);
\- Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
## 10.3 Abstract Syntax Error
### 10.3.1 General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional RNSAP entity:
1\. Receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE id);
2 Receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g.: ASN.1
definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10 (values 11 to 15 are
undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract
syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the
message);
3 Does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence of
the concerned object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the
received message;
4 Receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in
wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5 receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the
concerned object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not
have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received
Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on
Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group
specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4
(IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5
(erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the
procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining
message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to
cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence
Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in
accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is
specified in subclause 10.3.6.
### 10.3.2 Criticality Information
In the RNSAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs
and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to
act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e. the
entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended
shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as
specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE
group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the
Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality
Information for an IE/IE group are:
1\. Reject IE;
2\. Ignore IE and Notify Sender;
3\. Ignore IE.
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE
group or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on
criticality information is applicable:
1\. IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for
one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups
specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered
comprehended by a receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2\. EP: The comprehension of different Eps within a standard version or
between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not
supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that
standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be
applied.
### 10.3.3 Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer
syntax, RNSAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is
optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence
field f the concerned object of class RNSAP-PROTOCOL-IES, RNSAP-PROTOCOL-IES-
PAIR, RNSAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or RNSAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
  1. Optional;
  2. Conditional;
  3. Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of
the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition
is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an
abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the
IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version
of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due
to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
### 10.3.4 Not Comprehended IE/IE Group
#### 10.3.4.1 Procedure ID
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of the _Procedure ID_ according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure ID_ marked with "_Reject IE_ "
which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall reject
the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure ID_ marked with "_Ignore IE and
Notify Sender_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving
node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure ID_ marked with "_Ignore IE_ "
which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore
the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report
an ignored procedure it shall include the _Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering
Message_ IE, and the _Procedure Criticality_ IE in the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE.
#### 10.3.4.1A Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the _Type of Message_ IE, the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
#### 10.3.4.2 IEs Other Than the Procedure ID and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of an IE/IE group other than the _Procedure ID_ IE and _Type of
Message_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with "_Reject IE_ " which the receiving node does not
comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed.
The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one
or more IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful
outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating
message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with "_Reject IE_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with "_Reject IE_ , that the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and
initiate local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " which the receiving
node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the
not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups, and report in the response message of the
procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In case the
information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a
value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the
receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error
Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " which the receiving node
does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to
report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with "_Ignore IE_ " which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE
groups.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with "_Ignore IE_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups
and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were
not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "_Reject IE_ " or
"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using a response message defined for the
procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In
the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_
IE shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is
not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "_Reject IE_ " or
"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using the Error Indication procedure, the
_Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_ IE,
the _Transaction ID_ IE, and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_
IE shall be included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported
IE/IE group. In the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the
_Repetition Number_ IE shall be included and in addition, if the not
comprehended IE/IE group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see
annex C) also the _Message Structure_ IE shall be included.
### 10.3.5 Missing IE or IE Group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the
criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message
specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
**Reject IE:**
  * If a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Reject IE_ "; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Reject IE_ ", the receiving node shall terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Reject IE_ , the receiving node shall consider the
procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ ", the
receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the
procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and report
in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups were
missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was
insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present
in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ ", the receiving
node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure
based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
\- If a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ ", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Ignore IE_ ", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
\- If a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Ignore IE_ ", the receiving node shall ignore that
those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the
other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Reject IE_ "
or "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using a response message defined for the
procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In
the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_
IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at
message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Reject IE_ "
or "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using the Error Indication procedure, the
_Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_ IE,
the _Transaction ID_ IE, and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_
IE shall be included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported
IE/IE group. In the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the
_Repetition Number_ IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE
group is not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex C) also the
_Message Structure_ IE shall be included.
### 10.3.6 IEs or IE Groups Received in Wrong Order or With Too Many
Occurrences or Erroneously Present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences
is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present
when the condition is not met (i.e. erroneously present), the receiving node
shall behave according to the following:
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing IEs or IE
groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present,
none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The
receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value "Abstract
Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)" using the message normally used to
report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received
in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs
that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful
outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
  * If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and use cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)".
  * If a _response_ message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
> When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the
> specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.
## 10.4 Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but
the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e. semantic
error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the
receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed
(unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary
procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IEs/IE groups
containing the erroneous values.
**Class 1:**
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure,
and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this
message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values
are:
**Protocol Causes:**
1\. Semantic Error;
2\. Message not Compatible with Receiver State.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The
_Procedure ID_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE and the _Transaction ID_ IE
within the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to
identify the message containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure,
the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error
handling shall be initiated.
**Class 2:**
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the
procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be
initiated with an appropriate cause value. The _Procedure ID_ IE, the
_Triggering Message_ IE and the _Transaction ID_ IE within the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to identify the message
containing the logical error.
## 10.5 Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence
over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
\- If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or
Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not
trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error
handling.
\- In case a response message or ERROR INDICATION message needs to be
returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that
message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully
terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value shall
reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if one or
more abstract syntax errors with criticality "ignore and notify" have earlier
occurred within the same procedure.

the DRNS
# A.1 Deriving Allocation Information for a Radio Link
## A.1.1 Establishment of a New Radio Link
The Allocation Information for a Radio Link in the case of establishment of a
new Radio Link shall be derived as follows:
\- The latest received _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for each transport
channel shall be used.
Note: The _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for a transport channel may have
been received in\ a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for
the UE in the DRNS or\ b) a procedure adding or modifying the transport
channel.
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
all transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link is set to "no
priority", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link shall be set to "shall
not trigger pre-emption".
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
one or more of the transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link
is not set to "no priority", the allocation priority and the pre-emption
capability of the Radio Link shall be set according to the following:
\- The transport channels that have the _Priority Level_ IE in the
_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE set to "no priority" shall be excluded when
setting the allocation priority and pre-emption capability of a Radio Link.
\- The allocation priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority
level, given by the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_
IE, for all non excluded transport channels that are intended to use the Radio
Link.
\- If all non-excluded transport channels that are intended to use a Radio
Link to be established have the pre-emption capability, given by the _Pre-
emption Capability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, set to
"shall not trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link
shall be set to "shall not trigger pre-emption".\ If one or more non-excluded
transport channels that are intended to use the Radio Link to be established
have the value of the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention
Priority_ IE set to "may trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of
the Radio Link shall be set to "may trigger pre-emption".
The derived allocation priority and pre-emption capability are only valid
during this allocation/retention process.
## A.1.2 Modification of an Existing Radio Link
The Allocation Information for a Radio Link in the case of modification of a
Radio Link (addition or modification of transport channels using the Radio
Link) shall be derived as follows:
\- The latest received _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for each transport
channel shall be used.
Note: The _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for a transport channel may have
been received in\ a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for
the UE in the DRNS,\ b) a previous procedure adding or modifying the transport
channel, or\ c) the current procedure adding or modifying the transport
channel.
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
all transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link is set to "no
priority", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall
be set to "shall not trigger pre-emption".
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
one or more of the transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio
Link is not set to "no priority", the allocation priority of and the pre-
emption capability of the Radio Link to be modified shall be set according to
the following:
\- The transport channels to be added or modified that have the _Priority
Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE set to "no priority" shall
be excluded when setting the allocation priority and pre-emption capability of
a Radio Link to be modified.
\- The allocation priority for a Radio Link to be modified shall be set to
highest priority level, given by the _Priority Level_ IE in the
_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, for all the non-excluded transport
channels that are to be added or modified.
\- If all non-excluded transport channels that are to be added or modified in
the Radio Link have the pre-emption capability, given by the _Pre-emption
Capability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, set to "shall not
trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of the Radio Link to be
modified shall be set to "shall not trigger pre-emption".\ If one or more of
the non-excluded transport channels to be added or modified in the Radio Link
have the value of the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention
Priority_ IE set to "may trigger pre-emption", the pre-emption capability of
the Radio Link to be modified shall be set to "may trigger pre-emption".
The derived allocation priority and pre-emption capability are only valid
during this allocation/retention process.
# A.2 Deriving Retention Information for a Radio Link
The Retention Information for an existing Radio Link shall be derived as
follows:
\- The latest received _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for each transport
channel shall be used.
Note: The _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for a transport channel may have
been received in\ a) the procedure that establishes the first Radio Link for
the UE in the DRNS or\ b) a procedure adding or modifying the transport
channel.
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
one or more transport channels using the Radio Link is set to "no priority",
the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to "not pre-
emptable".
\- If the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE for
all the transport channels using the Radio Link is not set to "no priority",
the retention priority of the Radio Link and the pre-emption vulnerability of
the Radio Link shall be set according to the following:
\- The retention priority for a Radio Link shall be set to highest priority
level, given by the _Priority Level_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_
IE, for all transport channels that uses the Radio Link.
\- If all transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the pre-emption
vulnerability, given by the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE in the
_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE, set to "pre-emptable", the pre-emption
vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be set to "pre-emptable".\ If one or
more transport channels that uses the Radio Link have the value of the _Pre-
emption Vulnerability_ IE in the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE set to
"not pre-emptable", the pre-emption vulnerability of the Radio Link shall be
set to "not pre-emptable".
The derived retention priority and pre-emption vulnerability are valid until
they are changed, or until the Radio Link is deleted. When new transport
channels are added to or deleted from the Radio Link or when existing
transport channels are modified with regards to the _Allocation/Retention
Priority_ IE, the retention information shall be derived again according to
above.
# A.3 The Allocation/Retention Process
The DRNS shall establish or modify the resources for a Radio Link according
to:
\- The value of the Allocation Information (allocation priority and pre-
emption capability) of the Radio to be established or modified. The Allocation
Information is derived according to clause A.1.
\- The value of the Retention Information (retention priority and pre-emption
vulnerability) of existing Radio Links. The Retention Information derived
according to clause A.2.
\- The resource situation in the DRNS.
Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption functionality is operator
dependent, the pre-emption indicators (pre-emption capability and pre-emption
vulnerability) shall be treated as follows:
> -. If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or
> modified is set to "may trigger pre-emption" and the resource situation so
> requires, the DRNS may trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4 to free
> resources for this allocation request.
>
> -. If the pre-emption capability for a Radio Link to be established or
> modified is set to "shall not trigger pre-emption", then this allocation
> request shall not trigger the pre-emption process in clause A.4.
>
> -. If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to
> "pre-emptable", then this Radio Link shall be included in the pre-emption
> process in clause A.4.
>
> -. If the pre-emption vulnerability for an existing Radio Link is set to
> "not pre-emptable", then this Radio Link shall not be included in the pre-
> emption process in clause A.4.
# A.4 The Pre-emption Process
The pre-emption process shall only pre-empt Radio Links with lower retention
priority than the allocation priority of the Radio Link to be established or
modified. The Radio Links to be pre-empted shall be selected in ascending
order of the retention priority.
When the pre-emption process detects that one or more Radio Links have to be
pre-empted to free resources for a Radio Link(s) to be established or
modified, the DRNS shall initiate the Radio Link Pre-emption procedure for all
the UE Contexts having Radio Links selected for pre-emption and start the
T~Preempt~ timer.
When enough resources are freed to establish or modify the Radio Link(s)
according to the request, the DRNS shall stop the T~Preempt~ timer and
complete the procedure that triggered the pre-emption process in accordance
with the "Successful Operation" subclause of the procedure.
If the T~Preempt~ timer expires, the DRNS shall reject the procedure that
triggered the pre-emption process and complete the procedure in accordance
with the "Unsuccessful Operation" subclause of the procedure.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Measurement Reporting
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event A" (figure B.1), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity rises
above the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis
time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the
hysteresis time.
Figure B.1: Event A reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event B" (figure B.2), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated when the measured entity falls
below the requested threshold and stays there for the requested hysteresis
time. If no hysteresis time is given, the value zero shall be used for the
hysteresis time.
Figure B.2: Event B reporting with Hysteresis Time specified
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event C" (figure B.3), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity
rises by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested
time. The reporting in figure B.3 is initiated if the Rising Time T1 is less
than the requested time.
Figure B.3: Event C reporting
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event D" (figure B.4), the
Measurement Reporting procedure is initiated always when the measured entity
falls by an amount greater than the requested threshold within the requested
time. The reporting in figureB.4 is initiated if the Falling Time T1 is less
than the requested time.
Figure B.4: Event D reporting
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event E" (figure B.5), the
Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the
measured entity rises above the "Measurement Threshold 1" and stays there for
the "Measurement Hysteresis Time" (T1 in figure B.5). If _Report Periodicity_
IE is provided DRNS shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure
periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity
falls below the "Measurement Threshold 1" and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity falls below
the "Measurement Threshold 2" and stays there for the "Measurement Hysteresis
Time" (T1) the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the
periodic reporting is terminated.
Figure B.5: Event E reporting with Hysteresis Time specified and Periodic
Reporting requested
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event F" (figure B.6), the
Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated always when the
measured entity falls below the "Measurement Threshold 1" and stays there for
the "Measurement Hysteresis Time" (T1 in figure B.6). If _Report Periodicity_
IE is provided DRNS shall also initiate Measurement Reporting procedure
periodically. The periodic reporting continues although the measured entity
rises above the "Measurement Threshold 1" and is terminated by the Report B.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measured entity rises above
the "Measurement Threshold 2" and stays there for the "Measurement Hysteresis
Time" (T1) Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B) is initiated and the
periodic reporting is terminated.
Figure B.6: Event F reporting with Hysteresis Time specified and Periodic
Reporting requested
When the _Report Characteristics_ IE is set to "Event H" (figure B.7), the
Measurement Reporting procedure (Report A) is initiated when the measurement
value of measured entity rises above the _Measurement Threshold 1_ and stays
above the threshold for the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ (T~1~ in figure
B.7).] The measurement value of measured entity in Report A substitutes the
_Measurement Base value_ for the consequent measurement reporting.
When the Report A conditions has been met and the measurement value of
measured entity rises above or falls below the _Measurement Base Value_ by
_Measurement Fluctuation Range_ (H~1~ in figure B.7), and stays there for the
_Measurement Hysteresis Time_ (T~h~ in figure B.7) counting from the beginning
of every _Report Periodicity_ , the Measurement Reporting procedure (Report B
or Report C) is initiated. The the measurement value of measured entity in
(Report B or Report C) substitutes the _Measurement Base value_ for the
consequent measurement reporting.
When the Report A conditions have been met and the measurement value of
measured entity falls below the _Measurement Threshold 2_ and stays there for
the _Measurement Hysteresis Time_ (T~h~ in figure B.7), the Measurement
Reporting procedure (Report D) is initiated and the reporting is terminated.

Note 1. The IEs F, J, and L do not have assigned criticality. The IEs F, J,
and L are consequently realised as the ASN.1 type SEQUENCE OF of "ordinary"
ASN.1 type, e.g. INTEGER. On the other hand, the repeatable IEs with assigned
criticality are realised as the ASN.1 type SEQUENCE OF of an IE object, e.g.
ProtocolIE-Single-Container.
For the corresponding ASN.1 layout, see subclause C.4.

###### ## Annex D (normative): DRNS Behaviour at SRNC or RNSAP Signalling
Bearer Failure
This annex describes the DRNC actions in the event of SRNC or RNSAP Signalling
Bearer failure when all or some of the UE Contexts related to the SRNC need to
be removed in DRNC.
# D.1 Detection of SRNC or RNSAP Signalling Bearer/Connection Failure
Termination of all or some of the UE Contexts in DRNC which are related to an
SRNC may be triggered due to failure of SRNC, RNSAP Signalling Bearer or the
Iur signalling connection of an UE(s).
## D.1.1 Termination of all UE Contexts Related to a Specific SRNC
Termination of all UE Contexts in DRNC which are related to a specific SRNC is
triggered if the RNSAP Signalling Bearer failure is detected by the RNSAP
according to the procedure described in the sub-clause 4.5.1.5.1 of TS 25.420.
By "all" UE Contexts, it means all Ues having dedicated and/or common channel
resources.
## D.1.2 Termination of Specific UE Context
Termination of a specific UE Context in DRNC is triggered for an UE which has
dedicated transport channel resources according to the procedure described in
the sub-clause 4.5.1.5.2 of TS 25.420.
# D.2 DRNC Actions at UE Context Termination
When termination of the UE Context is required, the DRNC shall remove any
common and/or dedicated radio resources related to the UE Context. The DRNC
shall also initiate release of the dedicated or common user plane resources
that were involved in these UE contexts. In addition, if it is possible the
DRNC shall release the RRC connection.
