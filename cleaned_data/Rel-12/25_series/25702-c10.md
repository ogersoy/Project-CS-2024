# 4 DCH enhancements
## 4.1 UpLink (UL) physical layer enhancements
Uplink performance of DCH in UMTS system can be improved in several ways. A
basic enhancement to UL DCH would be introduction of Frame Early Termination
(FET). Since in UMTS R99 Circuit-Switched (CS) traffic, the target BLER for
speech service is usually 1%, it is not always necessary to receive all slots
within the TTI for a successful block decoding. Once the receiver successfully
decodes the data (i.e. CRC passes), it may ask the transmitter to stop
transmission immediately, i.e., even before the TTI ends, which reduces
transmit power consumption without impact to the reception quality. A number
of modifications in UL improve the chance of FET and UE\'s battery
consumption. These modifications include for example changes to UL DPCCH slot
format to maintain ILPC timeline, changes to TPC rate to accommodate ACK
signalling, or compression/repetition in UL. In the following, solutions are
presented that incorporate these modifications to improve UL DPCH performance.
### 4.1.1 UL Frame Early Termination (FET)
#### 4.1.1.1 Option 1: Repetition of 10ms TTI frame
In this solution, the UL TTI is compressed and repeated twice to improve the
chance of FET. Several other modifications are introduced to assist with FET.
These modifications are described in this clause.
UL FET allows for termination of UL transmission and reception upon successful
decoding of UL transport block at the Node-B. The Node-B receiver attempts to
decode the UL transport block at multiple occasions within each TTI, prior to
complete reception of the transport block. Upon successful decoding, the
Node-B sends an ACK signal, allowing the UE to terminate (DTX) its UL DPDCH
transmission. The UL DPCCH carries TPC bits required for DL DCH transmission;
hence, UL DPCCH continues to be transmitted until the DL DCH transmission has
also decoded early, after which UL DPCCH is also terminated.
##### 4.1.1.1.1 Outer Loop Power Control (OLPC) algorithm in UL
In the UL, the OLPC is changed to assist FET by targeting an earlier slot
during TTI. This is shown in Figure 4.1.1.1.1‑1, where the parameter
OLPC_TARGET_SLOT specifies the location within the entire transport block
(combined repeated transport blocks) at which OLPC targets a specified BLER.
The value of OLPC_TARGET_SLOT in this study is 14, i.e., targeting the end
slot of the first block. OLPC updates the SIR target at the Node-B whenever a
successful decoding attempt occurs for any transport channel (a CRC pass), or
if decoding fails (no CRC pass) in all decoding attempts up to, and including,
the final decoding attempt no later than specified by OLPC_TARGET_SLOT.

Figure 4.1.1.1.1-1: OLPC and multiple decoding attempts
For example, Figure 4.1.1.1.1-1 shows multiple decoding attempts marked as
A,B,and C, with OLPC_TARGET_SLOT specifying location B within the transport
block to target BLER. Table 4.1.1.1.1-1describes when OLPC is updated under
different scenarios.

##### 4.1.1.1.2 UL DTCH/DCCH compression and repetition
To improve the probability of successful early decoding of UL packets, the
uplink DTCH and DCCH packets are compressed and repeated twice. At the MAC
layer, the packets received every 20ms (for DTCH) and 40ms (for DCCH) are
repeated twice. The duplicate packets are passed to the physical layer,
configured with a TTI value half of the original, i.e., DTCH packets are
configured with 10ms TTI and DCCH packets are configured with 20ms TTI; see
Figure 4.1.1.1.2-1. All physical-layer specific parameters like rate matching,
1^st^ and 2^nd^ layer interleaver parameters, spreading factor, etc. are
derived from the configured 10ms or 20ms TTI values, according to the current
3GPP specification 3GPP TS 25.212 [4].

Figure 4.1.1.1.2-1: UL DTCH packet repetition at MAC layer
#### 4.1.1.2 Option 2: New rate matching and interleaving chains
Once UE is informed the successful decoding by BS, it can stop remaining
transmission before TTI ends to save transmit power. Early Termination
Indicator (ETI) is transmitted every two slots in this example, and a positive
value indicates successful decoding by the receiver. In case 750Hz transmit
power control rate is used, the spare TPC bits can be used for conveying the
ETI. Figure 4.1.1.2-1 shows an example of the early termination flow. As seen,
the BS performs some decoding attempts and got a successful decoding. It then
informs UE to stop remaining transmission by sending ACKs.
{width="6.0in" height="1.6888888888888889in"}
Figure 4.1.1.2-1: An example of UL data transmission with Early Termination
(ET)
When both DL and UL data transmission are early terminated, DPCCH can be also
terminated with negligible degradation of system performance. As shown in
Figure 4.1.1.2-2, UE stops UL DPCCH transmission from slot 18 to slot 26. The
period is called _ET gap_.
{width="6.677777777777778in" height="1.448611111111111in"}
Figure 4.1.1.2-2: An example of ET Gap
##### 4.1.1.2.1 Encoding procedure of UL Early Termination (ET)
An example of modified encoding procedure for CS links to facilitate early
termination is illustrated in Figure 4.1.1.2.1‑1. The details of each block
are described in the following subclauses.
{width="6.008333333333334in" height="2.7083333333333335in"}
Figure 4.1.1.2.1-1: Block diagram of UL encoding procedure
##### 4.1.1.2.2 Transport block concatenation for single TrCH
For the sake of a simpler encoding and decoding chain, the transport blocks
usually carried on separate Transport Channels (TrCH) in current R99 are
instead concatenated into a single transport block, carried on one single
TrCH. For example, there are 4 TrCHs for AMR fixed 12.2k, as shown in Table
4.1.1.2.2-1.
Table 4.1.1.2.2-1: TrCHs for AMR fixed 12.2k
+----------------------+---------+---------+---------+------+ | Logical channel type | DTCH | DTCH | DTCH | DCCH | | | | | | | | | Class A | Class B | Class C | | +----------------------+---------+---------+---------+------+ | TTI(ms) | 20 | 20 | 20 | 40 | +----------------------+---------+---------+---------+------+
20ms TTI is applied in the above procedure. To simplify the procedure and to
guarantee DCCH BLER, DCCH is transmitted twice within its 40ms TTI. When DCCH
is transmitted, the four transport blocks are multiplexed into a single TrCH;
otherwise the other three transport blocks are multiplexed together.
##### 4.1.1.2.3 CRC attachment
TFCI-based transmission is commonly applied in UL. In legacy system, 12-bit
CRC is attached to the TrCH for DTCH Class A. For the new TrCH described
above, 16-bit CRC is suggested since it carries more information bits than the
TrCH for DTCH Class A. In case of speech muting (i.e. no information bits to
be transmitted), CRC is not attached due to TFCI-based transmission. It is
noted that TFCI early decoding has to be implemented in Node-B to realize
early termination.
##### 4.1.1.2.4 Channel coding
The R99 convolutional code is reused for the modified encoding chain.
##### 4.1.1.2.5 Rate matching and interleaving
Rate matching and interleaving mechanisms are modified and are illustrated in
Figure 4.1.1.2.5-1.\ The procedure is performed by TTI basis and there is no
radio frame segmentation as in the current R99.\ In the legacy system,
flexible spreading factor is applied. The smaller the spreading factor is, the
more is the number of bits can be transmitted within a TTI, which implies more
bits can be collected in an earlier stage to increase the chance of early
termination. Simulation results show that a fixed spreading factor value of 32
is preferable by early termination. In this case, if the number of encoded
bits is not greater than the number of available physical bits (i.e. the
number of bits which can be transmitted by the used DPDCH), intra-coded-block
interleaving is applied followed by repetition. The purpose is to transmit the
first copy of the coded block as earlier as possible. On the other hand, if
the number of encoded bits is greater than the number of available physical
bits, puncturing is applied first followed by intra-coded-block interleaving.
The puncturing mechanism in current R99 can be used, and the block interleaver
of second interleaving in current R99 can be used for interleaving both in
puncturing case and in repetition case.

##### 4.1.1.2.6 Physical channel mapping
This follows the original R99 procedure including modulation and spreading.
##### 4.1.1.2.7 Stop data transmission based on early termination indicator
This is the most important block for the early termination feature. Once UE is
informed the successful decoding by BS, it can stop remaining transmission
before TTI ends to save transmit power. Early Termination Indicator (ETI) is
transmitted every two slots in this example, and a positive value indicates
successful decoding by the receiver.\ In case 750Hz transmit power control
rate is used, the spare TPC bits can be used for conveying the ETI.\ Figure
4.1.1.2.7-1 shows an example of the early termination flow. As seen, the BS
performs some decoding attempts and got a successful decoding. It then informs
UE to stop remaining transmission by sending ACKs.

Figure 4.1.1.2.7-1: Example of UL data transmission with Early Termination
(ET)
There are several advantages when the proposed early termination mechanism
works with the optimized transmit power control rate as proposed. First, the
spare TPC symbols in UL DPCCH due to slower TPC rate can be reused to convey
the early termination indicators, so that there is no need of introducing a
new uplink channel. Likewise in the uplink direction, when the spare TPC
symbols in DL DPCCH are used for ETIs, these ETI symbols can also be used for
DL SINR estimation when the optimized DPCH slot format is used so that there
is no wasted power.
##### 4.1.1.2.8 Power adjustment
Table 4.1.1.2.8 shows the DPDCH/DPCCH power ratio when early termination is
used.

##### 4.1.1.2.9 Early Termination (ET) of both DL and UL data transmission
When both DL and UL data transmission are early terminated, DPCCH can be also
terminated with negligible degradation of system performance. As shown in
Figure 4.1.1.2.9, UE stops UL DPCCH transmission from slot 18 to slot 26. The
period is called _ET gap_.
{width="6.677777777777778in" height="1.448611111111111in"}
Figure 4.1.1.2.9: Example of UL data transmission with Early Termination (ET)
##### 4.1.1.2.10 TFCI based transmission
The original TFCI (10, 32) code is still applied with early decoding. The
maximum number of TFC for 12.2k services is 16, which means only 4 bits out of
10 TFCI bits are valid. When 4 bits are encoded to 32 bits, the probability of
a successful decoding before the whole 32 bits are fully collected is quite
high. Whenever BS tries to decode the data, it first performs early decoding
for TFCI. This is called TFCI early decoding.
### 4.1.2 UL DPCCH slot format optimization
#### 4.1.2.1 Option 1: Removing TFCI fields
To assist UL FET, TFCI information needs to be delivered to Node-B as early as
possible. To this end, the TFCI is transmitted on a new channel during the
first two slots of DPDCH TTI, in a format similar to the CQI transmission on
HS-DPCCH. This new control channel, referred to as FET-DPCCH, reuses the
design of HS-DPCCH, with the CQI being replaced by TFCI and the ACK being used
to enable DL FET. This new channel implies that TFCI need not be carried on
the UL DPCCH anymore, so UL DPCCH shall use slot-format 1, with 8 pilot bits
and 2 TPC bits in each slot, and no TFCI bits.
UL DPCCH channel may also use a new slot format, called slot format 5, which
is identical to slot-format 1 except that the two TPC bits are placed before,
instead of after, the 8 pilot bits. The motivation for this enhancement is to
preserve the ability to achieve 1 slot delay for the inner-loop power control
(ILPC) in downlink, as explained in Figures 4.1.2.1-1 and 4.1.2.1-2. Slot
format 5 is designed to maintain the ILPC timeline when dedicated pilots in
the DL DPCCH channel are removed as part of a proposed DL DPCCH enhancement
for DL overhead optimization.

Figure 4.1.2-2: New UL DPCCH slot-format 5 and its use in achieving 1 slot DL
ILPC delay
#### 4.1.2.2 Option 2: Reusing legacy UL DPCCH slot format
With reduced TPC rate, the spared TPC fields in UL DPCCH can be reused for ACK
and thus, the legacy UL DPCCH slot format can be reused.
#### 4.1.2.3 Option 3: Relocation of TFCI fields
Alternatively, the TFCI information bits could be reduced to 5 to 7 bits and
could be delivered to Node-B in the first 7 slots of UL DPCCH, while the FET
ACK/NACK indication is transmitted in the remaining slots, as explained in
clause 4.1.3.2. The slot format of UL DPCCH is identical to slot format 0A
except that the TFCI information and the FET ACK/NACK indication are
transmitted in a TDM manner within a 20ms TTI.
For this new uplink DPCCH format, the existing DPCCH slot format #0A in the
Table 2 of **3GPP TS 25.211**[15] could be reused, except that the TFCI and
the FET ACK are sharing the same field and that the transmitted slots per
radio frame are extended to 15. The DPCCH fields for the new uplink DPCCH are
re-captured in Table 4.1.3.2-1.
Table 4.1.2.3-1: DPCCH fields for new uplink DPCCH
Slot Format #i | Channel Bit Rate (kbps) | Channel Symbol Rate (kbps) | SF | Bits/ Frame | Bits/ Slot | Npilot | NTPC | NTFCI / NACK | NFBI | Transmitted slots per radio frame  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
0A | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 15  
### 4.1.3 UL ACK indication for DL frame Early Termination (ET)
#### 4.1.3.1 Option 1: New FET control channel
The FET-DPCCH is a new UL channel that reuses the structure of HS-DPCCH
channel to carry TFCI information and the ACK signal for DL FET. The TFCI
information is encoded using the (20,5) Reed Muller code currently used for
CQI encoding in the HS-DPCCH channel, and is transmitted during the first two
slots of DTCH TTI. Subsequent slots after TFCI is sent are dedicated to
transmission of the ACK signal. This is illustrated in Figure 4.1.3.1-1. With
the DL enhancement of 2-user TDM as described in clause 4.2.2, the DL packet
only occupies a 10ms duration, and hence the Ack signal is not needed during
the second 10ms duration of the UL packet.
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="2.952777777777778in"}
Figure 4.1.3.1-1: New UL control channel (FET-DPCCH)
#### 4.1.3.2 Option 2: TDM of FET ACK and TFCI in DPCCH
An alternative approach to transmit the ACK message on the UL is to TDM the
ACK message with UL DPCCH.\ To this end, the new uplink DPCCH format described
in clause 4.1.2.3 is used as depicted in Figure 4.1.3.2-1. The TFCI
information and the FET ACK/NACK indication are transmitted in a TDM manner
within a 20ms TTI, where the TFCI is transmitted to the Node-B as early as
possible to assist DL FET, for example, in the first 7 slots while the FET
ACK/NACK indication is transmitted in the remaining slots.

The TFCI is encoded using a (20, 5) or (20, 7) code depending on the number of
TFCI information bits.\ The coding procedure is as shown in Figure 4.1.3.2-2.
Figure 4.1.3.2-2: Channel coding of TFCI information bits
The code words of the (20, 5) code are a linear combination of the 5 basis
sequences denoted M~i,n~ defined in the Table 4.1.3.2-3 (same as the Table 15A
of 3GPP TS 25.212 [4]). The code words of the (20, 7) code are a linear
combination of the basis sequences denoted M~i,n~ defined in the Table
4.1.3.2-4 (same as the Table 15C of [4]) for
{width="1.25in" height="0.23958333333333334in"}.
The TFCI information bits a~0,~ a~1,~ a~2,~ a~3,~ a~4~ or a~0,~ a~1,~ a~2,~
a~3,~ a~4,~ a~5,~ a~6~ (where a~0~ is LSB and a~6~ is MSB) correspond to the
TFC index (expressed in unsigned binary form) defined by the RRC layer to
reference the TFC of the CCTrCH in the associated DPCH radio frame.
The output code word bits b~i~ are given by:
> for the (20, 5) code, $b_{i} = \sum_{n = 0}^{4}{(a_{n}} \times

#### 4.1.3.3 Option 3: FET ACK using spared TPC symbols
To realize early termination, Early Termination Indicator (ETI) is required.
In case of 750Hz TPC rate, the spared TPC symbols are used to transmit ETI. An
example of ETI feedback is illustrated in Figure 4.1.3.3-1. As seen, UE
collects data slot 0 to slot 6 and performs BTFD. If the data is successfully
decoded (i.e. CRC passed), a positive ETI is sent in UL DPCCH in slot 7 to
inform Node-B to terminate DL data transmission. Otherwise, a negative ETI is
sent in UL DPCCH in slot 7 to inform Node-B. The ETIs can be sent every two
slots in UL DPCCH from slot 1 to slot 29.\ An ETI feedback mask can also be
defined to indicate which slots ETI can be sent in. For example, a feedback
mask [7:2:27] means ETIs can be sent every two slots in slot 7 to slot 27, and
the corresponding early decoding attempts occur every two slots starting from
slot 6 to slot 26.

In case of dynamic TPC Rate (i.e., TPC symbols are only replaced by ETI
according to the defined ETI feedback mask), the TPC rate will not be
constant. As shown in Figure 4.1.3.3-2, the ETI feedback mask is [7:2:27], and
there is one period with TPC rate 1500Hz and the other one period with TPC
rate 750Hz.

## 4.2 Downlink physical layer enhancements
### 4.2.1 Downlink Frame Early Termination (FET)
#### 4.2.1.1 Option 1: Shortened TTI
A key aspect of the study item is frame early termination, which provides both
link-efficiency and battery life improvements. On the downlink, decoding is
attempted at several intermediate points in time prior to reception of the
complete 10ms packet; eg, every slot starting after the 3^rd^ slot. The
initial slots are skipped since they contain insufficient data for successful
decoding. The early decoding will often succeed, owing to the excess SNR
inherent in a power-controlled link. On success, the UE sends an Ack signal to
inform the Node-B to stop its DL DPDCH transmission, thus achieving link
efficiency gain. The DL DPCCH carries TPC bits that are required by the UE to
make uplink transmissions; hence the DL DPCCH continues to be transmitted.
Note that when the new pilot-free slot-format is used for DL DPCH, the DL
DPCCH only carries only the TPC bits, which occupy a small fraction of each
slot. Hence the UE can obtain DRX battery life savings by waking up only to
read these TPC bits. If the uplink voice frame has also been decoded early,
even the DL DPCCH transmissions are unnecessary (assuming no other UL
transmissions are needed; i.e., not in a multi-RAB call), and the entire DL
DCH transmission can be DTXed. This allows further DRX battery savings as well
as link-efficiency savings from reduced DL transmissions. In this situation,
the DL DPCCH transmission is resumed a few slots prior to the start of the
next DL voice packet, to allow the UE receiver filters to refresh their states
on waking up from DRX.
##### 4.2.1.1.1 DCCH indicator bit, choice of CRC length and transport
channels
On the downlink, each DCCH packet is multiplexed with two DTCH packets as
shown in Figure 4.2.4.1-2. Hence the DTCH may be decoded early while DCCH has
not yet decoded. In this situation, the UE must avoid sending the Ack
requesting Node-B to turn off the DL DPDCH, so as to avoid losing the DCCH
packet. To assist the UE in recognizing this situation, a single DCCH
indicator bit is appended to each DL DTCH packet prior to CRC attachment, as
shown in Figure 4.2.1.1.1. Thus, the TBSs usually used with R99 voice on the
DL must all be increased by 1 bit.\ This bit is required because slot-formats
for voice on downlink do not usually include TFCI signaling (i.e., UE uses
BTFD), so there is no existing mechanism to identify whether DCCH is present.
UE receiver-only mechanisms such as detecting energy in DCCH bits are likely
to be unreliable, especially at the very early DTCH decode attempts.\ The DCCH
indicator bit is unnecessary on the uplink, since the uplink relies on TFCI
transmission by UE rather than on blind transport format detection by Node-B
receiver.
Early decoding increases the overall probability of false CRC pass, because
there are multiple decoding attempts made, and a false CRC pass could happen
on any of them, further false CRC passes are also more likely at earlier
decoding attempts where there is less information available to the decoder. To
combat this issue, a larger CRC size can be used. Currently AMR voice over DCH
usually uses 12 bit CRC for DTCH and 16 bit CRC for DCCH. The 16 bit CRC could
also be used for DTCH in order to support FET, on both the uplink and
downlink.
Currently AMR voice frames consist of separate classes of bits (class A,B,C
for AMR12.2K and class A,B for AMR5.9K), which are separately encoded and
carried on separate transport channels, and CRC protection is used only for
the class-A bits. If the same approach is used in conjunction with FET, the
BER of the class B and C bits may be higher than that in current systems if
the voice frame transmission is terminated upon successful early decoding of
class-A bits. To avoid this problem, the class A,B and C bits are concatenated
together and jointly encoded on a single transport channel, both on uplink and
downlink.

Figure 4.2.1.1.1: In-band signaling of DCCH presence/absence
#### 4.2.1.2 Option 2: New rate matching and interleaving
For UMTS R99 circuit-switched traffic, the target BLER for speech service is
at the order of 0.01. In most cases, it is not necessary to receive all slots
within TTI for a successful block decoding. Once the receiver successfully
decoded the data (i.e. CRC passed), it may ask the transmitter to stop
transmission immediately before TTI ends, which reduces transmit power
consumption but has no impact to the receiving quality. The mechanism is more
power efficient and can support more Circuit Switched (CS) speech links
simultaneously. In addition, CS links with Early Termination (ET) introduce
less interference to other communication links and hence can contribute to the
quality of HSPA services.
##### 4.2.1.2.1 Encoding procedure of DL Early Termination (ET)
An example of modified encoding procedure for CS links to facilitate ET is
illustrated in Figure 4.2.1.2.1-1. The following subclauses describe the
detail of each block.
{width="6.008333333333334in" height="2.7083333333333335in"}
Figure 4.2.1.2.1-1: Block diagram of DL encoding procedure
##### 4.2.1.2.2 Transport block concatenation for single TrCH
For the sake of a simpler encoding and decoding chain, the transport blocks
usually carried on separate transport channels (TrCH) in current R99 are
instead concatenated into a single transport block, carried on one single
TrCH.\ For example, there are 4 TrCHs for AMR 12.2k, as shown in Table
4.2.1.2.2-1.
Table 4.2.1.2.2-1: TrCHs for AMR 12.2k over R99 DCH
+----------------------+---------+---------+---------+------+ | Logical channel type | DTCH | DTCH | DTCH | DCCH | | | | | | | | | Class A | Class B | Class C | | +----------------------+---------+---------+---------+------+ | TTI(ms) | 20 | 20 | 20 | 40 | +----------------------+---------+---------+---------+------+
20ms TTI is applied in the above procedure. To simplify the procedure and to
guarantee DCCH BLER, DCCH is transmitted twice within its 40ms TTI. When DCCH
is transmitted, the four transport blocks are multiplexed into a single TrCH;
otherwise the other three transport blocks are multiplexed together.
##### 4.2.1.2.3 CRC attachment
BTFD is suggested for the modified encoding chain because we observed that
BTFD-based slot format is more power efficient compared to TFCI-based slot
format. In this case, CRC is always attached for RX decoding. To achieve an
acceptable false detection rate, 16-bit CRC is suggested. For the speech Mute
case, i.e., there is no information bit to be transmitted, all the CRC are
zero.
##### 4.2.1.2.4 Channel coding
The R99 convolutional code is reused for the modified encoding chain.
##### 4.2.1.2.5 Rate matching and interleaving
Rate matching and interleaving mechanisms are modified and are illustrated in
Figure 4.2.1.2.5-1. The procedure is performed on a TTI basis and there is no
radio frame segmentation as in the current R99. If the number of encoded bits
is less than or equal to the number of available physical bits (i.e. the
number of bits which can be transmitted by the used DPDCH), the intra-coded-
block interleaving is applied and repetition is performed afterward. The
purpose is to transmit the first copy of the coded block as earlier as
possible. On the other hand, if the number of encoded bits is greater than the
number of available physical bits, puncturing is applied and then intra-coded-
block interleaving is performed. The puncturing mechanism in current R99 can
be used, and the block interleaver of second interleaving in current R99 can
be used for interleaving both in puncturing case and in repetition case.

##### 4.2.1.2.6 Physical channel mapping
This follows the original R99 procedure including modulation and spreading.
##### 4.2.1.2.7 Stop data transmission based on early termination indicator
This is the most important block for the early termination feature. Once BS is
informed the successful decoding by UE, it can stop remaining transmission
before TTI ends to save transmit power. Early Termination Indicator (ETI) is
transmitted every two slots in this example, and a positive value indicates
successful decoding by the receiver. In case 750Hz transmit power control rate
is used, the spare TPC bits can be used for conveying the ETI.\ Figure
4.2.1.2.7-1 shows an example of the early termination flow. As seen, the UE
performs some decoding attempts and got a successful decoding. It then informs
BS to stop remaining transmission by sending ACKs.
{width="6.0in" height="1.6979166666666667in"}
Figure 4.2.1.2.7-1: Example of DL data transmission with early termination
There are several advantages when the proposed early termination mechanism
works with 750Hz transmit power control rate. First, the spare TPC symbols in
UL DPCCH due to slower TPC rate can be reused to convey the early termination
indicators, so that there is no need of introducing new uplink channel.
Likewise in the uplink direction, when the spare TPC symbols in DL DPCCH are
used for ETIs, these ETI symbols can also be used for DL SINR estimation when
the optimized DPCH slot format is used so that there is no wasted power.
##### 4.2.1.2.8 Power adjustment
In this example, DTX bits are not inserted into DPDCH and power adjustment is
applied instead. The basic idea is to have more power on the coded block with
more coded bits. The final applied DPDCH power is proportional to the number
of coded bits. DPDCH power is maintained by power control. Based on packet
types, different DPDCH power adjustment is introduced. The concept is similar
to β~d~/β~c~ in UL. Table 4.2.1.2.8-1 shows a DPDCH power adjustment example.
For example, it is assumed X dB Ec/Ior is to be applied on DPDCH in specific
slot in absence of DPDCH power adjustment. Based on this table, if packet type
is Full, the adjusted DPDCH power is X dB. If the packet type is SID, the
adjusted DPDCH power is (X-6.29), and if the packet type is Null, the adjusted
DPDCH power is X-10.4 dB.

* * *
Packet Null SID Full DPDCH power adjustment (dB) -10.48 -6.29 0

##### 4.2.1.2.9 Early termination of both DL and UL data transmission
When both DL and UL data are early terminated, DPCCH can be also terminated
with negligible degradation of system performance. As shown in Figure
4.2.1.2.9-1, BS stops UL DPCCH transmission from slot 19 to slot 26. The
period is called _ET gap_.
{width="85.32291666666667in" height="1.448611111111111in"}
Figure 4.2.1.2.9-1: Example of DL data transmission with early termination
##### 4.2.1.2.10 TFCI based or BTFD based transmission
BTFD-based transmission is the most popular in the legacy DL system and hence
is also used in the proposed DL early termination scheme. In this case, UE
tries every possible TFC candidates at each decoding attempt.\ Note that DL ET
is also feasible for TFCI-based transmission.
#### 4.2.1.3 Option 3: Reusing legacy TTI
In clause 4.2.1.1 FET Option 1, DL transmission occurs over 10ms TTIs, and two
users share the same spreading code. In this solution, the key difference is
that DL transmission still uses 20ms TTIs. In comparison to FET Option 1, this
approach does not require user pairing, at the expense of less gating
opportunity for UE.\ This solution follows mostly the principles outlined in
other solutions, with specific changes to slot format, encoding, and rate
matching as described in this clause.
The design uses 20ms TTI for voice frames, just as in current R99. The only
change required to the current R99 slot-formats is to eliminate the pilot
bits. The spreading factor in this design is the same as that in the current
R99, as described in clause 4.2.2.1.
##### 4.2.1.3.1 Joint encoding and FET
As in FET Option 1, the class-A,B and C bits in AMR full-rate frames are
concatenated together and sent on a single transport channel; thus there are
only two transport channels, one for DTCH (carrying voice frames) and one for
DCCH (carrying SRB). Similar to FET Option 1, the DTCH uses 16-bit CRC and
rate 1/3 convolutional encoding. In contrast to FET Option 1, however, the
DCCH indicator bit in clause 4.2.1.1.1 is not required, due to a modification
in the rate-matching scheme to be described next.
##### 4.2.1.3.2 Pseudo-flexible RM: Sharing DCCH bits with DTCH
Currently voice over R99 downlink uses fixed Rate-Matching (RM), as a result
of which the bit positions reserved for DCCH cannot be re-used by DTCH even
when DCCH does not carry a transport block. This simplifies the complexity of
BTFD procedure at the UE, since the transport-channel de-multiplexing
operation does not need to be repeated for each BTFD hypothesis. Flexible
rate-matching as defined in current R99 does allow some reuse of DCCH bit
positions for DTCH when DCCH does not carry a transport block, but currently
requires transmission of TFCI to avoid the extra BTFD complexity due to the
loss of the above-mentioned simplification possible in fixed RM. Pseudo-
flexible RM combines the merits of both the fixed and flexible RM schemes. In
pseudo-flexible RM, the transmitter operation is similar to the current fixed-
RM scheme, however the RM attributes used are different, depending on whether
or not DCCH transport channel is present or not. Specifically, the RM
attributes signalled to the UE as in current R99 are used when DCCH transport
block is transmitted, whereas when DCCH is not transmitted, the RM attribute
of the DCCH transport channel is set to zero. This is illustrated in Figure
4.2.1.3.2-1.
Figure 4.2.1.3.2-1: Comparing R99 fixed RM and pseudo-flexible RM
The advantage of pseudo-flexible RM is to allow using DCCH bit positions by
DTCH when DCCH does not carry a transport block. This makes more DPDCH bits
available to the voice packets, thus allowing increased repetition which
improves performance of FET. At the same time, there is only a modest increase
in UE decoding complexity:\ The UE first decodes under the hypothesis that
DCCH is absent, and if unsuccessful, repeats under the hypothesis that DCCH is
present. If early decoding is attempted, the hypothesis that DCCH is present
needs to be tested only at a subset of the early decoding attempts; eg, it
could be tested only at the last attempt when the whole DTCH packet has been
received. This is because under this hypothesis, both DTCH and DCCH must
decode early for FET to be possible, and this is unlikely until most of the
transmission has been completed. Since DCCH packet transmission is fairly rare
(1-2%), the extra complexity of this scheme is small. Thus, BTFD is still
possible and there is no need to signal the TFCI.
The DCCH presence indication bit as in FET Option 1 is not required, since the
UE automatically detects whether or not the DCCH has been transmitted based on
which of the two hypotheses succeeds. Thus there is no need for in-band
signalling of DCCH presence via a DCCH-indicator bit appended to the DTCH
packet as in clause 4.2.1.1.1.
### 4.2.2 DL DPCCH slot format optimization
A significant portion of power in downlink Circuit-Switched (CS) voice
transmission over DCH is consumed on dedicated pilots, used for received
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) measurements and power control. However, SNR
measurements could also be performed on other control channel (DPCCH) or data
channel (DPDCH) symbols, eg; using the TPC bits instead of pilots. This
eliminates the need for dedicated pilots for power control. The freed-up pilot
bit positions can be re-allocated to data bits. As shown in Figure 4.2.2 for a
voice-only scenario, on the downlink, close to 24% of the total power profile
is spent on transmitting dedicated pilots. Hence, significant improvements in
link efficiency and inter-cell interference can be achieved by this
enhancement. To this end, new slot-formats are defined in which pilot bits are
eliminated.

on DCH.\ Fixed overhead includes common pilot and broadcast channels
#### 4.2.2.1 Option 1: Removal of dedicated pilots
The design uses 20ms TTI for voice frames, just as in current R99. The only
change required to the current R99 slot-formats is to eliminate the pilot
bits. The spreading factor in this design is the same as that in the current
R99. The new slot formats are described in Table 4.2.2.1.
Table 4.2.2.1: Enhanced DL DPCH slot formats
Vocoder | Slot Format #i | Channel Bit Rate (kbps) | Channel Symbol Rate (ksps) | SF | Bits/ Slot | DPDCH Bits/Slot | DPCCH Bits/Slot | Transmitted slots per radio frame NTr |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
|  |  |  |  |  | NData1 | NData2 | NTPC | NTFCI | NPilot |   
AMR 5.9K | 25 | 30 | 15 | 256 | 20 | 2 | 16 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 15  
AMR 12.2K | 26 | 60 | 30 | 128 | 40 | 6 | 32 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 15  
#### 4.2.2.2 Option 2: Removal of dedicated pilots and optimizing TPC field
The downlink DPCH (DL Dedicated Physical Channel) is a time multiplex of DL
DPDCH (Dedicated Physical Data Channel) and DL DPCCH (Dedicated Physical
Control Channel). DL DPCCH occupies considerable ratio of the DL DPCH. For
example, in slot format #8, it is commonly observed in field trials that DPCCH
occupies 15% of the slot. Therefore, the downlink DPCCH can be further
optimized to improve the efficiency of data transmission. The existing design
on DL DPCH slot format is tightly coupled with both downlink and uplink
transmission power control. Therefore optimizations of the DPCH slot format
shall take account of quality of SINR estimation, error rate of transmit power
control command and round trip delay thereof, as described in the following
sessions.
In this clause, 4 new DL DPCH slot formats (#17, #18, #19 and #20) are
proposed, as shown in Table 4.2.2.2-1. The new slot formats are
transformations of the legacy slot format #8 with pilot fields being removed,
as illustrated in Figure 4.2.2.2-1.
Table 4.2.2.2-1: The proposed new DL DPCH slot formats
Slot Format #i | Channel Bit Rate (kbps) | Channel Symbol Rate (ksps) | SF | Bits/ Slot | DPDCH Bits/Slot | DPCCH Bits/Slot | Transmitted slots per radio frame NTr |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
|  |  |  |  | NData1 | NData2 | NTPC | NTFCI | NPilot |   
17 | 60 | 30 | 128 | 40 | 6 | 32 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 15  
18 | 60 | 30 | 128 | 40 | 4 | 32 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 15  
19 | 60 | 30 | 128 | 40 | 38 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 15  
20 | 60 | 30 | 128 | 40 | 36 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 15  
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: Illustration of the proposed new DL DPCH slot formats
Slot format #17 is a transformation of slot format #8 with pilot field being
replaced by data2 field.
Slot format #18 is similar to slot format #17 but 2 TPC symbols are
transmitted. Since the number of TPC symbols is doubled in slot format #18,
the TPC power offset can be reduced by 3dB (compared with slot format #17) to
achieve similar link performance (i.e. TPC command error rate, DTCH BLER and
required DL DPCH_Ec/Ior) as slot format #17. With such characteristic, slot
format #18 reduces the Node-B transmit power variation across symbols and
reduces the chance of being limited by the maximum transmit power of Node-B.
Once the pilot filed is removed, TPC bits are the only bits in the DPCCH for
BTFD-based scenarios. The TPC field can also be located at the end of the
slot, which produces slot format #19 and slot format #20.
Since the DL DPCH slot format is tightly coupled with downlink and uplink
transmission power control, the downlink and uplink transmission power control
loop are modified for the aforementioned new slot formats as described below.
Figure 4.2.2.2-2 illustrates the UL/DL TPC timing for slot format #8, which
assumes 1 slot delay of DL TPC and 2 slot delay of UL TPC.
Figure 4.2.2.2-2: TPC timing diagrams for legacy DL DPCH slot format #8
Figure 4.2.2.2-3 illustrates the UL/DL TPC timing for slot format #17. The
delay of DL TPC and UL TPC is 2 slots now since the position of TPC field
remains unchanged.
Figure 4.2.2.2-3: TPC timing diagrams for proposed new DL DPCH slot format #17
Figure 4.2.2.2-4 illustrates the UL/DL TPC timing for slot format #20. The DL
TPC delay is 1 slot and UL TPC delay is 2 slots, which are the same as the
legacy format.
Figure 4.2.2.2-4: TPC timing diagrams for proposed new DL DPCH slot format #20
In case of slot formats #17 and #18, the DL DPCH power update occurs at the
beginning of each slot. In case of slot formats #19 and #20, the DL DPCH power
update starts at the TPC field which is located at end of each slot.
### 4.2.3 DL ACK indication for UL Frame Early Termination (FET)
#### 4.2.3.1 Option 1: ACK as part of DL DPCCH
As a result of the DL enhancement of pilot-free slot-format, the DL DPCCH only
carries TPC bits. A new field could be introduced in the DL slot-format to
carry the Ack. This would increase the code-rate on the DTCH, but avoid having
to reserve an OVSF code for the ACK channel. Alternatively, the ACK could be
I-Q multiplexed with the TPC symbols, since the TPC symbols always have
identical I and Q bits. In either case, the choice of modulation scheme for
the ACK symbol -- BPSK or on-off keying -- should be investigated, based on
the achieved UL FET statistics and the ACK power required in each case. The
ACK transmit power is computed by applying a configurable offset to the DPDCH
power, similar to the currently configured DPCCH/DPDCH power offsets. If a
separate field is introduced in the DL slot format for ACK channel, then the
choice of the width of this field must be studied. A longer ACK duration
increases the ACK delay, which erodes the gains from UL FET, and also
increases the impact on the code rate of DL DTCH, which could affect DL link
efficiency. On the other hand, a shorter ACK duration could necessitate the
use of unacceptably large ACK power offsets.
#### 4.2.3.2 Option 2: ACK on a new code channel
This design option is similar to the current E-HICH design. A new code channel
carries ACKs for multiple users, distinguished by orthogonal signature
sequences. This avoids impact to DL DTCH code rate that results from TDM-ing
the ACK with TPC on the DL DPCCH, at the cost of an extra code channel, which
is however shared among multiple users. The current E-HICH spans 2ms or 8ms
duration depending on the E-DPDCH TTI. However, the E-DPDCH HARQ structure
allows the E-HICH to be transmitted in the intervals between successive HARQ
transmissions, whereas there are no such intervals on the UL DPDCH. Hence, a
longer duration ACK increases the ACK delay and lowers the link gains from UL
FET, thus even 2ms ACK duration may be unacceptably long. Thus, alternatives
such as a 1-slot or 2-slot ACK could be considered. It is also possible to
consider shorter ACKs, for example, a half-slot ACK, that would use a new set
of 20 orthogonal signature sequences instead of the current 40 sequences used
by E-HICH and E-RGCH. This channel could still support 40 users, TDM-ed across
the first and second half of each slot.
#### 4.2.3.3 Option 3: ACK using spared TPC symbols
To realize early termination, early termination indicator (ETI) is required.
In case of 750Hz Transmit Power Control (TPC) rate, the spared TPC symbols are
used to transmit ETI. Figure 4.2.3.3-1 illustrates an example of how the ETI
feedback works for UL data transmission. In this example, BS collects data
slot 0 to slot 10, performs TFCI-based or BTFD-based ET procedure. Once the
data is successfully decoded, a positive ETI is sent in DL DPCCH in slot 13 to
inform UE that UL data can be terminated. Otherwise, a negative ETI is sent in
DL DPCCH in slot 13 to inform UE. The ETIs can be sent every two slots in DL
DPCCH from slot 1 to slot 29. An ETI feedback mask can also be defined to
indicate which slots ETI can be sent in. For example, a feedback mask
[13:2:29] means ETIs can be sent every two slots in slot 13 to slot 29, and
the corresponding early decoding attempts occur every two slots starting from
slot 10 to slot 26.

Figure 4.2.3.3-1: Example of ETI feedback for UL data transmission based on
750Hz TPC rate
In case of dynamic TPC Rate i.e., TPC symbols are only replaced by ETI
according to the defined ETI feedback mask, the TPC rate will not be constant.
As shown in Figure 4.2.3.3-2, the ETI feedback mask is [13:2:29], and there is
one period with TPC rate 1500Hz and the other one period with TPC rate 750Hz.

### 4.2.4 DPCH Time Domain Multiplexing (TDM)
#### 4.2.4.1 Option 1: TDM at TTI Level
A key aspect of the study item is frame early termination, which provides both
link-efficiency and battery life improvements. An important enhancement to
enable these gains on the downlink is the design in which two users are time-
division multiplexed onto a single channelization code. This allows for
transmitting a packet over a shorter time period, which combined with the
uplink enhancements, results in significantly shorter active transmission
periods, thus, less inter- and intra- cell interference due to concurrent
active transmissions. Figure 4.2.4.1-1 shows user pairing in DL using new DL
DPCH slot formats. Here, pairs of slot formats are used to DTX one user while
the other user performs full transmission, in alternate turns. The TPC symbols
for the two users are TDM-ed in each slot.\ This allows TPC to be continuously
sent to each user, while DPDCH is only sent in alternate 10ms radio frames.\
The reduction of TTI for voice packets from 20ms to 10ms is achieved by
halving of the Spreading Factor (SF) used in R99, thus preventing excessive
puncturing that would result if the same spreading factor was used. However,
overall code-space utilization is kept unchanged since two voice UEs share
each OVSF code. Table 4.2.4.1-1 shows the new slot-formats 17 through 20 thus
created to serve as an enhanced replacement for the current slot-format 2,
achieving both the goals of pilot-free slot format and TDM-ing of two users on
a single OVSF code. In Figure 4.2.4.1-1, UE1 uses slot-format 17 in the first
10ms and slot-format 18 in the next one, while UE2 uses slot-format 20 in the
first 10ms and slot-format 19 in the next one. The halving of the SF also
halves the DCCH TTI from 40ms to 20ms. Each DCCH packet is multiplexed with
two consecutive DTCH packets which are transmitted in two 10ms frames
separated by a 10ms DPDCH transmission gap, as explained in Figure 4.2.4.1-2.
The new slot-formats 21 through 24 in Table 4.2.4.1-1 are designed to serve as
an enhanced replacement for the current slot-format 8, just as slot-formats 17

Figure 4.2.4.1-2: Multiplexing of DTCH and DCCH for two UEs sharing a single
channelization code
#### 4.2.4.2 Option 2: TDM at slot level
Technologies such as Receive Diversity (RxD), interference cancellation, and
the DCH enhancements mentioned thus far have been proved to significantly
reduce the required transmit power and allow base station to support more and
more active users simultaneously. However, the maximum number of supported
users per cell is also constrained by the channelization (OVSF) code resource.
In current specification, one user occupies one OVSF code, and with the
maximum spreading factor (SF) of 256 the maximum number of CS voice users per
scrambling code is 256 (not considering control channels, HSPA services and
other 3G services). In reality, for the sake of smaller power allocation,
spreading factor 128 is the most common setting for AMR+DCCH applications,
which means an even tighter constraint on the cell capacity(i.e. less than 128
users per cell).
The use of secondary scrambling code is one remedy in the current
specification to address the above issue. However, due to non-orthogonality
between the two scrambling codes, huge interference is introduced between
users on primary scrambling code and secondary scrambling code.
Assuming all channelization codes can be used for voice transmission, the
effective number of CS voice users per scrambling code is 128 (128 codes x 1
user/code) when SF128 is used. However, if one SF64 code is shared by 3 users,
the number of effective users becomes 192 (64 codes x 3 users/code), which
means one scrambling code can support 192 users without loss of OVSF code
orthogonality. The code rate loss is roughly 3/(128/64) = 1.5 ≈1.76dB, which
can be compensated by removing the dedicated pilot fields. Although the
opportunity of data transmission for one user is now once per 3 slots, the
control part can still be transmitted at each slot to guarantee a smooth
uplink control. The concept of time-slot division for 3 users is illustrated
in Figure 4.2.4.2-1.
{width="5.540972222222222in" height="1.0944444444444446in"}
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: Illustration of time-slot division for 3 users in 1
channelization code with SF=64
In reality, control channels also occupy the channelization code resource.
Assuming one SF16 code is reserved for the common control channels, for legacy
system the effective number of CS voice users per scrambling code now becomes
128 -8 = 120 (assuming no HSPA users). With TDM, the number of effective users
becomes 120x3/2=180.
When considering HSDPA service as well and assuming 10 SF16 codes are reserved
for HSDPA users, for legacy system the effective number of CS voice users per
scrambling code becomes at most 40. With TDM the number of maximum effective
users can increase to 40x3/2 = 60 users.
New DL DPCH slot formats are proposed to facilitate DPCH TDM as shown in Table
4.2.4.2-1 and Figure 4.2.4.2-2.

### 4.2.5 Considerations of frame timing for DPCH Time Domain Multiplexing
solutions
#### 4.2.5.1 Background
The DL timing for a user can be one out of 150 positions relative to the frame
timing, as shown in Figure 4.2.5-1.

For a user changing from one cell to the other the DL timing as well as the UL
timing of the previous cell will be inherited in the new cell, as shown in
Figure 4.2.5-2.

1 to cell 2
#### 4.2.5.2 Pairing of users
In user pairing as proposed in clause 4.2.4.1 or clause 4.2.4.2, two or three
users may be using the same DCH spreading code. This operation is transparent
to the users, as they are configured by the RNC to use certain TF and are not
aware of the paired user. The RNC is responsible for establishing paired
users, and giving paired users the same frame timing. An obvious approach for
the RNC to find pairable users is to configure only new users entering
CELL_DCH state with a timing which is fitting an already active unpaired user.
Another approach would be to perform a radio bearer reconfiguration for an
already active user. The latter solution is considered to be impractical,
given the associated signalling overhead for the network and the impact on
user experience because of user-plane interruptions.
In the following, a quantitative analysis of the possibility to execute
pairing of frame-timings is provided. The analysis is carried out for pairing
of two and of three users. A pessimistic scenario where the RNC has no
possibility to choose frame timings is examined first. The second scenario
provides for more realism by showing the possibilities when users are emerging
in a cell and can be given suitable frame timings by the RNC.
##### 4.2.5.2.1 Pairing of long-lived users
Assuming that all users in a cell have entered the cell by way of HO with
random timing, the amount of users that can be paired or remain unpaired is
shown in Figure 4.2.5-3. As in this scenario no new calls are placed that
allow the RNC to choose an arbitrary frame timing, the ability of the RNC to
create user pairings is limited to the cases where two UEs happen to have the
same timing.

Figure 4.2.5-3: Number of paired and unpaired users.\ Up to two users are
paired
It can be see that for e.g. 50 concurrent voice users only 6-7 pairs can be
formed, while 37 users remain unpaired, leading to a wastage of half as many
SF128 codes. The corresponding amount of lost SF 16 codes compared to perfect
pairing is shown in Figure 4.2.5-4.
{width="3.3625in" height="2.9006944444444445in"}
Figure 4.2.5-4: Number of SF16 codes lost because of imperfect pairing\
(pairing of up to two users was considered)
##### 4.2.5.2.2 Pairing of short-lived users
The amount of unpaired users is lower but still significant when considering a
scenario where users emerge in the system, and are given frame timings
matching those of yet unpaired users. In that situation users may remain
unpaired, because there are an odd number of users in the system. They also
may remain unpaired, because a certain percentage of users have moved into the
cell from outside. The actual amount of users remaining unpaired then is shown
in Figure 4.2.5-5a. For the simulation carried out an assumption was made that
25% or 50% of all users are HO users and hence could not be assigned a desired
frame timing, but were given random timing. After providing those HO users
with their timing, pairing was performed when still possible.

height="2.873611111111111in"}
NOTE: Up to two users may share one code.\ The lifetime of a user is assumed
to be 2min here, while the user inter-arrival time is controlling the mean
amount of users in the system.

The same analysis for up to three users on one code is shown in Figure
4.2.5-5b.
{width="3.3027777777777776in"

height="2.8229166666666665in"}
NOTE: Up to three users share one code**.**
Figure 4.2.5-5b: Number of paired and unpaired users for bursty traffic
It can be seen that a large portion of users is not able to be fit into the
code sharing. The impact on system capacity of those unpaired users can be
further illustrated by displaying the amount of free SF16 codes after pairing
is performed. One SF16 code may carry close to 10% of the cell\'s DL
throughput.
For the evaluation it was assumed that a R99 voice user consumes one SF128
code, while for pairing, one code allocation consumes a SF64 code. Figure
4.2.5-6a shows the amount of free codes for a HO percentage of 25%. Perfect
pairing (which would require radio bearer reconfigurations) has the same
performance as R99 for up to two users sharing the same code, as is expected,
and for sharing of up to three users per code improves availability of SF16
codes, compared to R99, also as expected. However when considering the pairs
that can be formed without radio bearer reconfiguration, according to Figures
4.2.5-5a and 4.2.5-5b, for TDM of two users one or more SF16 codes is lost,
while TDM of three users just matches R99 performance.

pairing leads to a loss of one SF16 code, see Figure 4.2.5-6b.

#### 4.2.5.3 Pairing of traversing users
As users are maintaining their timing while traversing through cells, the
operation of pairing may lead to a \"timing contagion\" in the network, or
pairing may not be performed at the price of reduced codespace.
The effect of timing contagion can be best explained by an example:
Assume two users A and B are paired in a cell 1. User A may enter SHO with
cell 2, while user B may enter SHO with cell 3. In case a user C in cell 2
happens to have the same tau as A, they may be paired. Otherwise the RNC will
need to wait for a new user D to appear in cell 2 to be paired with A, shown
in Figure 4.2.5-7. Now users D, A, B all have the same timing and may move
further to new cells.
{width="3.779861111111111in" height="2.6333333333333333in"}
Figure 4.2.5-7: Pairing in SHO with legacy timing
From above example we observe not only that timing contagion -- after some
time all users in the network may have the same timing -- is a real
possibility, but also that a pairing partner of a traversing user may not be
available, leading to codespace shortage or to expensive RBR reconfigurations.
Timing contagion can be avoided by not pairing users entering a cell as part
of a HO with new users. The penalty for doing so is the reduced available code
space, further degrading the already impaired situation as described in above
clause.
#### 4.2.5.4 Pairing with extended soft combining window
A solution to the availability of pairing partners is to extend the soft
combining window. This allows the RNC to assign the UE a timing of its own
choosing when the UE ventures into a new cell. Then the RNC can choose a
timing that is suitable to already present users. As an example, in Figure
4.2.5-8 UE A is given a different timing in cell 2 to allow it being paired
with UE D.
{width="3.7284722222222224in" height="2.9069444444444446in"}
> NOTE: UE A can be paired with any available UE in cell 2
Figure 4.2.5-8: pairing in SHO with extended SHO combining period
Thus, with a Soft combining window of 15 slots at the UE greatly reduced
pairing complexity is available to the network, at no signalling cost, and at
100% pairing efficiency.
##### 4.2.5.4.1 Effect of extended soft combining window on UE battery saving
From a DL interference perspective there is little difference between
synchronized DL SHO links, and DL SHO links that are delayed by a considerable
amount, because the repetitive decoding attempts will succeed as soon as
enough energy has been gathered by the UE, regardless of whether the energy
was gathered on synchronized links or not.
It can be argued that an extended SHO window will negatively impact the DRX
battery savings of the otherwise time multiplexed radio frame structure of
enhanced R99. This is true, and on average of 50% reduction of the DRX cycle
can be expected for about 25% of UEs in SHO, depending on the network
parameterization. However, it needs to be kept in mind that without user
pairing at high loads the capacity is halved, as the amount of users is
limited by the availability of spreading codes. Hence, the alternative to
imposing a slight reduction in DRX cycle length (where nevertheless FET is
still available) is to impose a DRX cycle of 100% for some users -- not
letting them connect at all because of code shortage.
The design puts most requirements on the UE, even though the extended buffer
requirements are mild as only despread symbols need to be stored.
##### 4.2.5.4.2 Effect of extended soft combining window on delay budget
The soft combining has no real impact on the voice delay budget since the
proposed time extension always falls within the allotted delay budget for a
voice service.
##### 4.2.5.4.3 Effect on UL timing
In general the UL timing is synchronous to the DL. In legacy systems, when a
UE is traversing cells as the DL timing remains constant, so does the UL
timing.
With the proposed extended SHO the UE will assume a new DL timing after it has
entered a new cell and is exiting SHO. This means that the UL timing needs to
be adjusted, e.g. when the UE is exiting SHO or dropping the link that was the
reference for the UL. An impact on higher layers can be avoided as also here
the allotted delay budget for voice services is larger than the UL timing
shifts.
#### 4.2.5.5 Conclusion on user paring
Pairing of users in enhanced R99 is plagued with availability of suitable
pairing partners, leading to reduction of overall capacity because of reduced
code space availability.
A solution is to extend the soft combining window. This allows the RNC to
assign the UE a timing of its own choosing when the UE ventures into a new
cell. Then the RNC can choose a timing that is suitable to already present
users. Thus, greatly reduced pairing complexity is available to the network,
at no signalling cost, and at 100% pairing efficiency.
While the UE thus receives DL transmission of two timings, it will maintain
the UL timing in relation to the oldest active DL timing.
### 4.2.6 Code-space and UE power efficient Signalling Radio Bearer (SRB)
design
One of the motivating factors for the proposals on enhancements to legacy R99
DCH design is the introduction of power savings at the UE, made possible by
techniques of FET and user pairing. For user pairing, two users will be time-
multiplexed onto the same code resources, shortening transmission intervals to
individual users. Another quoted benefit inherent to DCH and available to
enhanced R99 is its robustness in HO situations, and hence its importance to
the transmission of Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs).
However, in the proposal of enhanced R99 described in **R1-123809** [5], FET
is not applicable when SRBs are also multiplexed into the data transmissions,
as explained later in this document. A somewhat different angle on bringing
enhanced R99 power savings to SRB transmissions is taken in **R1-130513** [6]
where a proposal was made for investigating SRB-only DCH. Another overview of
the options to transmit SRBs efficiently especially for voice services is
provided in **R1-131606** [7].
Consequently we propose to introduce an SRB design that is power efficient,
inherits DCH robustness, and is applicable and beneficial to both enhanced R99
channels and HSDPA.
#### 4.2.6.1 Shared DCH for SRB
Long lasting battery life is an important aspect in user experience, and in
turn designs that enable power savings at the UE are very sought after.
Classic DCH design involves continuous transmission by the cell to the UE,
whereas in time-multiplexed schemes the UE is required to listen only at
defined instances, and hence can switch of receiver circuitry otherwise.
For the enhanced R99 proposal the user-pairing time-multiplexed design of
voice data transmissions presented in **R1‑123809** [5] has been motivated by
the possibility to allow switching off the UE every other TTI.
In a straightforward extension of this approach we propose to time-multiplex
different users\' SRB transmissions onto one code resource shared by these
users. Then infrequent SRB data can be statistically multiplexed, allowing for
higher burst rates and UE DRX savings without affecting code space
availability.
This newly designed physical channel for SRBs, the so-called shared DCH
(S-DCH), shared by a number of users, would be applicable to any UMTS system
and service and not limited to voice service alone. It could be applied to
enhanced R99 proposals, as well as any traffic delivered utilizing HSPA radio.
##### 4.2.6.1.1 SRB on DCH design as used since R99
In UMTS, SRBs carried over DCH are taking a format described in clause
5.10.2.4.1.2.2.1.1 of **3GPP TS 34.108** [8]: SRB data is carried over the
logical channel DCCH, which is multiplexed with the DTCH in the transport
channel DPCH. The DPCH is the mapped onto the physical channel DPDCH. The
format of the multiplexing is illustrated in Figure 4.2.6-1.
{width="5.594444444444444in" height="3.2069444444444444in"}
Figure 4.2.6-1: R99 DL DPCH construction for 12.2kbps speech\ [(adapted from
Fig. A.5 in **3GPP TS 25.101** [9])
For SRBs transported on DCH, the existing RLC/MAC structures always provide
148-bit transport blocks (see Figure 4.2.6-1, right side) for L1 processing.
After channel coding the transport block\'s 516 bits are fed to rate
matching.\ The slot format design for the radio frames in the example is
specified as shown in Table 4.2.6-1.

* * *
That is, every slot carries a certain amount DPDCH data, all slots being the
same.
##### 4.2.6.1.2 Shared DCH design
In this design, it is proposed to introduce a new physical channel for
carrying the DCCH, the _shared DCH_ channel.\ For this new channel radio
frames are composed of two possible slot formats: The first carries a UE
identifier and data while all other slots carry only data. A UE ID in the
first slot allows UEs which are not addressed to DRX for the rest of the
frame. Power control information can be carried either in F-DPCH channels, or
in enhanced R99 channels. TFCI information may not be necessary as there is
only one valid TB size for the SRB.

Figure 4.2.6-3: New proposed shared DCH:\ slot format for all other slots of
the radio frame
As an example one may consider a UE which is configured in the downlink
direction with voice user data mapped to HSDPA, and with SRBs mapped to the
shared DCH described above. The shared DCH slot formats allow carrying more
data than the presently defined formats for DCH carrying SRB and voice. This
means that SRB can be delivered much faster, thus significantly improving
latency (traditional SRB over DCH data rate is 3.4 kbps and the TTI is 40 ms,
i.e. a transport block is split over 4 radio frames, the transmission can
start once per 40 ms and the transmission duration is 40 ms, see Figure
4.2.6-1). In addition, the RNC can allocate more time on the S-DCH for users
with high signalling need (during mobility procedures, for example), if
needed, such that longer SRB payloads can be delivered in a timely manner.
Table 4.2.6-2 shows the preferred spreading factor and TTI length combinations
that can be used for radio frames. Other possible combinations are shown in
Table 4.2.6-3. The 148-bit transport block after encoding and rate matching
could be fitted to less than 200 bits, but it may be desirable to use at least
close to 400 bits to ensure good coding protection. The most attractive
combinations would use 10 ms TTI for best latency and thus the most attractive
combinations are SF128 and SF256 with 10 ms TTI, but the SF256 suffers from
reduced coding protection.

Using a combination of slot formats 25 and 26 to transmit an SRB transport
block, L1 processing will then dispose of 588 encoded SRB data bits and 12
UE_ID bits. Rate matching will then be adapted to provide these 588 bits, thus
resulting in additional protection. This is shown in Figure 4.2.6-4.

##### 4.2.6.1.2.1 Performance considerations of the S-DCH design
{#performance-considerations-of-the-s-dch-design .H6}
In Figure 4.2.6-5, a comparison of forward error correction codes applied for
data and UE ID fields of S-DCH channel in case of the UE ID field (12, 3) code
is shown. The (12, 3) code used is shown in Table 4.2.6-5.

Figure 4.2.6-5: Comparison of Forward Error Correction codes applied for data\
and UE_ID fields of S-DCH channel in case of UE_ID field (12, 3) code
A FEC code gain for BLER = 0.01 is visible for the DCCH (data) field with
respect to the UE ID field. Its value is approximately equal to 1 dB. This
means that for equal BLER performance the UE-ID field should be power-boosted
by 1 dB. Alternatively, the UE-ID field could be extended (and the data field
shortened) for better coding protection at equal power as the data field.
Studies show that it is possible to use the full first slot for the UE-ID and
only the remaining 14 slots for data, without really affecting the BLER for
the data.
##### 4.2.6.1.3 Shared DCH for HSPA
When mapping SRBs to DCH while data is transported by HSPA channels, the
system\'s architecture is shown in Figure 4.2.6-6.
{width="5.615972222222222in" height="2.1354166666666665in"}
Figure 4.2.6-6: System architecture when configuring HSDPA with SRBs on S-DCH
It is noted that the S-DCH could be introduced also formally as a new
transport or physical channel.
##### 4.2.6.1.4 Shared DCH for HSPA with CPC
In Rel-7 discontinuous reception and transmission (DRX and DTX) was introduced
as part of the CPC package.\ The benefits as reported in 3GPP TR 25.903 [10]
lie in the reduced UE battery consumption and larger system capacity. DRX/DTX
and circuit switched always-on DCH are mutually exclusive. The shared DCH
however can be easily combined with DRX and DTX.
Recall that as laid out in **3GPP TS 25.214** [11], clause 6C, in DRX the UE
needs to monitor only every n-th subframe the HS-SCCH and a few other channels
in order to detect new transmissions and keep track of the active set (see
clause 6C.3 in **3GPP TS 25.214** [11]). The DRX duty cycle is configured by
the RNC, even though the Node-B may de-activate DRX usage by means of HS-SCCH
orders.
For transmitting the SRBs on S-DCH while DRX is enabled we note that the RNC
is already aware of the DRX duty cycles and simply needs to address the UE
only when it is listening. Likewise, the UE also needs to decode the S-DCH
when awake.
##### 4.2.6.1.5 Shared DCH for enhanced R99
For the proposed enhanced R99 design as show in Figure 4.2.6-7, DPDCH FET
cannot be carried out in all cases if SRB data is present. The reason is that
DTCH and DCCH (which carries the SRB) are interleaved in the DPDCH:
Terminating the DPDCH transmission would also leave DCCH bits untransmitted.
Thus terminating the DPDCH with FET can be done only if also DCCH has been
successfully received as well. This is the background of the proposal of [5]
to introduce in-band signalling of the presence of the DCCH.
{width="6.686805555555556in" height="2.801388888888889in"}
Figure 4.2.6-7: User pairing on the Downlink using new DL DPCH slot formats
The benefit of the new shared DCH is thus not only in bringing time
multiplexing battery savings for DCH based SRBs, but also in that it frees the
enhanced R99 DPCH from the need to carry SRB data. Then in-band signalling for
the presence of the DCCH can be omitted, and FET can be applied consistently.
When using this configuration, the system\'s architecture is shown in Figure
4.2.6-8.

# 5 MAC layer eEnhancements
No enhancements to MAC layer were proposed for study.
# 6 UE power consumption efficiency
The proposed enhancements to DCH provide significant opportunity to gate the
modem transceiver and thus improve UE power consumption. The gating
opportunity is a consequence of the design of DCH channels on the UL and DL,
in a way that UL transmission can be terminated earlier through FET and DL
transmission completes faster due to shorter TTI and also FET.
Table 6-1 shows the average percentage of time the UE could potentially shut
off its transceiver in Solution 1 and Solution 3. The OLPC target in Solution
1 is set to be at slot 15 with BLER target of 15% and 1%, in UL and DL,
respectively. In Solution 3, the OLPC target is set to be at slot 30 in DL
with BLER target of 1%, and slot 15 in UL with BLER target of 15. As can be
seen in this analysis, in Solution 1, the UE can shut off its transceiver
about 63% of the time. In Solution 3, the UE gating opportunity reduces to
34%. The reduction of gating opportunity in Solution 3 is due to increased TTI
duration in DL transmission in this solution to 20ms, as compared to 10ms in
Solution 1.\ The trade-off is that Solution 3 in comparison to Solution 1
shows relatively improved performance in DL, at the expense of increased power
consumption on the UE side. In both solutions however, a significant
improvement can be achieved in power consumption due to gating of UE
transceiver.

+---------+--------------------+--------------------+ | Channel | Average UE Modem | Average UE Modem | | | | | | | Gating Opportunity | Gating Opportunity | | | | | | | -- Solution 1 | -- Solution 3 | +---------+--------------------+--------------------+ | PA3 | 63.12% | 34.85% | +---------+--------------------+--------------------+ | PB3 | 63.13% | 34.85% | +---------+--------------------+--------------------+ | VA30 | 63.92% | 35.16% | +---------+--------------------+--------------------+ | VA120 | 62.29% | 32.85% | +---------+--------------------+--------------------+
Table 6-2 gives the estimated UE gating performance analysis for Solution 4,
with OLPC target set at slot 30 and BLER target of 1%, in both UL and DL. As
can be seen in this table, averaged across all channels and packet types with
50% voice, the overall average UE gating in Solution 4 is obtained to be
40.3%.

# 7 Voice over HSPA (VoHSPA)
## 7.1 General overview of CS VoHSPA {#general-overview-of-cs-vohspa .list-
paragraph}
In VoHSPA, a feature available as part of Rel-7, CS voice services are made
available on top of packet-switched HSPA. The ability to share the same
resources with PS data traffic and the greater link efficiency of HSDPA
compared to R99 then directly translates to increased voice user capacity in
the downlink.
The basic operation of VoHSPA only requires (in addition to HSDPA and HSUPA) a
de-jitter buffer in the RNC and UE. In addition, a number of HSPA-related
techniques can be applied to guarantee mobility robustness, and benefit from
battery saving and capacity gains with VoHSPA:
  * CPC (DTX, DRX) (reducing interference in the uplink, saving UE battery time)
  * Enhanced F-DPCH (removal of code limitations)
  * SRB over HS & E-UL (advantages of HSPA also for SRB)
  * HS-SCCH less operation (control overhead for small packets)
  * Enhanced Serving Cell Change (eSCC), (faster and more robust HO)
  * QoS Aware Scheduler
  * Bi-Casting (shorter voice interruption at times of serving cell change)
  * RLC Duplicate Packet Detection for RLC UM (enabling the implementation of bi-casting in the UTRAN)
  * Dynamic transition to 10ms TTI in the uplink (enhancing coverage)
To meet the stringent requirements of voice services and to ensure robustness,
advanced UE receivers are required for VoHSPA. However, UE receiver
performance improvements defined and implemented for HSDPA traffic can also be
used for voice services when voice is delivered with HSDPA radio.
## 7.2 VoHSPA details
### 7.2.1 Serving Cell Change (SCC), enhanced SCC, and Node-B-terminated
bicasting
Some concerns have been expressed on CS VoHSPA potentially presenting
reliability problems for call maintenance during Serving Cell Change (SCC)
procedure. In \"Enhanced HSDPA Mobility Performance: Quality and Robustness
for VoIP Service\", Qualcomm Inc. [3], it is shown that robustness issues
during SCC may arise in extreme mobility scenarios, such as urban canyon
(Manhattan grid).
In extreme radio conditions where the serving link deteriorates very fast the
user plane connectivity may be affected as the link adaptation may not react
fast enough to maintain the target BLER, or because of the interruption in
link connectivity that may occur during a SCC. In the worst case the link will
deteriorate so fast that the RNC can no longer communicate to the UE a new
target cell via RRC messages over the original link as part of the SCC. Thus,
in the above described scenario there is a higher risk of voice interruptions
or call drops.
One approach to tackle these two issues of call drop and user plane
interruption is to fine-tune the parameters to accelerate the execution of the
SCC procedure. In this case, a trade-off can be observed: If the network is
parameterized to react to rapidly-changing channel conditions, it will be able
to cope with the degradation of the CPICH Ec/No of the serving cell in urban
canyon environments. However, in macro cell environments, there will be an
increased risk of a ping-pong handover effect.
Alternatively, the network can perform an enhanced serving cell change (eSCC),
which has been standardized in Rel-8 and is described in **3GPP TS 25.308**
[12]. The eSCC procedure features the concept of target cell pre-
configuration, which adds robustness to the HS-DSCH SCC procedure by allowing
the network to send the HS-DSCH SCC command over the source cell as an RRC
message and/or over the target cell as an HS-SCCH order.
Yet another technique to reduce the amount of lost packets is to bicast the
voice packets from the RNC to the source and target cells during the SCC
procedure. With bicasting the UE will still receive the packets only from one
cell at a time, but the availability of the data immediately prior to the
switch in the source cell and immediately after the switch in the target cell
is ensured.
As shown in \"Enhanced HSDPA Mobility Performance: Quality and Robustness for
VoIP Service\", Qualcomm Inc. [3], the above approaches and their combination
lead to almost gapless and error-free voice connectivity during a serving cell
change.
### 7.2.2 Mobility
The DCH enhancements discussed in clause 4 are intended to build on the well-
established Voice over DCH technology. The main advantage is an increased
capacity whilst maintaining the robustness advantages of soft handover.
For HSPA, there are a number of ways to address the robustness in mobility to
achieve a near-error free performance.
In addition to the established and well researched techniques, the
introduction of Multiflow has opened the door to bringing even larger
robustness for voice services as shown in [13]:
**Call drop:** With Multiflow+SRB, the concept of the Serving Cell Change
(SCC) involves only reconfiguring already established links. Hence, a call
drop can be made very improbable, just as in R99 SHO. Bicasting can also be
applied for SRBs with Multiflow as well.
**User plane connectivity:** In Multiflow, a large number of options exist to
manage user plane connectivity during SCC, e.g.:
  * plain Multiflow RNC-based selection of the better link,
  * active buffer management of the cells when one link becomes unavailable,
  * Node-B- or UE-terminated bicasting,
  * hybrid versions of the above.
It is possible to bring about a \"graceful handover\" of an active voice
connection. At first, a Multiflow link is established to the target, but data
continues to be routed only over the source. Eventually, the voice data will
be bicasted through both links, and finally only through the target. Such an
approach allows for a way to balance robustness versus link efficiency.
### 7.2.3 Capacity
Voice over HSPA (VoHSPA ) capacity was evaluated in the Rel-7 \"Continuous
Connectivity for Packet Data Users\" study item, from which the uplink DTX,
downlink DRX, new DL slot format and HS-SCCH less HSDPA transmission were
adopted to Rel-7 specifications. The evaluation results are documented in 3GPP
TR 25.903 [10] clauses 4.2.2.4.4 and 4.8.2.3 respectively for uplink and
downlink.

Inactive state, SID packets are generated with SID packet being generated once
every 160 ms. The transition probability between the two Active and Inactive
states is shown in Table 8.1.10.

### 8.2.1 Link simulation assumptions for voice over R99 DCH
#### 8.2.1.1 Link simulation assumptions for Downlink voice over R99 DCH
The link simulation settings for downlink are shown in Table 8.2-1. Each
simulation consists of transmissions of a payload whose bits are generated
randomly at each TTI but whose size (TBS) is fixed over the entire simulation.
The possible TBSs and their encoding details for AMR 12.2kbps and 5.9kbps
codecs are shown in Table 8.2-3.

**NOTE 1:** Negative number indicates repetition. Definition of Npunc is
illustrated in Figure 8.2-1. Its value depends on rate-matching attributes.
**NOTE 2:** Rate matching attributes are listed in the order (DTCH-A, DTCH-B,
DTCH-C, DCCH) for AMR12.2kbps, and in the order  
(DTCH-A,DTCH-B,DCCH) for AMR 5.9kbps codec. For both codecs, the DCCH is
configured for 40ms TTI with TBS=148, Ncrc=16 and  
convolutional encoding with rate 1/3.  
Even though DCCH is not transmitted, these parameters are required to
determine the rate-matching pattern for the packets that are transmitted.
**NOTE 3:** Packet frequencies are used as weights to average the TxEc/Ior
values obtained from simulations for each packet type, to obtain an overall  
TxEc/Ior for the given vocoder and air-interface. The frequencies in Table
8.1.3 correspond to 50% voice activity factor.  
The Full-A,B,C packet types for AMR vocoder are all transmitted together, and hence have the same frequency. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

AMR is modeled based on a two stage Markov model with two Active and Inactive
states, where in the Active state, only Full packets are generated, and in the
Inactive state, SID and NULL packets are generated with SID packet being sent
after every 7 NULL packets. The transition probability between the two Active
and Inactive states is shown in Table 8.1.10. The AMR Markov model described
above is used for both uplink and downlink.

##### 8.2.3.1.3 Simplified simulation methodology for HSDPA throughput from
voice-only simulation
A simplified simulation methodology may also be used in order to evaluate
HSDPA data throughput by modeling only voice users in the system simulations.
This is done by estimating the data throughput as a function of the power and
number of codes available for HSDPA after accounting for the power and codes
used by the overhead channels and by the circuit-switched voice UEs. This
methodology is described as follows:
The radio resources shared by CS voice and HSDPA data include both transmit
power and OVSF codes. In system simulations, the set of OVSF codes used by CS
voice users is determined once the active set for each user is computed. Power
used by each CS voice user is determined by inner/outer loop power control
which maintains voice quality.\ When CS voice and HSDPA data coexist, the QoS
of CS voice has a priority over HSDPA data. Hence available power and OVSF
code of HSDPA data is then determined after the allocation of CS voice power
and code.
In this simplified model, we use the following steps in modelling HSDPA
throughput, where only CS voice needs to be simulated in system simulation
  * **Step 1:** Fix DL Node-B transmit power to the maximum as P~max~
  * **Step 2:** Running CS voice only in a system simulation, compute the averaged OVSF code C~voice~ and average DL voice power P~voice~ per cell as follows
> C~voice~ = ∑~n~ C(n)/N, P~voice~ = ∑~n~ P(n)/N
>
> where n is the cell index, N is the total number of cells, the summations
> run over all cells in the simulation, and C(n), P(n) are respectively the
> number of OVSF codes (in units of SF512) and transmit power used by voice
> users in cell n.
  * **Step 3:** Calculate available SF16 OVSF code and power for HSDPA as
> C~hs~ = └(512-C~comm~ -- C~voice~)/32 ┘ , P~hs~ = P~max~ -- P~comm~ --
> P~voice~
>
> where C~comm~ =24 and P~comm~= 0.2 P~max~ are respectively the OVSF code and
> power used for common channels.
>
> Then using C~hs~ and P~hs~ as the index, interpolate the HSDPA power vs.
> code vs. throughput tables shown in Tables 8.2-7A and 8.2-7B to get the
> corresponding HSDPA throughput. These tables are also displayed as mapping
> curves in Figures 8.2-3, 8.2-4.
Note that power compression for CS voice users is needed whenever the total
power of voice users exceeds the upper bound of Node-B transmit power.
Considering the slot averaged power from all voice users is P~voice~ , and the
maximum transmit power of Node-B is P~max~ , thus P~comp~ =P~max~ - P~voice~
is the power that needs to be compressed.\ Voice UEs with maximum slot
averaged power are compressed. Here we select voice UEs with maximum DL Ec/Ior
which have P~voice_max~ > P~comp~, where P~voice_max~ is the sum of the powers
of the selected voice UEs. Each UE\'s power is then compressed with a scaling
factor (P~voice_max~ - P~comp~)/P~voice_max~.

##### 8.2.3.1.4 Link-to-system mapping for DCH
This clause describes the downlink DCH link-to-system mapping methodology to
be used for the evaluation of DCH enhancements. Similar methodology also
applies to the link-to system mapping for uplink DCH.
**_Step 1:_** Obtain the mapping curves from DPCH RX SINR to DTCH BLER from
link level simulations.
**_Step 1-1 :_** DPCH RX slot SINR calculation
$\text{dpch_slot_sinr_lin} =
\frac{\text{dpch_pwc}_{\text{sp}}}{\text{intra_cell_pwc_np} +
\text{inter_cell_pwc_np}}$ The DPCH RX slot SINR (_dpch_slot_sinr_lin_) is
calculated as follows:
$\begin{matrix} \text{dpch_pwc}_{\text{sp}} \ = \text{SF} \ast \left{ \sum_{r
= 1}^{R}{\sum_{a = 1}^{A}\left\lbrack \sqrt{\text{DPCH}_{\text{Ec}}(a)} \ast
\sum_{f = 1}^{F(a)}\left| h_{\text{avg}}(a,f,r) \right|^{2} \right\rbrack}
\right}^{2} \ \end{matrix}$ , where dpch_pwc_sp stands for power of (signal
part after PWC), which is calculated by
$\begin{matrix} \text{intra_cell_pwc_np} \ = \sum_{r = 1}^{R}{\sum_{a =
1}^{A}\left{ \hat{I}\text{or}(a) \ast \sum_{}^{F(a)}{} \middle| \middle| F(a)
\middle| \right}} \ \end{matrix}$ , intra_cell_pwc_np stands for PWCed intra-
cell interference power, which is calculated by
$\begin{matrix} \text{inter_cell_pwc_np} \ = \sum_{r =
1}^{R}\underset{C}{\sum_{}^{A}} \ \ \end{matrix}$ , inter_cell_mrc_np stands
for PWCed inter-cell interference power, which is calculated by
$\begin{matrix} r = \text{RX\ \ antenna\ index;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ t} =
\text{TX\ \ antenna\ index;} \ R = \text{#\ of\ RX\ antennas;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ T} = \text{#\ of\ TX\ antennas;} \ f = \text{finger}(\text{path})\text{\
index;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ h} = \text{channel\ impulse\ response;} \ \text{F\
} = \text{\ #\ of\ fingers;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ A} =
\text{#\ of\ active\ set\ cells;\ \ \ } \ C = \text{#\ of\ all\ cells;\ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ SF} = \text{DPCH\ spreading\ factor;\ } \
\text{a\ } = \text{\ active\ set\ cell\ index;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ c\ } =
\text{\ cell\ index\ }(\text{First\ A\ } \in \text{\ active\ set}); \ x =
\text{fader\ sample\ index;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ X} = \text{#\ of\ fader\
samples\ /\ slot} \ \text{Ioc\ } = \text{\ Thermal\ noise;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ {}\hat{I}\text{or\ } = \text{\ BS\ TX\ power\ observed\ @\ UE;} \
\end{matrix}h_{\text{avg}} = \text{Norm\&Avg\ of\ CIR;\ \ \ DPCH_Ec\ } =
\text{\ DPCH\ TX\ power\ observed\ @\ UE;}$ All these abbreviations are
defined as follows:
$h_{\text{avg}}(c,f,r) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{X} \cdot \sum_{x = 1}^{X}{\sum_{t =
1}^{T(c)}\left( \frac{\left| h(c,f,t,r,n) \right|^{2}}{T}(c) \right)}}$ and
_h~avg~(c,f,r)_ is defined as
If RX finger number is different to multipath number, corresponding
modifications are required.
**_Step 1-2 :_** DPCH RX TTI SINR calculation.
DPCH RX TTI SINR is obtained by averaging DPCH RX slot SINR across all slots
in the TTI.
**_Step 1-3 :_** Mapping curve generation
Given different channel models and different geometry, simulations are
performed to get curves that map DPCH RX SINR to DTCH BLER.
**_Step 2:_** System level simulation
For each UE, DPCH RX TTI SINR is calculated every TTI and is used to obtain
the DTCH BLER using the mapping curves generated in Step 1. The DTCH BLER is
used to determine whether the instantaneous speech block is successfully
decoded or not. Outer loop power control is simulated to adjust the target
SINR accordingly. Inner loop power control is simulated based on the simulated
TPC rate.

A simplified simulation methodology may also be used in order to evaluate
HSUPA data throughput by modeling only voice users in the system simulations.\
This is done by estimating the data throughput as a function of the fraction
of RoT available for HSDPA after accounting for the power used by the overhead
channels and by the circuit-switched voice UEs. This methodology is described
as follows:
In UL system simulation, CS voice and HSUPA data services share the load of
the cell together. With increasing number of CS voice users, load of CS voice
is also increasing which means less available load for HSUPA data users.
Assuming the load of the cell is fixed, HSUPA throughput can be calculated as
a function of available HSUPA load.\ Here a simplified way in mapping the
HSUPA throughput is provided with the following steps:
  * **Step 1:** Assume fixed Io~total~ on each cell, based on the target RoT in Table 8.2-9.
  * **Step 2:** Simulating the CS voice only case, compute the long term averaged load of CS voice as
> L~voice~ = Io~voice_mean~/Io~total~; where Io~voice_mean~ = ∑~n~
> Io~voice~(n)/N, where n is the cell index, N is the total number of cells,
> the summations run over all cells in the simulation, and Io~voice~(n) is the
> total received power from voice users in cell n.
  * **Step 3:** Calculate available load for HSUPA user by as Lhs = 1- L~voice~ -- 1/RoT, and use it to interpolate the HSUPA load vs. throughput table shown in Table 8.2-10 and Figure 8.2-5 to compute the HSUPA throughput.

#### 8.2.5.1 Link simulation assumptions for Downlink voice over enhanced DCH
##### 8.2.5.1.1 Pilot-free DPCCH slot formats
The new pilot free DPCCH slot formats are listed in Table 8.2-11.
The slot formats 17-24 are used in pairs corresponding to the TDM of two users
over a 20ms period. Figure 8.2-6 illustrates the slot formats for a pair of
AMR5.9k users.\ Only one user of a pair of TDM users is evaluated in the link
simulations. Slot formats 17 and 18 are to be used for the AMR 5.9K codec, and
slot formats 21 and 22 are to be used for the AMR 12.2K codec. The DPCCH/DPDCH
power offsets used are the same as those in the baseline assumptions as
described in Table 8.2-1.\ The TTI reduction causes higher setpoints for each
UE, although average power spent by Node-B does not increase since the number
of UEs to which simultaneous transmission is required is halved. Hence, the
maximum TxEc/Ior setting for use with these slot formats can be appropriately
increased compared to that used for R99 DCH as listed in Table 8.2-1.

##### 8.2.5.1.2 DPDCH Frame Early Termination (FET)
Frame Early Termination (FET) is an enhancement in which the receiver attempts
early decoding of the packet, i.e., decoding prior to complete reception of
the packet. An ACK feedback mechanism informs the transmitter of successful
early decoding, and the transmission is terminated upon reception of the ACK.
Since the false CRC-pass rate increases due to increase in the number of early
decoding attempts, a 16 bit CRC is used for error detection (using the 16 bit
CRC polynomial defined in 3GPP TS 25.212 [4]).\ DL FET parameters are listed
in 8.2-12.

* * *
Parameter Value Channel Encoding Joint coding for AMR Class A,B,C bits Early

slots) of the transport block Early termination modelling DTX entire-DL-DPCCH

is transmitted Number of warm up slots for DPCCH 0,1 CRC Size 16, 12

The ACK feedback timeline is shown in Figure 8.2-7.
{width="6.332638888888889in" height="1.6256944444444446in"}
Figure 8.2-7: DL FET
The OLPC operation is modified to account for successful early decoding
attempts in FET. A successful early decoding event results in a reduction of
the SIR target.\ The receiver does not attempt any further decode attempts
once the frame has successfully decoded.\ The SIR target is increased if the
packet fails in all decoding attempts, including early decoding instances and
final decoding after the entire packet has been observed.
During warm up slots, only DPCCH is transmitted to assist ILPC with tracking
the channel, if necessary.
Ideal ACK decoding is assumed for simplicity. A 2 slot delay is assumed for
ACK message. The parameters pertaining to the ACK modeling are shown in Table
8.2-13.

* * *
Parameter Value Early decode ack-delay ---See Figure 8.2-7. 2 slots Early

* * *
The rate matching parameters to be used with the new slot formats are
specified in Table 8.2-14. Figure 8.2-8 shows DL bit pipeline and defines the
parameters specified in Table 8.2-14. A single transport channel is used to
carry all DTCH packets. This ensures that all bits are protected by CRC, as
opposed to the current scheme where the Full voice packet is subdivided into
separately encoded packets, some of which are not protected by the CRC. Using
the current scheme would result in higher BER for the bits that are not
protected by CRC if the packet is terminated when the bits that are protected
by CRC are early decoded.

#### 8.2.5.2 Link simulation assumptions for Uplink voice over enhanced DCH
##### 8.2.5.2.1 DPDCH Frame Early Termination (FET)
UL FET is similar to DL FET in principle; upon early decoding of data
transport channel, an ACK message is sent to terminate UL transmission. Since
false CRC pass rate increases by increasing the number of early decoding
attempts, 16 bit CRC is used for error detection. The UL FET parameters are
listed in Table 8.2-15.

Figure 8.2-9: UL FET
Warm up slots in UL DPCCH are provisioned to enhance channel tracking in
presence of FET.
In the UL, the OLPC is modified to assist FET by targeting to achieve a
certain BLER value at a particular FET attempt. The BLER value is chosen such
that the overall final BLER after all decoding attempts is less than or equal
to desired block error rate for the voice traffic, and the slot at which BLER
target is enforced may be an earlier slot in the TTI. This is shown in Figure
8.2-10, where the parameter OLPC_TARGET_SLOT specifies the location within the
entire transport block (combined repeated transport blocks) at which OLPC
targets a specified BLER. The values of OLPC_TARGET_SLOT and BLER in this
study are TBD. OLPC updates the SIR target at the Node-B whenever a successful
decoding attempt occurs for any transport channel (a CRC pass), or if decoding
fails (no CRC pass) in all decoding attempts up to, and including, the
decoding attempt happening at OLPC_TARGET_SLOT.

The ACK channel for UL FET is assumed to be ideal for the purpose of this
study for the sake of simplicity. A 2ms delay for ACK message is assumed. The
parameters pertaining to the ACK modeling are shown in Table 8.2-17.

##### 8.2.5.2.2 Uplink DTCH / DCCH compression and repetition
In the uplink, the compression and repetition of the DTCH/DTCH allows for more
efficient FET operation. This is achieved by configuring the DTCH channel with
10ms TTI, along with a repetition at the MAC layer. Figure 8.2-11 shows the UL
compression using 10ms TTI and transport block retransmission at MAC layer.

##### 8.2.5.2.3 FET-DPCCH
The FET-DPCCH is an uplink channel that carries the UL TFCI, and the ACK
information for DL FET. The first 2 slots of FET-DPCCH are allocated to TFCI
information, which is encoded using the mechanism in use for CQI encoding in
HS-DPCCH channel based on (20, 5) Reed Muller codes. The ACK information can
be sent in subsequent slots as shown in Figure 8.2-12 and is encoded in the
same way as the HARQ-ACK in the HS-DPCCH channel. TFCI information is sent at
the beginning to allow Node-B to decode UL transport block format earlier.

##### 8.2.6.1.2 Early Termination
ETI feedback error rate is assumed to be 0 for simplicity. The receiver
decoding attempts are assumed slot 2 to slot 29 within a TTI, and the early
termination indicator feedback delay is assumed 2 slots. As shown below, UE
has no successful decoding until it collects data of slot 0\~slot 9. According
to the ETI feedback procedure, Node-B terminates DPDCH after slot 12. Since ET
indicator transmission mechanism is still under discussion. To isolate the ET
performance and the ETI mechanisms, it is assumed ETI can be transmitted in
some way.

slot format
When DL and UL data transmission are both early terminated, DPCCH can be also
terminated with negligible impact to system performance. Since UL is not
simulated in DL performance simulation, Node-B is assumed to be able to stop
DPCCH transmission as long as Node-B terminates DPDCH transmission for
simplicity. The period is called ET Gap. One slot is used for power control
warm up before entering the next TTI. ET Gap is shown in the below figure.

\"E-WCDMA + TDM\" for fair comparison, otherwise there will be bias against
the other two schemes (Legacy and E-WCDMA) in terms of TPC CER. Since three
UEs share one DPCH channel in TDM, the maximum DPDCH Ec/Ior is relaxed from
-10dB to -7dB in simulation.

#### 8.2.6.2 Link simulation assumptions for Uplink voice over enhanced DCH
##### 8.2.6.2.1 TFCI based transmission
The original TFCI (10, 32) code is still applied with early decoding. The
maximum number of TFC for 12.2k services is 16, which means only 4 bits out of
10 TFCI bits are valid. When 4 bits are encoded to 32 bits, the probability of
a successful decoding before the whole 32 bits are fully collected is quite
high. Whenever Node-B tries to decode the data, it first performs early
decoding for TFCI. This is called TFCI early decoding.
##### 8.2.6.2.2 Early Termination (ET)
ETI feedback error rate is assumed to be 0 for simplicity. The receiver
decoding attempts are assumed slot 6 to slot 29 within a TTI, and the early
termination indicator feedback delay is assumed 2 slots. As shown below,
Node-B has no successful decoding until it collects data of slot 0\~slot 9.
According to the ETI feedback procedure, UE terminates DPDCH after slot 12.
Since ET indicator transmission mechanism is still under discussion. To
isolate the ET performance and the ETI mechanisms, it is assumed ETI can be
transmitted in some way.

### 8.2.7 Link Performance Evaluation Metrics for voice over enhanced DCH
Table 8.2-21 shows the metrics to be evaluated for each simulation, in order
to judge the merits of the proposed enhancements. Note that these metrics
include all the metrics described in the assumptions for baseline R99
evaluation as described in clause 8.2.2, so as to allow comparison against the
baseline, as well as additional metrics to quantify FET performance and gating
statistics. For the proposed uplink enhancement that involves a new UL TFCI
and Ack channel design, Table 8.2-22 shows the metrics to be evaluated to
capture the link performance of the new channel.

### 8.2.8 System simulation assumptions for voice over enhanced DCH (Solution
1 and 3)
The system simulation assumptions for voice over enhanced DCH are in line with
those for voice over R99, so as to enable comparison between the two. Thus,
most parts of clauses 8.2.3 and 8.2.4 also apply for voice over enhanced DCH.
The only parts that don\'t apply are certain parameter value assumptions
listed for R99 DCH in Tables 8.2-6 and 8.2-8 (eg, the DL rate-matching
attributes) which are actually identical to the corresponding values assumed
in the link simulation assumptions for R99 DCH.\ Since the corresponding link
simulation assumptions for enhanced DCH are different, this change needs to be
also reflected in the system simulation assumptions for enhanced DCH.\ These
changes are captured in Tables 8.2-23 and 8.2-24.

### 8.2.9 System simulation assumptions for voice over enhanced DCH (Solution
2 and 4)
For those system simulation assumptions, which are specific to enhanced DCH or
other than those in clause 8.2.3 and clause 8.2.4, they can be found in clause
8.2.6 \"Link Simulation Assumptions\".
# 9 Link evaluation results
## 9.1 Link evaluation results: Downlink, Solutions 1 and 3
This clause presents link evaluation of downlink DCH enhancements described as
'Solution 1\' and 'Solution 3\' in clause 8.
### 9.1.1 Additional assumptions
The maximum TxEc/Ior of non-DTXed chips is set to -10dB for R99. Since
Solution 3 uses 20ms TTI just like the existing R99, and it uses the same
value of maximum TxEc/Ior as the corresponding R99 simulation. However,
Solution 1 uses a 10ms TTI, and hence uses an increased value. The amount of
the increase is 3.76dB for AMR 12.2kbps codec and 3.35dB for AMR 5.9kbps
codec. For Solution 3, early-decoding was attempted once every 3 slots (at
slots indexed 3, 6 ... 30), so that the number of decoding attempts is similar
to that used in Solution 1.
### 9.1.2 Link efficiency of AMR 12.2kbps codec
Figures 9.1.2-1,2 show the link-efficiency for active-set sizes of 1 and 2
respectively, for R99 and Solutions 1 and 3 assuming 50% voice activity
factor. Figures 9.1.2-3,4 show the link-efficiency gains over R99 realized by
Solutions 1 and 3. In most cases, there is a gain of around 2dB from Solution
1 and around 2.6dB from Solution 2, which is fairly insensitive to geometry.
The case of PA3 channel without handover is an exception for Solution 1, which
provides lower gain in this case, which further reduces at lower geometry.
This is due to the lack of multipath diversity in the PA3 channel, together
with the loss of time-diversity and the discontinuity in inner-loop power
control inherent in Solution 1 due to the fact that the data is carried only
on alternate 10ms radio frames. Handover provides more diversity and hence
this behaviour is not seen when active-set size is 2. Figures 9.1.2-5-8 shows
the same quantities as Figures 9.1.2-1-4 respectively, but separately for
different AMR packet types. The DCH enhancements yield much more gain for the
Null packet when compared to the Full packet, since the pilot overhead is
higher for Null packet. However, the overall gain at 50% voice activity factor
is dominated more by the gain of the Full packet, since the Full packet
consumes much more power than the Null packet. The link gains are also
summarized in Table 9.1.2-1

### 9.1.3 Average decoding time and packet BLER for AMR 12.2kbps codec
Both Solutions 1 and 3 incorporate FET, and their average decoding times in
slots is shown in Figures 9.1.3-1,2 respectively for active-set size of 1,2,
when voice activity factor is 50%. Figures 9.1.3-3,4 show the decoding times
separately for each DL packet type. Since Solution 1 uses a 10ms TTI while
Solution 3 uses a 20ms TTI, the decoding time is much larger than
(approximately double) that in Solution 3. The smaller packets also decode
earlier.
As in the case of link efficiency (clause 9.1.2), the decoding time is mostly
insensitive to channel model and geometry, with the exception that Solution 1
has lower decoding time for PA3 at low geometry. This can be explained by
noting that the poor diversity may make the channel go into a very deep fade,
causing the setpoint to rise too high thus producing excess SNR that can be
exploited to enable earlier decoding. The cumulative decoding success rate
after successive early-decode attempts is shown in Figure 9.1.3-5, and also
demonstrates the same trends as a function of channel model and geometry.
The target BLER of 1% for the voice packets was achieved in all cases
simulated except for the PA3 channel in absence of soft handover for geometry
of 3dB. Even in this case, the BLER was only slightly higher, i.e. 1-1.3%
depending on the packet-type.

The TPC BER is shown in Figures 9.1.4-1, 2 respectively for active-set size of

separately for each DL packet type. The TPC BERs for R99 and Solutions 1 and 3
are fairly close; Solution 1 is slightly better than R99 while Solution 3 is
slightly worse.

### 9.1.5 Link efficiency of AMR 5.9kbps codec
Figures 9.1.5-1,2 show the link-efficiency for active-set sizes of 1 and 2
respectively, for R99 and Solutions 1 and 3 assuming 50% voice activity
factor. Figures 9.1.5-3,4 show the link-efficiency gains over R99 realized by
Solutions 1 and 3. In most cases, there is a gain of around 2dB from Solution
1 and around 3.5dB from Solution 2, which is fairly insensitive to geometry.
The case of PA3 channel without handover is an exception for Solution 1, which
provides lower gain in this case, which further reduces at lower geometry.
This is due to loss of diversity and discontinuous inner-loop power control,
just as observed in the case of AMR 12.2kbps codec (clause 9.1.2). Figures
9.1.5-5 to 8 show the same quantities as Figures 9.1.5-1-4 respectively, but
separately for different AMR packet types. The link gains are also summarized
in Table 9.1.5-1.

### 9.1.6 Average decoding time and packet BLER for AMR 5.9kbps codec
Both Solutions 1 and 3 incorporate FET, and their average decoding times in
slots is shown in Figures 9.1.6-1,2 respectively for active-set size of 1,2,
when voice activity factor is 50%. Figures 9.1.6-3,4 show the decoding times
separately for each DL packet type. Since Solution 1 uses a 10ms TTI while
Solution 3 uses a 20ms TTI, the decoding time is much larger than
(approximately double) that in Solution 3. The smaller packets also decode
earlier.
As in the case of link efficiency (clause 9.1.5), the decoding time is mostly
insensitive to channel model and geometry, with the exception that Solution 1
has lower decoding time for PA3 at low geometry. This is due to more excess
SNR caused due to poor diversity, just as observed for the case of the AMR
12.2kbps codec (clause 9.1.3).
The target BLER of 1% for the voice packets was achieved in all cases
simulated except for the PA3 channel in absence of soft handover for geometry
of 3dB. Even in this case, the BLER was only slightly higher, i.e. 1-1.3%
depending on the packet-type.

The TPC BER is shown in Figures 9.1.7-1,2 respectively for active-set size of
1,2, when voice activity factor is 50%. Figures 9.1.7-3,4 show the TPC BERs
separately for each DL packet type. The TPC BERs for R99 and Solutions 1 and 3
are fairly close; Solution 1 is slightly better than R99 while Solution 3 is
slightly worse.

## 9.2 Link evaluation results: Downlink, Solutions 2 and 4
This clause presents link evaluation of downlink DCH enhancements described as
'Solution 2\' and 'Solution 4\' in clause 8. For better understanding,
\"E-WCDMA with TDM\" stands for \"Solution 2\" and \"E-WCDMA\" stands for
\"Solution 4\" in this clause.
Figure 9.2-1, Figure 9.2-2 and Figure 9.2-3 show the performance of DPCH Tx
Ec/Ior, BLER and TPC CER respectively for the aforementioned three schemes for
the case of single active set cell. In case of two active set cells, the
simulation results are presented in Figure 9.2-4 (averaged DPCH Tx Ec/Ior in
linear domain over two cells), Figure 9.2-5 and Figure 9.2-6 (averaged TPC CER
over two cells).

The averaged Ec/Ior reduction gain for E-WCDMA and E-WCDMA with TDM against
the legacy R99 system is summarized in Table 9.2-1 for single cell case and in
Table 9.2-2 for two active set cells case. The reduction gain (in dB) is
averaged over different geometry in dB domain.
Table 9.2-**1** : Averaged DPCH Tx Ec/Ior reduction gain in dB (averaged over
packet types) (single cell)

As seen in Table 9.2-1, E-WCDMA introduces an average of 3.36dB DPCH Tx Ec/Ior
reduction gain. With DPCH TDM, the reduction gain drops to 3.08dB, since TDM
is designed to relieve the constraints on code resource rather than power
resource. In this case, such 0.28dB loss of DPCH Tx Ec/Ior is traded into 50%
more effective users.
Moreover, Figure 9.2-7 \~ Figure 9.2-12 show the early termination statistics
for different packet types. Geometry is 6dB and cell number is one. Table
9.2-3 and Table 9.2-4 provide the averaged required slots for successful early
decoding. The average is over different channel models and different geometry.

## 9.3 Link evaluation results: Downlink, others
In addition to complete \"Solution 1\" \~ \"Solution 4\", some features are
simulated alone to make the report more comprehensive.
### 9.3.1 Simulation results for Pilot-Free DPCCH slot format
This clause shows the link simulation results on the DL DTCH BLER, TPC command
error rate and DPCH Ec/Ior for the new slot format #17 and #18 proposed in
clause 4.2.2, compared with those of legacy slot format #8. The link level
simulation results of slot format #19 and #20 are quite similar to those of
slot formats #17 and 18 respectively and hence are not presented here.
Simulation settings of the legacy slot format are listed in clause 8.
Additional simulation settings which are specific to the proposed new slot
formats are listed in Table 9.3.1-1 and Table 9.3.1-2.

Figure 9.3.1-1 and Figure 9.3.1-2 show the simulation results on DL DTCH BLER
for single link and 2-cell soft handover respectively. As seen the DL DTCH
BLERs are similar among different DL DPCCH slot formats, and the results
indicate that pilot removal has no performance degradation to the DL DTCH
BLER.

is averaged over all cells in active set, but not combined.
As seen in Table 9.3.1-3 and Table 9.3.1-4, the power reduction gain from

#### 9.3.1.1 Impact on SINR estimation mechanism
Table 9.3.1.1.1 shows a comparison of link performance due to impact of pilot
removal on SIR estimation.\ In this comparison, the performance of SIR
estimation based on joint TPC and dedicate pilot in DPCCH is compared against
SIR estimation based on TPC fields alone. As can be seen from this table,
there is little loss introduced by pilot removal due to worse SINR estimation
in comparison of joint TPC+pilot SIR estimation. However, the power reduction
gain from pilot removal is larger than the loss.

### 9.3.2 Simulation results for DL Frame Early Termination (FET) as described
in clause 4.2.1 along with Legacy DPCCH slot format
The system level simulation results of FET Option 2 based on Slot Format #8
are provided.
Link performance of Legacy R99 with \"Slot Format #8\" and that of ET with
\"Slot Format #8\" are presented in Figure 9.3.2-1 \~ Figure 9.3.2-6. DPCH Tx
Ec/Ior performance is shown in Figure 9.3.2-1, BLER in Figure 9.3.2-2, and TPC
CER in Figure 9.3.2-3 for single cell case. DPCH Tx Ec/Ior performance is
shown in Figure 9.3.2-4, BLER in Figure 9.3.2-5, and TPC CER in Figure 9.3.2-6
for two cells case. DPCH Tx Ec/Ior is averaged in linear domain for two cells.
TPC CER is also averaged for two cells. The average Ec/Ior reduction gain for
ET with \"Slot Format #8\" against Legacy R99 with \"Slot Format #8\" is
summarized in Table 9.3.2-1. The reduction gain (in dB) is averaged over
different geometry in dB domain.

It is observed 2.01dB \~ 2.64dB Ec/Ior benefit can be obtained in single cell

Moreover, Figure 9.3.2-7 \~ Figure 9.3.2-9 show the early termination
statistics for different packet types. Geometry is 6dB and cell number is one.
Comparing these three figures, it is found that if the packet size is smaller,
early termination may happen earlier. Table 9.3.2-2 provides the averaged
required slots for successful early decoding.\ The average is over different
channel models and different geometry.

## 9.4 Uplink link evaluation results: Solution 1
This clause presents link evaluation of uplink DCH enhancements described in
clause 8 (Solution 1). Several scenarios are considered, including active size
1 and 2, ILPC rate of 750Hz and 1500Hz, and the two codecs AMR12.2kbps and
AMR5.9kbps are studied.
### 9.4.1 Finger assignment assumptions
The Rake finger assignment assumed for UL evaluation of Solutions 1 are shown
in Table 9.4.1-1.
Table 9.4.1-1: Rake finger assignment in ITU channels
+---------+------------------------+ | Channel | Path delays | | | | | | (in 1/8^th^ of a chip) | +---------+------------------------+ | PA | 0,7 | +---------+------------------------+ | PB | 0,7,25,37,71,114 | +---------+------------------------+ | VA | 0,10,22,33,53,77 | +---------+------------------------+
### 9.4.2 Link efficiency of AMR 12.2kbps codec
In Figure 9.4.2-1 and Figure 9.4.2-2, the performance of Solution 1 in UL are
compared with legacy R99 in SHO and no SHO scenarios with active set size of 1
and 2 for AMR 12.2kbps. Two cases for ILPC rates, 1500Hz and 750Hz, are
considered. The averaging is performed assuming 50% voice activity. It is
observed that a significant improvement in average Ec/No is expected due to

Solution 3 is unchanged and similar gains are expected in Solution 1 also.

Finally, Figures 9.4.2-3 and 9.4.2-4 show a CDF of success rates for FET for
AMR12.2kbps codec. FET statistics do not include the NULL packet, which can be
terminated potentially in Solution 1 (or 3) after the first two slots of the
TTI, when the TFCI transmission carried over FET-DPCCH is completed. These
figures show that the statistics of FET are not quite sensitive to channel
profile, and in a significant percentage of time, even larger packets
terminate earlier than 10ms (the weight of FULL packets in this averaging is
about 88%, since NULL packets are excluded).

### 9.4.3 Link efficiency of AMR 5.9kbps codec
In Figure 9.4.3-1 and Figure 9.4.3-2, the performance of Solution 1 in UL are
compared with legacy R99 in SHO and no SHO scenarios with active set size of 1
and 2 for AMR 5.9kbps traffic. Two cases for ILPC rates, 1500Hz and 750Hz, are
considered. For AMR 5.9kbps also, the averaging is performed assuming 50%
voice activity.\ It is observed that a significant improvement in average
Ec/No is expected due to enhancements outlined in Solution 1. Compared to
AMR12.2kbps, the gain for AMR5.9kbps is slightly higher. This is because the
shorter packets in AMR 5.9kbps improve the chance of FET.

### 9.4.4 Summary of link efficiency gains due to Solution 1
The expected gains due to enhancements proposed in Solution 1 are summarized
in Tables 9.4.4-1 and 9.4.4-2.\ As can be seen, consistent improvements in the
order of 2dB or more are expected in all scenarios and channel conditions due
to proposed enhancements in UL as outlined in Solution 1.

## 9.5 Uplink link evaluation results: Solution 2
This clause presents link evaluation of uplink DCH enhancements described in
clause 8 (Solution 2).
In this clause, the simulation results for UL ET based on TFCI transmission
are presented. The simulation results of Legacy R99 based on TFCI transmission
are also presented for comparison.
Link performance of Legacy R99 and that of ET are presented in Table 9.5-1 and
Table 9.5-2 for \"single link\" case, and in Table 9.5-3 and Table 9.5-4 for
\"two links SHO (soft handover)\" case, respectively. The Ec/No benefit for ET
against Legacy R99 is summarized in Table 9.5-5.

As seen in Table 9.5-5, the proposed ET scheme introduces 1.6dB to 2.3dB Ec/No
gain depending on the fading channels and different link number.
Moreover, Figure 9.5-1 and Figure 9.5-2 show the early termination statistics
for packet types \"SID\" and \"FULL\". From Figure 9.5-1, when receiver
collects data of slot 0 \~ slot 6, it tries to decode the speech data, and the
successful detection rate is around 0.1 for every channel model when the
transmitted packet type is \"SID\". ACK is then transmitted for successful
detection; otherwise NACK is sent. At slot 29, the accumulated successful
detection rate is close to 0.99, which means BLER is close to 0.01. Comparing
these two figures, it is found that if the packet size is smaller, early
termination may happen earlier. Moreover, Table 9.5-6 provides the averaged
required slots for successful early decoding. The average is over different
channel models. UL is based on TFCI decoding. To realize early termination,
TFCI early decoding is also necessary. To have reliable decoding result, TFCI
decoding is performed after 7 slots are collected. Since there is no CRC for
NULL, whenever TFCI results is NULL, NULL is claimed and early termination
request is sent. Therefore, 7 slots are required for successful early decoding
on packet type \"NULL\".

### 10.1.2 Average Tx Ec/Ior per cell used by CS voice and BE users
Voice users Tx Ec/Ior is listed in in Table 10.1-2, for R99, DCH Enhancement
Solution 1 and Solution 3.
The averaged Tx Ec/Ior per cell used by HSDPA is decreasing with more voice
users, as shown in Table10.1-2.\ And with more DCH enhancement voice users,
the relative gain for the HSDPA Tx Ec/Ior is increasing, due to more available
power left to transmit HSDPA data. This explains that DCH enhancement can
effectively bring up the HSDPA BE UE throughput, as indicated by Table 10.1-1.

## 10.2 System evaluation results: Downlink, Solutions 2 and 4
This clause presents system evaluation of downlink DCH enhancements described
as 'Solution 2\' and 'Solution 4\' in clause 8. For better understanding,
\"E-WCDMA with TDM\" stands for \"Solution 2\" and \"E-WCDMA\" stands for
\"Solution 4\" in this clause. Perfect UE pairing has been assumed in the case
of the TDM Solution 2. Based on the simulation settings listed in clause 8,
the percentage of voice users with active set size of 1, 2 and 3 is listed in
Table 10.2-1.

Figure 10.2-1 and Figure 10.2-2 show the results of average cell throughput
with different numbers of voice users per cell for legacy R99 system, E-WCDMA
and E-WCDMA with TDM. The calculation of HSDPA throughput is based on the
simplified simulation methodology for HSPA throughput model in clause 8. As
seen in the figures, the HSDPA throughput of E-WCDMA with TDM is highest when
the number of voice users per cell is larger than eight.

The Tx Ec/Ior per cell used by voice users in PA3 and VA30 are shown in Figure
10.2-3 and Figure 10.2-4. As seen in the figures, there is a loss in Tx Ec/Ior
used by voice users in E-WCDMA with TDM when compared with those of E-WCDMA.
However, Table 10.2-3 presents that more SF-16 codes can be saved for HSDPA
when TDM is introduced. Due to more effective usage of code resouce, the
throughput in E-WCDMA with TDM is higher when the number of voice users per
cell is lager than eight.

# 11 Impact on implementation
In this clause, the required changes and associated complexity to implement
the proposed DCH enhancements are discussed.
## 11.1 Impact on infrastructure implementation
The proposed DCH enhancements require a number of modifications on the part of
network in DL and UL that are itemized and discussed in this clause.
### 11.1.1 New DL DPCH Slot Formats
The DL DPCH Slot Format is specified with parameters N~data1~, N~TPC~,
N~TFCI~, N~data2~, N~pilot~. DL DPCH slot format modifications require changes
to the values specified for these parameters. For example, pilot free slot
format corresponds to setting N~pilot~ = 0, similar to N~TFCI~ = 0 in BTFD.
TDM of users also requires changes in constructing slot formats for users. For
example, in clause 4.2.4.1 TDM option 1 for user pairing using 10ms TTI, two
users share TPC fields in the slot format.
### 11.1.2 New UL Slot Formats
In UL, proposed DCH enhancements require reconfiguration of N~data~, N~TPC~,
N~TFCI~, N~pilot~ like DL.
In addition, to maintain the ILPC timeline, two solutions are proposed in this
study. One described in clause 4.2.2.2 is to reconfigure DL slot format such
that TPC fields occupy the position of dedicated pilots in legacy slot format.
In another solution described in 4.1.1.1, position of TPC fields in UL DPCCH
slot format is changed to the beginning of the slot, instead of the end where
TPC fields are located in legacy slot format.
### 11.1.3 Rate Matching and Multiplexing
The encoding and decoding chains need to be modified to introduce changes to
multiplexing and rate matching as introduced in FET Option 2 in clause 4.1.1.2
and 4.2.1.2. The chain of blocks as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 in 3GPP TS
25.212 [4] are modified. In DL and UL, the order and mechanisms for
multiplexing, encoding, rate matching, and interleaving are changed.
  1. ### 11.1.4 FET ACK indication
    1. #### 11.1.4.1 I-Q multiplexed with the TPC symbols
The main modification is to multiplex TPC bit and ACK bit together.
#### 11.1.4.2 ACK on a new code channel
This is to introduce a new channel to carry ACK signaling for FET.
Implementation impact is to possibly allocate a new channelization code in DL,
and all associated implementations of slot formats, radio frame construction
and data encoding, along with power control mechanisms if the new channel is a
shared channel.
#### 11.1.4.3 ACK using spared TPC symbols
The main modification is to transmit TPC bits every alternate slots. In
addition, the freed TPC fields every alternate slot are possibly used for ACK
signaling, as for example in Solution 2. This solution requires modification
of TPC rate and hence changes to ILPC timeline and possible SINR estimation
algorithms.
### 11.1.5 UL FET-DPCCH
For the new channel, Node-B needs to implement a new channel to carry UL FET
control information such as TFCI and ACK.
### 11.1.6 New shared DCH channel for SRB over DCH
Shared DCH is a new channel designed based on legacy DCH. Implementation
impact is to allocate a new channelization code in DL, and all associated
implementations of slot formats, radio frame construction and data encoding,
along with handling power control for the shared channel, and software
modifications to signal user ID in control fields of shared DCH.
### 11.1.7 Frame early termination
Frame early termination requires changes in decoding chain, transmitting and
decoding ACK signals on DL and UL, respectively, and DL transceiver
termination in response to successful early decoding or receiving ACK signaled
on UL.
The decoding chain modifications require multiple trials of decoding the
transmitted packet, before the entire TTI worth of data is received. The
decoder simply assumes no information is available for unseen portion of the
TTI and attempts demultiplexing and decoding of the encoded frame. The main
complexity in decoding the packet are in sampling, match filtering,
equalization or rake combining, and Viterbi decoding. Complexity in sampling,
match filtering, and rake or equalizer processing remain unchanged to enable
multiple decoding attempts. Demultiplexing needs to be repeated multiple
times, however, the complexity of demultiplexing and de-rate-matching is not
considered to be significant.
Aside from symbol processing, Viterbi decoding is the other contributor to
complexity. However, since the packet sizes are relatively small in AMR 12.2k,
the code length in the worst case of FULL packet is less than 1000 bits. For
such short packets, Viterbi decoding is of relatively low complexity,
particularly in contrast to decoding larger packet sizes or turbo decoding.
Signaling DL ACK for UL FET requires changes in Node-B to encode and transmit
the ACK message. For example, the ACK message may be sent over spare TPC
fields (as proposed in clause 4.2.3.3) or be I/Q multiplexed with TPC symbols
(as proposed in clause 4.2.3.1). The ACK message on DL may also be sent over a
separate DL channel (as proposed in clause 4.2.3.2). On the receive side,
Node-B needs also to decode the UL ACK message.
Finally, FET requires the Node-B terminate transmission of DPCH upon receiving
UL ACK signal, and potentially terminate receiver processing upon successful
early decoding of UL channel. Despite DPDCH transmission can be terminated
upon receiving UL ACK message for DL FET, DPCCH channel may need to continue
transmission of TPC bits until UL transmission is also decoded and can be
terminated.
Another implementation requirement for frame early termination is increased
CRC size to allow reliable termination of early decoded frames. CRC size is
part of TFC specification and as part of new TFC implementation in proposed
DCH enhancements, new CRC sizes can be specified for CS traffic. CRC check
impact on complexity due to increase from 12 to 16 is negligible.
### 11.1.8 User pairing and extended SHO
TDM of multiple users and sharing OVSF codes among multiple users to free code
space may require the Node-B to allocate Tau-DPCH in a way such that user
pairing is optimized such that fewer codes are used in soft handover
scenarios. Relaxing requirements on SHO combining window delay also reduces
the complexity of implementation for user pairing in SHO, but may increase UE
complexity and reduce the time that UE can apply DRX.
## 11.2 Impact on UE Implementation
Similar to the network implementation, the proposed DCH enhancements require
some modifications at the UE in DL and UL that are itemized and discussed in
this clause.
### 11.2.1 New DL DPCH Slot Formats
In DL, DPCH is specified with parameters N~data1~, N~TPC~, N~TFCI~, N~data2~,
N~pilot~. DL DPCH slot format modifications require changes to the values
specified for these parameters. The UE receiver may need to be reconfigured to
collect the relevant bits according to new slot format parameters.
When TDM of users, UE also requires to only process relevant TDM slots (clause
4.2.4.2 TDM option 2), or slot format fields (clause 4.2.4.1 TDM option 1).
For example, in clause 4.2.4.1 TDM option 1 for user pairing using 10ms TTI,
UE should only process its own portion of TPC fields.
In addition, without dedicated pilot, the SINR estimation in ILPC operation
needs to be modified at the UE side. For example, the UE may use TPC bits to
measure SINR for the purpose of ILPC operation.
### 11.2.2 New UL Slot Formats
In UL, proposed DCH enhancements require reconfiguration of N~data~, N~TPC~,
N~TFCI~, N~pilot~ like DL. UE should reconfigure its UL slot format. The UL
slot formats proposed in this study are already defined in the specification;
however, some may not be defined for R99. In that case, UE needs to enable
using TFCI-free slot formats for voice traffic.
In addition, UE may need to restructure the fields in UL DPCCH to maintain the
ILPC timeline. As mentioned earlier in clause 11.1.2, two solutions are
possible as outlined in clause 4.2.2.2 and 4.1.1.1. One is to reconfigure DL
slot format such that TPC fields occupy the position of dedicated pilots in
legacy slot format. In another solution, position of TPC fields in UL DPCCH
slot format is changed to the beginning of the slot, instead of the end where
TPC fields are located in legacy slot format.
### 11.2.3 Rate Matching and Multiplexing
Similar to Node-B side, the encoding and decoding chains need to be modified
to introduce changes in multiplexing and rate matching as introduced in FET
Option 2 in clause 4.1.1.2 and 4.2.1.2. The affected blocks are shown in
Figure 1 and Figure 2 in 3GPP TS 25.212 [4]. The order and mechanisms for
multiplexing, encoding, rate matching, and interleaving are changed.
  1. ### 11.2.4 FET ACK indication
    1. #### 11.2.4.1 I-Q multiplexed with the TPC symbols
UE needs to decode the ACK, which is multiplexed with the TPC symbols.
#### 11.2.4.2 ACK on a new code channel
For the new channel, UE needs to implement a new de-spreading chain and
corresponding ACK decoding process.
#### 11.2.4.3 ACK using spared TPC symbols
The main modification by this design is to transmit TPC bits every alternate
slot. In addition, UE may need to modify encoding of TPC fields in UL DPCCH to
use the freed TPC fields every alternate slot possibly for ACK signaling.\ In
this case, the UE needs to change ILPC timeline for TPC rate reduction, and
possibly SINR estimation algorithms.
### 11.2.5 UL FET-DPCCH
This is to introduce a new channel. Implementation impact is to allocate a new
channelization code in UL, and all associated implementations of slot formats,
radio frame construction and TFCI/ACK encoding.
### 11.2.6 New shared DCH channel for SRB over DCH
For the shared DCH, UE in addition to implementing a new de-spreading chain to
monitor shared DCH channel, needs to monitor advertised user ID in shared DCH
to identify whether there is relevant data sent for UE.
### 11.2.7 Frame early termination
Like Node-B, frame early termination at UE requires changes in decoding chain,
transmitting and decoding ACK signals on UL and DL, respectively, and UL
transceiver termination in response to successful early decoding or receiving
ACK signaled on DL. Encoding chain remains mostly unchanged on the Node-B
side, except for in-band signaling of DCCH presence and increase in CRC
length.
The required changes to decoding chain are similar to those required for
Node-B. The increase in complexity comes from multiple Viterbi decoding
attempts, which is not significant due to short length of the voice packets.
Finally, FET requires the UE to terminate transmission of DPCH upon receiving
DL ACK signal, and terminate receiver processing upon successful early
decoding of DL channel.
## 11.3 Overview of feature benefits and complexity
Tables 11.3.1 and 11.3.2 provide an overall overview of the benefits and
complexity introduced as part of proposed DCH enhancements.

# 12 Impact on Specifications
## 12.1 Technical Specification 25.211
3GPP TS 25.211 **[15]** specifies physical channels and mapping of transport
channels onto physical channels.\ Below, a list of possible impacts on 3GPP TS
25.211 **[15]** is provided.
### 12.1.1 Clause 5.2.1.1 -- UL DPCCH and DPDCH
No changes needed for UL DPDCH slot format.
UL DPCCH slot format table in Table 2 needs modification to accommodate for
TFCI and ACK fields when UL ACK for DL FET is carried over DPCCH using TDM.
### 12.1.2 UL FET-DPCCH
A new clause 5.2.1.4 is needed to define UL FET-DPCCH channel. The new clause
mostly follows the specification of UL HS-DPCCH channel, with the key
difference of having TFCI fields in FET-DPCCH in place of CQI fields in HS-
DPCCH. The operation of ACK message is described in this subclause, where it
is specified how and when the UE transmits the ACK message to the Node-B.
### 12.1.3 DL DPDCH and DPCCH
New slot formats for DL DPDCH and DL DPCCH channels may need to be defined in
Table 11 of clause 5.3.2. Figure 9 of clause 5.3.2 can be updated in relation
to new slot format designs.
### 12.1.4 DL FET ACK Channel
A new channel may need to be specified to communicate the ACK channel on DL
for UL FET operation. In this case, a new subclause may be needed to specify
the associate slot formats in 3GPP TS 25.211 **[15]**.
## 12.2 Technical Specification 25.212
3GPP TS 25.212 [4] specifies multiplexing and channel coding. Below, potential
impact of DCH enhancement study item on this specification is provided.
### 12.2.1 Clause 4.2 -- General coding/multiplexing of TrCh
Changes to this clause are mainly due to design requirements for frame early
termination. The impact is different for different proposed solutions.
For DL FET with Option 1, the channel multiplexing and rate matching steps are
similar to legacy R99 as specified in clause 4.2. In UL FET with Option 1, the
TTI used for multiplexing is 10ms, and two 10ms radio frames are repeated back
to back to construct a 20ms voice frame. The specification of 10ms frame
repetition in Uplink can be achieved by adding a new figure after Figure 2 in
clause 4.2 to outline the repetition of 10ms frames.
For FET with Option 2, the channel multiplexing, interleaving, and rate
matching steps are changed to improve FET, in both DL and UL. Clause 4.2
requires revision in respective sub-clauses to specify new interleaving,
multiplexing, and rate matching, CRC concatenation, codeword segmentation, and
other corresponding blocks in transmission chain.
For FET with Option 3, a new clause preceding clause 4.2.2.3 and after clause
4.2.2.1 is added to specify concatenation of transport channels prior to
channel encoding. The pseudo-flexible rate matching algorithm described in
Option 3 can be specified by allowing different rate matching attributes
depending on TFC for downlink in clause 4.2.7.2, while the computation of the
rate matching attributes remains unaltered.
### 12.2.2 Clause 4.3.3 -- Coding of Transport-Format-Combination Indicator
(TFCI)
TFCI encoding strategies may be specified in clause 4.3.3, for example (20,5)
encoding specified for CQI encoding in HS channel can be reused for TFCI
encoding. Table 8 and Figure 9 may be modified or new tables added to specify
these options.
### 12.2.3 DL FET ACK Channel
A new channel may need to be specified to communicate the ACK channel on DL
for UL FET operation. In this case, a new subclause is needed to specify the
coding, and physical channel mapping and the operation of FET and ACK timeline
in clause 4.2.
## 12.3 Technical Specification 25.213
TS 25.213 specifies spreading and modulation. Some modifications may be needed
to 25.213 to support UL FET-DPCCH channel as a new control channel in UL.
### 12.3.1 Clause 4.2.1 -- Dedicated physical channels
To specify UL FET-DPCCH channel to support ACK for DL FET, Figure 1and Figure
1A need to be updated to include this channel on a separate channelization
code. Depending on whether a fixed power ratio for FET-DPCCH with respect to
DPCCH is used or this power offset can be signalled from the network, Table 1
may be modified to allow for a new scaling factor β _~f~._
### 12.3.2 Clause 4.3.1.2 -- Code allocation for dedicated physical channels
Clause 4.3.1.2.1 can be modified to specify the channelization code to be used
for FET-DPCCH channel. Similarly, if a new channel in DL is provisioned to
carry the ACK channel, the associated channelization code allocations may be
specified in this clause.
## 12.4 Technical Specification 25.214
3GPP TS 25.214 **[11]** specifies physical layer procedures. Some
modifications to this specification may be needed as follows.
### 12.4.1 Clause 5.2.1.1 -- General downlink power control
In DL FET with Option 2, the power ratio between DPDCH and DPCCH is dependent
on transport format combination (TFC). Hence, clause 5.2.1 may need to be
modified, similar to what is specified for UL in clause 5.1.3, to specify the
power offsets between DL DPDCH and DPCCH.
To allow modification of power control rate , clause 5.2.1.1 may be modified
other modes of operation in both downlink and uplink.
### 12.4.2 Appendix B.1 -- Power control timing
This clause may be modified to outline the new power control timings with
respect to changes to slot formats in DL and UL DPCH channels. Further,
informative power control timeline diagrams may be added to outline the power
control timing with new power control modes of operation.
# 13 Conclusion
A detailed link and system study on DCH enhancements was carried out and
promising gains were observed both in terms of user throughput when a mix of
CS voice and HS users were considered, and also in terms of voice capacity.
The following DCH enhancements were proposed and evaluated in the study:
  * DL Physical Layer Enhancements
    * DL DPCCH Slot Format Optimization
    * DL DPDCH Frame Early Termination
    * DL ACK Indicator design for UL FET
    * DPCH Time Domain Multiplexing
    * Reduced power control rate schemes

  1. 13.1 Conclusions on link evaluation results \-------------------------------------------
    1. ### 13.1.1 Conclusions on Downlink DCH enhancements
When the solutions are considered as a whole, the gains in transmit Ec/Ior
over R99 CS voice on the downlink ranged from 0.9dB to 3.69dB for AMR 12.2K
and from 1.2dB to 3.8dB for AMR 5.9K. The gains are more significant and
similar for multipath and vehicular channels and are slightly lower for
Pedestrian A channels at low geometries without soft handover.
For DPCH slot format optimization alone, the gains in transmit Ec/Ior for AMR
12.2K ranged from 0.94dB to 1.29dBfor Solution 2. When DL FET alone is
considered, the gains in transmit Ec/Ior for AMR 12.2K ranged from 2.01dB to
2.64dB. When TDM was considered, the average gains reduced by around 0.3dB for
Solution 2.\ However, the TDM feature is designed to relieve the constraints
on code resources as opposed to providing larger gains on link efficiency. The
use of TDM enables the number of voice users to be increased by around 50%.
### 13.1.2 Conclusions on Uplink DCH enhancements
When the solutions are considered as a whole, the gains in average Ec/No over
R99 CS voice on the uplink ranged from 1.6dB to 2.54dB for AMR 12.2K and from
2.3dB to 2.7dB for AMR 5.9K. The gains are more significant and similar for
multipath and vehicular channels and are slightly lower for Pedestrian A
channels.
## 13.2 Conclusions on system evaluation results
System evaluations were considered for a mix of CS voice and HSPA users. The
gains were evaluated in terms of user throughput for HS users for a fixed
number of CS voice users.
On the downlink, the throughput gains for HSPA users when DCH enhancements was
applied to the voice users ranged on average from 20% to 80% at a voice load
of 32 voice users per cell.
A summary of the gains obtained from the downlink system evaluations is shown
in Table 13.2-1

## 13.3 Comparison with VoHSPA
VoHSPA performance has been evaluated in 3GPP TR 25.903 [10] in clauses
4.2.2.4.4 and 4.8.2.3 respectively for uplink and downlink. The system
capacity of VoHSPA is comparable to that of DCH enhancements both in terms of
voice capacity and the throughput of HSPA users in a mixed voice-data
scenario.
The outage performance of Rel-7 VoHSPA is worse than DCH enhancements; however
it is considered that this difference may be reduced by the implementation of
enhanced serving cell change or alternatively multiflow HSDPA with bi-casting
or by the use of advanced receivers (eg. dual Rx antennas) at the cost of an
increase in UE current consumption.
## 13.4 Impact on Modem current consumption and implementation complexity
In addition to the performance gains, DCH Enhancements affords the UE the
opportunity to turn off its transceiver once a voice frame has decoded on the
downlink and the uplink thereby improving UE battery life. The UE can gate its
transceiver once it successfully decodes the DL channel, transmits the ACK
indicator on the uplink and receives the ACK message on the DL indicating
successful decoding of UL channel at Node-B.
An analysis on the percentage of time that the transceiver can be gated based
on the DL and UL FET statistics was conducted and it was shown that the UE has
the opportunity to gate the transceiver around **63%** of the time for
Solution 1, around **34%** of the time in Solution 3, and around **40%** of
the time in Solution 2 and 4.
The implementation impact of the proposed DCH enhancements has also been
considered both from the UE and the UTRAN perspectives. For more details on
the impacts to implementation, see clause 11. The impact on the specifications
has also been discussed in clause 12. In general, it is considered that the
proposed enhancements to DCH operation are not too complex to implement or to
specify.
